Strand 2: Structures and Processes of Life

In Strand 2, students explore how the unique structures within living organisms enable essential life processes at cellular, organ, and systemic levels. This strand emphasizes the transfer of energy, matter, and information through processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, cell division, and protein synthesis. Students investigate how cells, organs, and systems interact to maintain homeostasis and facilitate exchanges with the environment.

2.2. Cellular processes – photosynthesis and respiration
Students learn about:
