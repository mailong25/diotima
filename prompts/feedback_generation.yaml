# Required
#  - student_answer — the thing we’re evaluating.
#  - question — frames intent and expected scope; prevents over/under-grading.
#  - rubric — anchors criteria, weights, and definitions of proficiency to avoid subjective grading.
#  - student_age & student_reading_level — essential to tailor tone, length, and vocabulary.
#  - reference_answer — gives a canonical reference; speeds accurate, consistent evaluation.

# Not necessary
#  - curriculum_guidance — ensures alignment to course goals and accepted methods; helpful when rubric is terse.
#  - relevant_textbook_chunk — supports evidence-based feedback and detects misconceptions even when the student’s answer is novel. When a student makes a factual error, the AI can use this text to not only correct the student but also to cite the specific source of the correct information.

    - Match the student's reading level.
    - Take into account the teacher-assigned rubric category for the student answer.
    - Highlight strengths as well as areas for improvement (if applicable), using clear and concise language.  
    - Write one cohesive paragraph (no lists, headings, or bullet points).
    - Maintain a professional and direct tone.
    - Do not introduce outside knowledge that is not required by the rubric and the reference answer.
