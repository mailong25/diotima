The first forms of life on Earth are thought\nbe microorganisms that existed for billions of years in the ocean before plants and animals appeared. The mammals, birds,\nand flowers that we see in modern times are mostly \u201crecent\u201d species, originating 130 to 200 million years ago. In fact, only\nin the last 200,000 years have humans started looking like we do today.\nOrganisms evolve in response to each other. One of the best examples is disease causing organisms, which have to adapt\nto overcome the defenses of the organisms they infect. One such organism that has evolved to specialize in infection in\nhumans is Plasmodium, the organism that causes malaria. Biologists use the process of science to learn about the world and\nthe organisms living in it. For example, people have suspected for quite some time that people with blood type O are less\nlikely to die from severe malaria. Now, a team of scientists have been able to explain why. By examining data from several\nexperiments, and by using both inductive and deductive reasoning, the scientists concluded that A and B type blood reacts\nwith a protein excreted by Plasmodium. This reaction causes severe illness. However, type O blood does not react with\nthe protein. You can read more (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32plasmodium) about the response of type A and B blood\ngroups to infection by Plasmodium.\n1.1 | The Science of Biology\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the characteristics shared by the natural sciences?\n\u2022\nWhat are the steps of the scientific method?\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\n9\nConnection for AP\u00ae courses\nBiology is the science that studies living organisms and their interactions with one another and with their environment. The\nprocess of science attempts to describe and understand the nature of the universe by rational means. Science has many fields;\nthose fields related to the physical world, including biology, are considered natural sciences. All of the natural sciences\nfollow the laws of chemistry and physics. For example, when studying biology, you must remember living organisms obey\nthe laws of thermodynamics while using free energy and matter from the environment to carry out life processes that are\nexplored in later chapters, such as metabolism and reproduction.\nTwo types of logical reasoning are used in science: inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning\nuses particular results to produce general scientific principles. Deductive reasoning uses logical thinking to predict results\nby applying scientific principles or practices. The scientific method is a step-by-step process that consists of: making\nobservations, defining a problem, posing hypotheses, testing these hypotheses by designing and conducting investigations,\nand drawing conclusions from data and results. Scientists then communicate their results to the scientific community.\nScientific theories are subject to revision as new information is collected.\nThe content presented in this section supports the Learning Objectives outlined in Big Idea 2 of the AP\u00ae Biology\nCurriculum Framework. The Learning Objectives merge Essential Knowledge content with one or more of the seven\nScience Practices. These objectives provide a transparent foundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, along with inquiry-based\nlaboratory experiences, instructional activities, and AP\u00ae Exam questions.\nBig Idea 2\nBiological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to\nreproduce, and to maintain dynamic homeostasis.\nEnduring\nUnderstanding 2.A\nGrowth, reproduction and maintenance of living systems require free energy and matter.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n2.A.1 All living systems require constant input of free energy.\nScience Practice\n6.4 The student can make claims and predictions about natural phenomena based on\nscientific theories and models\nLearning\nObjectives\n2.3 The student is able to predict how changes in free energy availability affect\norganisms, populations and ecosystems.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 1.2 Formerly called blue-green algae, these (a) cyanobacteria, shown here at 300x magnification under a light\nmicroscope, are some of Earth\u2019s oldest life forms.

In simple terms, biology is the study of living organisms and their interactions with one another and their\nenvironments. This is a very broad definition because the scope of biology is vast. Biologists may study anything from\nthe microscopic or submicroscopic view of a cell to ecosystems and the whole living planet (Figure 1.2). Listening to the\ndaily news, you will quickly realize how many aspects of biology are discussed every day. For example, recent news topics\n10\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\ninclude Escherichia coli (Figure 1.3) outbreaks in spinach and Salmonella contamination in peanut butter. On a global\nscale, many researchers are committed to finding ways to protect the planet, solve environmental issues, and reduce the\neffects of climate change. All of these diverse endeavors are related to different facets of the discipline of biology.\nFigure 1.3 Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria, seen in this scanning electron micrograph, are normal residents of our\ndigestive tracts that aid in the absorption of vitamin K and other nutrients. However, virulent strains are sometimes\nresponsible for disease outbreaks. (credit: Eric Erbe, digital colorization by Christopher Pooley, both of USDA, ARS,\nEMU)\nThe Process of Science\nBiology is a science, but what exactly is science? What does the study of biology share with other scientific disciplines?\nScience (from the Latin scientia, meaning \u201cknowledge\u201d) can be defined as knowledge that covers general truths or the\noperation of general laws, especially when acquired and tested by the scientific method. It becomes clear from this definition\nthat the application of the scientific method plays a major role in science. The scientific method is a method of research\nwith defined steps that include experiments and careful observation.\nThe steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later, but one of the most important aspects of this method is\nthe testing of hypotheses by means of repeatable experiments. A hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an event, which\ncan be tested. Although using the scientific method is inherent to science, it is inadequate in determining what science is.\nThis is because it is relatively easy to apply the scientific method to disciplines such as physics and chemistry, but when it\ncomes to disciplines like archaeology, psychology, and geology, the scientific method becomes less applicable as it becomes\nmore difficult to repeat experiments.\nThese areas of study are still sciences, however. Consider archaeology\u2014even though one cannot perform repeatable\nexperiments, hypotheses may still be supported. For instance, an archaeologist can hypothesize that an ancient culture\nexisted based on finding a piece of pottery. Further hypotheses could be made about various characteristics of this culture,\nand these hypotheses may be found to be correct or false through continued support or contradictions from other findings. A\nhypothesis may become a verified theory. A theory is a tested and confirmed explanation for observations or phenomena.\nScience may be better defined as fields of study that attempt to comprehend the nature of the universe.\nNatural Sciences\nWhat would you expect to see in a museum of natural sciences? Frogs? Plants? Dinosaur skeletons? Exhibits about how the\nbrain functions? A planetarium? Gems and minerals? Or, maybe all of the above? Science includes such diverse fields as\nastronomy, biology, computer sciences, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, and mathematics (Figure 1.4). However, those\nfields of science related to the physical world and its phenomena and processes are considered natural sciences. Thus, a\nmuseum of natural sciences might contain any of the items listed above.\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\n11\nFigure 1.4 The diversity of scientific fields includes astronomy, biology, computer science, geology, logic, physics,\nchemistry, mathematics, and many other fields. (credit: \u201cImage Editor\u201d/Flickr)\nThere is no complete agreement when it comes to defining what the natural sciences include, however. For some experts,\nthe natural sciences are astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. Other scholars choose to divide natural\nsciences into life sciences, which study living things and include biology, and physical sciences, which study nonliving\nmatter and include astronomy, geology, physics, and chemistry. Some disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build\non both life and physical sciences and are interdisciplinary. Natural sciences are sometimes referred to as \u201chard science\u201d\nbecause they rely on the use of quantitative data; social sciences that study society and human behavior are more likely to\nuse qualitative assessments to drive investigations and findings.\nNot surprisingly, the natural science of biology has many branches or subdisciplines. Cell biologists study cell structure\nand function, while biologists who study anatomy investigate the structure of an entire organism. Those biologists studying\nphysiology, however, focus on the internal functioning of an organism. Some areas of biology focus on only particular types\nof living things. For example, botanists explore plants, while zoologists specialize in animals.\nScientific Reasoning\nOne thing is common to all forms of science: an ultimate goal \u201cto know.\u201d Curiosity and inquiry are the driving forces for the\ndevelopment of science. Scientists seek to understand the world and the way it operates. To do this, they use two methods\nof logical thinking: inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning.\nInductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses related observations to arrive at a general conclusion. This type\nof reasoning is common in descriptive science. A life scientist such as a biologist makes observations and records them.\nThese data can be qualitative or quantitative, and the raw data can be supplemented with drawings, pictures, photos, or\nvideos. From many observations, the scientist can infer conclusions (inductions) based on evidence. Inductive reasoning\ninvolves formulating generalizations inferred from careful observation and the analysis of a large amount of data. Brain\nstudies provide an example. In this type of research, many live brains are observed while people are doing a specific activity,\nsuch as viewing images of food. The part of the brain that \u201clights up\u201d during this activity is then predicted to be the part\ncontrolling the response to the selected stimulus, in this case, images of food. The \u201clighting up\u201d of the various areas of the\nbrain is caused by excess absorption of radioactive sugar derivatives by active areas of the brain. The resultant increase in\nradioactivity is observed by a scanner. Then, researchers can stimulate that part of the brain to see if similar responses result.\nDeductive reasoning or deduction is the type of logic used in hypothesis-based science. In deductive reason, the pattern\nof thinking moves in the opposite direction as compared to inductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning is a form of logical\n12\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nthinking that uses a general principle or law to forecast specific results. From those general principles, a scientist can\nextrapolate and predict the specific results that would be valid as long as the general principles are valid. Studies in climate\nchange can illustrate this type of reasoning. For example, scientists may predict that if the climate becomes warmer in a\nparticular region, then the distribution of plants and animals should change. These predictions have been made and tested,\nand many such changes have been found, such as the modification of arable areas for agriculture, with change based on\ntemperature averages.\nBoth types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study: descriptive science and hypothesis-\nbased science. Descriptive (or discovery) science, which is usually inductive, aims to observe, explore, and discover, while\nhypothesis-based science, which is usually deductive, begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or\nsolution that can be tested. The boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred, and most scientific endeavors\ncombine both approaches. The fuzzy boundary becomes apparent when thinking about how easily observation can lead to\nspecific questions. For example, a gentleman in the 1940s observed that the burr seeds that stuck to his clothes and his dog\u2019s\nfur had a tiny hook structure. On closer inspection, he discovered that the burrs\u2019 gripping device was more reliable than a\nzipper. He eventually developed a company and produced the hook-and-loop fastener often used on lace-less sneakers and\nathletic braces. Descriptive science and hypothesis-based science are in continuous dialogue.\nThe Scientific Method\nBiologists study the living world by posing questions about it and seeking science-based responses. This approach is\ncommon to other sciences as well and is often referred to as the scientific method. The scientific method was used even in\nancient times, but it was first documented by England\u2019s Sir Francis Bacon (1561\u20131626) (Figure 1.5), who set up inductive\nmethods for scientific inquiry. The scientific method is not exclusively used by biologists but can be applied to almost all\nfields of study as a logical, rational problem-solving method.\nFigure 1.5 Sir Francis Bacon (1561\u20131626) is credited with being the first to define the scientific method. (credit: Paul\nvan Somer)\nThe scientific process typically starts with an observation (often a problem to be solved) that leads to a question. Let\u2019s think\nabout a simple problem that starts with an observation and apply the scientific method to solve the problem. One Monday\nmorning, a student arrives at class and quickly discovers that the classroom is too warm. That is an observation that also\ndescribes a problem: the classroom is too warm. The student then asks a question: \u201cWhy is the classroom so warm?\u201d\nProposing a Hypothesis\nRecall that a hypothesis is a suggested explanation that can be tested. To solve a problem, several hypotheses may be\nproposed. For example, one hypothesis might be, \u201cThe classroom is warm because no one turned on the air conditioning.\u201d\nBut there could be other responses to the question, and therefore other hypotheses may be proposed. A second hypothesis\nmight be, \u201cThe classroom is warm because there is a power failure, and so the air conditioning doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\n13\nOnce a hypothesis has been selected, the student can make a prediction. A prediction is similar to a hypothesis but it\ntypically has the format \u201cIf . . . then . . . .\u201d For example, the prediction for the first hypothesis might be, \u201cIf the student turns\non the air conditioning, then the classroom will no longer be too warm.\u201d\nTesting a Hypothesis\nA valid hypothesis must be testable. It should also be falsifiable, meaning that it can be disproven by experimental\nresults. Importantly, science does not claim to \u201cprove\u201d anything because scientific understandings are always subject to\nmodification with further information. This step\u2014openness to disproving ideas\u2014is what distinguishes sciences from non-\nsciences. The presence of the supernatural, for instance, is neither testable nor falsifiable. To test a hypothesis, a researcher\nwill conduct one or more experiments designed to eliminate one or more of the hypotheses. Each experiment will have one\nor more variables and one or more controls. A variable is any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the\nexperiment. The control group contains every feature of the experimental group except it is not given the manipulation\nthat is hypothesized about. Therefore, if the results of the experimental group differ from the control group, the difference\nmust be due to the hypothesized manipulation, rather than some outside factor. Look for the variables and controls in\nthe examples that follow. To test the first hypothesis, the student would find out if the air conditioning is on. If the air\nconditioning is turned on but does not work, there should be another reason, and this hypothesis should be rejected. To test\nthe second hypothesis, the student could check if the lights in the classroom are functional. If so, there is no power failure\nand this hypothesis should be rejected. Each hypothesis should be tested by carrying out appropriate experiments. Be aware\nthat rejecting one hypothesis does not determine whether or not the other hypotheses can be accepted; it simply eliminates\none hypothesis that is not valid (see this figure). Using the scientific method, the hypotheses that are inconsistent with\nexperimental data are rejected.\nWhile this \u201cwarm classroom\u201d example is based on observational results, other hypotheses and experiments might have\nclearer controls. For instance, a student might attend class on Monday and realize she had difficulty concentrating on the\nlecture. One observation to explain this occurrence might be, \u201cWhen I eat breakfast before class, I am better able to pay\nattention.\u201d The student could then design an experiment with a control to test this hypothesis.\nIn hypothesis-based science, specific results are predicted from a general premise. This type of reasoning is called deductive\nreasoning: deduction proceeds from the general to the particular. But the reverse of the process is also possible: sometimes,\nscientists reach a general conclusion from a number of specific observations. This type of reasoning is called inductive\nreasoning, and it proceeds from the particular to the general. Inductive and deductive reasoning are often used in tandem to\nadvance scientific knowledge (see this figure)\nThink About It\nAlmost all plants use water, carbon dioxide, and energy from the sun to make sugars. Think about what would happen\nto plants that don\u2019t have sunlight as an energy source or sufficient water. What would happen to organisms that depend\non those plants for their own survival?\nMake a prediction about what would happen to the organisms living in a rain forest if 50% of its trees were destroyed.\nHow would you test your prediction?\n14\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 1.6 The scientific method consists of a series of well-defined steps. If a hypothesis is not supported by\nexperimental data, a new hypothesis can be proposed.\nIn the example below, the scientific method is used to solve an everyday problem. Order the scientific method steps\n(numbered items) with the process of solving the everyday problem (lettered items). Based on the results of the\nexperiment, is the hypothesis correct? If it is incorrect, propose some alternative hypotheses.\nScientific\nMethod\nEveryday process\n1\nObservation\nA\nThere is something wrong with the electrical outlet.\n2\nQuestion\nB\nIf something is wrong with the outlet, my coffeemaker also won\u2019t work when\nplugged into it.\n3\nHypothesis (answer) C\nMy toaster doesn\u2019t toast my bread.\n4\nPrediction\nD\nI plug my coffee maker into the outlet.\n5\nExperiment\nE\nMy coffeemaker works.\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\n15\nScientific\nMethod\nEveryday process\n6\nResult\nF\nWhat is preventing my toaster from working?\na.\nThe original hypothesis is correct.

As is the case in this example, the conclusion from inductive reasoning can often become the premise\nfor deductive reasoning.\nDecide if each of the following is an example of inductive or deductive reasoning.\n1.\nAll flying birds and insects have wings. Birds and insects flap their wings as they move through the air. Therefore,\nwings enable flight.\n2.\nInsects generally survive mild winters better than harsh ones. Therefore, insect pests will become more\nproblematic if global temperatures increase.\n3.\nChromosomes, the carriers of DNA, separate into daughter cells during cell division. Therefore, DNA is the\ngenetic material.\n4.\nAnimals as diverse as insects and wolves all exhibit social behavior. Therefore, social behavior must have an\nevolutionary advantage for humans.\na.\n1- Inductive, 2- Deductive, 3- Deductive, 4- Inductive\nb.\n1- Deductive, 2- Inductive, 3- Deductive, 4- Inductive\nc.\n1- Inductive, 2- Deductive, 3- Inductive, 4- Deductive\nd.\n1- Inductive, 2-Inductive, 3- Inductive, 4- Deductive\nThe scientific method may seem too rigid and structured. It is important to keep in mind that, although scientists often\nfollow this sequence, there is flexibility. Sometimes an experiment leads to conclusions that favor a change in approach;\noften, an experiment brings entirely new scientific questions to the puzzle. Many times, science does not operate in a linear\nfashion; instead, scientists continually draw inferences and make generalizations, finding patterns as their research proceeds.\nScientific reasoning is more complex than the scientific method alone suggests. Notice, too, that the scientific method can\nbe applied to solving problems that aren\u2019t necessarily scientific in nature.\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\n17\nTwo Types of Science: Basic Science and Applied Science\nThe scientific community has been debating for the last few decades about the value of different types of science. Is it\nvaluable to pursue science for the sake of simply gaining knowledge, or does scientific knowledge only have worth if we\ncan apply it to solving a specific problem or to bettering our lives? This question focuses on the differences between two\ntypes of science: basic science and applied science.\nBasic science or \u201cpure\u201d science seeks to expand knowledge regardless of the short-term application of that knowledge.\nIt is not focused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value. The immediate goal of\nbasic science is knowledge for knowledge\u2019s sake, though this does not mean that, in the end, it may not result in a practical\napplication.\nIn contrast, applied science or \u201ctechnology,\u201d aims to use science to solve real-world problems, making it possible, for\nexample, to improve a crop yield, find a cure for a particular disease, or save animals threatened by a natural disaster (Figure\n1.8). In applied science, the problem is usually defined for the researcher.\nFigure 1.8 After Hurricane Ike struck the Gulf Coast in 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rescued this brown\npelican. Thanks to applied science, scientists knew how to rehabilitate the bird. (credit: FEMA)\nSome individuals may perceive applied science as \u201cuseful\u201d and basic science as \u201cuseless.\u201d A question these people might\npose to a scientist advocating knowledge acquisition would be, \u201cWhat for?\u201d A careful look at the history of science,\nhowever, reveals that basic knowledge has resulted in many remarkable applications of great value. Many scientists think\nthat a basic understanding of science is necessary before an application is developed; therefore, applied science relies on\nthe results generated through basic science. Other scientists think that it is time to move on from basic science and instead\nto find solutions to actual problems. Both approaches are valid. It is true that there are problems that demand immediate\nattention; however, few solutions would be found without the help of the wide knowledge foundation generated through\nbasic science.\nOne example of how basic and applied science can work together to solve practical problems occurred after the discovery of\nDNA structure led to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing DNA replication. Strands of DNA, unique\nin every human, are found in our cells, where they provide the instructions necessary for life. During DNA replication,\nDNA makes new copies of itself, shortly before a cell divides. Understanding the mechanisms of DNA replication enabled\nscientists to develop laboratory techniques that are now used to identify genetic diseases. Without basic science, it is\nunlikely that applied science would exist.\nAnother example of the link between basic and applied research is the Human Genome Project, a study in which each\nhuman chromosome was analyzed and mapped to determine the precise sequence of DNA subunits and the exact location\nof each gene. (The gene is the basic unit of heredity; an individual\u2019s complete collection of genes is his or her genome.)\nOther less complex organisms have also been studied as part of this project in order to gain a better understanding of human\nchromosomes. The Human Genome Project (Figure 1.9) relied on basic research carried out with simple organisms and,\nlater, with the human genome. An important end goal eventually became using the data for applied research, seeking cures\nand early diagnoses for genetically related diseases.\n18\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 1.9 The Human Genome Project was a 13-year collaborative effort among researchers working in several\ndifferent fields of science. The project, which sequenced the entire human genome, was completed in 2003. (credit:\nthe U.S. Department of Energy Genome Programs (http://genomics.energy.gov))\nWhile research efforts in both basic science and applied science are usually carefully planned, it is important to note that\nsome discoveries are made by serendipity, that is, by means of a fortunate accident or a lucky surprise. Penicillin was\ndiscovered when biologist Alexander Fleming accidentally left a petri dish of Staphylococcus bacteria open. An unwanted\nmold grew on the dish, killing the bacteria. The mold turned out to be Penicillium, and a new antibiotic was discovered.\nEven in the highly organized world of science, luck\u2014when combined with an observant, curious mind\u2014can lead to\nunexpected breakthroughs.\nReporting Scientific Work\nWhether scientific research is basic science or applied science, scientists must share their findings in order for other\nresearchers to expand and build upon their discoveries. Collaboration with other scientists\u2014when planning, conducting,\nand analyzing results\u2014are all important for scientific research. For this reason, important aspects of a scientist\u2019s work are\ncommunicating with peers and disseminating results to peers. Scientists can share results by presenting them at a scientific\nmeeting or conference, but this approach can reach only the select few who are present. Instead, most scientists present their\nresults in peer-reviewed manuscripts that are published in scientific journals. Peer-reviewed manuscripts are scientific\npapers that are reviewed by a scientist\u2019s colleagues, or peers. These colleagues are qualified individuals, often experts\nin the same research area, who judge whether or not the scientist\u2019s work is suitable for publication. The process of peer\nreview helps to ensure that the research described in a scientific paper or grant proposal is original, significant, logical, and\nthorough. Grant proposals, which are requests for research funding, are also subject to peer review. Scientists publish their\nwork so other scientists can reproduce their experiments under similar or different conditions to expand on the findings. The\nexperimental results must be consistent with the findings of other scientists.\nA scientific paper is very different from creative writing. Although creativity is required to design experiments, there are\nfixed guidelines when it comes to presenting scientific results. First, scientific writing must be brief, concise, and accurate.\nA scientific paper needs to be succinct but detailed enough to allow peers to reproduce the experiments.\nThe scientific paper consists of several specific sections\u2014introduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion. This\nstructure is sometimes called the \u201cIMRaD\u201d format. There are usually acknowledgment and reference sections as well as an\nabstract (a concise summary) at the beginning of the paper. There might be additional sections depending on the type of\npaper and the journal where it will be published; for example, some review papers require an outline.\nThe introduction starts with brief, but broad, background information about what is known in the field. A good introduction\nalso gives the rationale of the work; it justifies the work carried out and also briefly mentions the end of the paper, where\nthe hypothesis or research question driving the research will be presented. The introduction refers to the published scientific\nwork of others and therefore requires citations following the style of the journal. Using the work or ideas of others without\nproper citation is considered plagiarism.\nThe materials and methods section includes a complete and accurate description of the substances used, and the method\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\n19\nand techniques used by the researchers to gather data. The description should be thorough enough to allow another\nresearcher to repeat the experiment and obtain similar results, but it does not have to be verbose. This section will also\ninclude information on how measurements were made and what types of calculations and statistical analyses were used to\nexamine raw data. Although the materials and methods section gives an accurate description of the experiments, it does not\ndiscuss them.\nSome journals require a results section followed by a discussion section, but it is more common to combine both. If the\njournal does not allow the combination of both sections, the results section simply narrates the findings without any further\ninterpretation. The results are presented by means of tables or graphs, but no duplicate information should be presented.\nIn the discussion section, the researcher will interpret the results, describe how variables may be related, and attempt to\nexplain the observations. It is indispensable to conduct an extensive literature search to put the results in the context of\npreviously published scientific research. Therefore, proper citations are included in this section as well.\nFinally, the conclusion section summarizes the importance of the experimental findings. While the scientific paper almost\ncertainly answered one or more scientific questions that were stated, any good research should lead to more questions.\nTherefore, a well-done scientific paper leaves doors open for the researcher and others to continue and expand on the\nfindings.\nReview articles do not follow the IMRAD format because they do not present original scientific findings, or primary\nliterature; instead, they summarize and comment on findings that were published as primary literature and typically include\nextensive reference sections.\n1.2 | Themes and Concepts of Biology\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022\nIdentify and describe the properties of life\n\u2022\nDescribe the levels of organization among living things\n\u2022\nRecognize and interpret a phylogenetic tree\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe AP\u00ae Biology curriculum is organized around four major themes called the Big Ideas that apply to all levels of\nbiological organization\u2014from molecules and cells to populations and ecosystems. Each Big Idea identifies key concepts\ncalled Enduring Understandings, and Essential Knowledges, along with supporting examples. Simple descriptions define\nthe focus of each Big Idea: Big Idea 1, Evolution; Big Idea 2, Energy and Homeostasis; Big Idea 3, Information and\nCommunication; and Big Idea 4, Systems and Interactions. Evolution explains both the unity and diversity of life, Big Idea\n1, and all organisms require energy and molecules to carry out life functions, such as growth and reproduction, Big Idea 2.\nLiving systems also store, transmit, and respond to information, from DNA sequences to nerve impulses and behaviors, Big\nIdea 3. All biological systems interact, and these interactions result in emergent properties and characteristics unique to life,\nBig Idea 4.\nThe redesigned AP\u00ae Biology course also emphasizes the investigative practices that students should master. Scientific\ninquiry usually uses a series of steps to gain new knowledge.

        "summary": "The science of biology is the study of living organisms and their interactions with each other and their environments, falling under the broader category of natural sciences, which follow the laws of chemistry and physics. Biologists use both inductive reasoning, which draws general conclusions from observations, and deductive reasoning, which predicts specific results from general principles, often combining descriptive and hypothesis-based approaches. Central to biology is the scientific method\u2014a flexible, logical process involving observations, questions, hypotheses, predictions, experiments with variables and controls, and conclusions, with hypotheses needing to be testable and falsifiable. Biology encompasses both basic (knowledge-driven) and applied (problem-solving) science, which often work together, as seen in advances like the Human Genome Project. Scientific work is communicated through peer-reviewed publications that follow a structured format, enabling replication and further research, ultimately contributing to a growing, revisable understanding of the natural world."

The description should be thorough enough to allow another\nresearcher to repeat the experiment and obtain similar results, but it does not have to be verbose. This section will also\ninclude information on how measurements were made and what types of calculations and statistical analyses were used to\nexamine raw data. Although the materials and methods section gives an accurate description of the experiments, it does not\ndiscuss them.\nSome journals require a results section followed by a discussion section, but it is more common to combine both. If the\njournal does not allow the combination of both sections, the results section simply narrates the findings without any further\ninterpretation. The results are presented by means of tables or graphs, but no duplicate information should be presented.\nIn the discussion section, the researcher will interpret the results, describe how variables may be related, and attempt to\nexplain the observations. It is indispensable to conduct an extensive literature search to put the results in the context of\npreviously published scientific research. Therefore, proper citations are included in this section as well.\nFinally, the conclusion section summarizes the importance of the experimental findings. While the scientific paper almost\ncertainly answered one or more scientific questions that were stated, any good research should lead to more questions.\nTherefore, a well-done scientific paper leaves doors open for the researcher and others to continue and expand on the\nfindings.\nReview articles do not follow the IMRAD format because they do not present original scientific findings, or primary\nliterature; instead, they summarize and comment on findings that were published as primary literature and typically include\nextensive reference sections.\n1.2 | Themes and Concepts of Biology\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022\nIdentify and describe the properties of life\n\u2022\nDescribe the levels of organization among living things\n\u2022\nRecognize and interpret a phylogenetic tree\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe AP\u00ae Biology curriculum is organized around four major themes called the Big Ideas that apply to all levels of\nbiological organization\u2014from molecules and cells to populations and ecosystems. Each Big Idea identifies key concepts\ncalled Enduring Understandings, and Essential Knowledges, along with supporting examples. Simple descriptions define\nthe focus of each Big Idea: Big Idea 1, Evolution; Big Idea 2, Energy and Homeostasis; Big Idea 3, Information and\nCommunication; and Big Idea 4, Systems and Interactions. Evolution explains both the unity and diversity of life, Big Idea\n1, and all organisms require energy and molecules to carry out life functions, such as growth and reproduction, Big Idea 2.\nLiving systems also store, transmit, and respond to information, from DNA sequences to nerve impulses and behaviors, Big\nIdea 3. All biological systems interact, and these interactions result in emergent properties and characteristics unique to life,\nBig Idea 4.\nThe redesigned AP\u00ae Biology course also emphasizes the investigative practices that students should master. Scientific\ninquiry usually uses a series of steps to gain new knowledge. The scientific method begins with an observation and follows\nwith a hypothesis to explain the observation; then experiments are conducted to test the hypothesis, gather results, and draw\nconclusions from data. The AP\u00ae program has identified seven major categories of Science Practices, which can be described\nby short phrases: using representations and models to communicate information and solve problems; using mathematics\nappropriately; engaging in questioning; planning and implementing data collection strategies; analyzing and evaluating\ndata; justifying scientific explanations; and connecting concepts.

This may sound like a silly question with an obvious\nresponse, but it is not always easy to define life. For example, a branch of biology called virology studies viruses, which\nexhibit some of the characteristics of living entities but lack others. It turns out that although viruses can attack living\norganisms, cause diseases, and even reproduce, they do not meet the criteria that biologists use to define life. Consequently,\nvirologists are not biologists, strictly speaking. Similarly, some biologists study the early molecular evolution that gave rise\nto life; since the events that preceded life are not biological events, these scientists are also excluded from biology in the\nstrict sense of the term.\nFrom its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with three questions: What are the shared properties that make something\n\u201calive\u201d? And once we know something is alive, how do we find meaningful levels of organization in its structure? And,\nfinally, when faced with the remarkable diversity of life, how do we organize the different kinds of organisms so that we\ncan better understand them? As new organisms are discovered every day, biologists continue to seek answers to these and\nother questions.\nProperties of Life\nAll living organisms share several key characteristics or functions: order, sensitivity or response to the environment,\nreproduction, adaptation, growth and development, regulation, homeostasis, energy processing, and evolution. When\nviewed together, these nine characteristics serve to define life.\nOrder\nFigure 1.10 A toad represents a highly organized structure consisting of cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems.\n(credit: \u201cIvengo\u201d/Wikimedia Commons)\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\n21\nOrganisms are highly organized, coordinated structures that consist of one or more cells. Even very simple, single-celled\norganisms are remarkably complex: inside each cell, atoms make up molecules; these in turn make up cell organelles and\nother cellular inclusions. In multicellular organisms (Figure 1.10), similar cells form tissues. Tissues, in turn, collaborate to\ncreate organs (body structures with a distinct function). Organs work together to form organ systems.\nSensitivity or Response to Stimuli\nFigure 1.11 The leaves of this sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica) will instantly droop and fold when touched. After a few\nminutes, the plant returns to normal. (credit: Alex Lomas)\nOrganisms respond to diverse stimuli. For example, plants can bend toward a source of light, climb on fences and walls, or\nrespond to touch (Figure 1.11). Even tiny bacteria can move toward or away from chemicals (a process called chemotaxis)\nor light (phototaxis). Movement toward a stimulus is considered a positive response, while movement away from a stimulus\nis considered a negative response.\nWatch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/movement_plants) to see how plants respond to a stimulus\u2014from\nopening to light, to wrapping a tendril around a branch, to capturing prey.\nWhich example most clearly shows a way that humans can respond directly to a change in the environment?\na.\nWe shiver when we are cold and sweat when we are hot.\nb.\nWe walk by putting our front leg forward and pushing off with our back leg.\nc.\nWe are able to breath in and out unconsciously.\nd.\nOur hair and fingernails grow at a constant rate over time.\nReproduction\nSingle-celled organisms reproduce by first duplicating their DNA, and then dividing it equally as the cell prepares to divide\nto form two new cells. Multicellular organisms often produce specialized reproductive germline cells that will form new\nindividuals. When reproduction occurs, genes containing DNA are passed along to an organism\u2019s offspring. These genes\nensure that the offspring will belong to the same species and will have similar characteristics, such as size and shape.\nGrowth and Development\nOrganisms grow and develop following specific instructions coded for by their genes. These genes provide instructions that\n22\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nwill direct cellular growth and development, ensuring that a species\u2019 young (Figure 1.12) will grow up to exhibit many of\nthe same characteristics as its parents.\nFigure 1.12 Although no two look alike, these kittens have inherited genes from both parents and share many of the\nsame characteristics. (credit: Rocky Mountain Feline Rescue)\nRegulation\nEven the smallest organisms are complex and require multiple regulatory mechanisms to coordinate internal functions,\nrespond to stimuli, and cope with environmental stresses. Two examples of internal functions regulated in an organism are\nnutrient transport and blood flow. Organs (groups of tissues working together) perform specific functions, such as carrying\noxygen throughout the body, removing wastes, delivering nutrients to every cell, and cooling the body.\nHomeostasis\nFigure 1.13 Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) and other mammals living in ice-covered regions maintain their body\ntemperature by generating heat and reducing heat loss through thick fur and a dense layer of fat under their skin.\n(credit: \u201clonghorndave\u201d/Flickr)\nIn order to function properly, cells need to have appropriate conditions such as proper temperature, pH, and appropriate\nconcentration of diverse chemicals. These conditions may, however, change from one moment to the next. Organisms\nare able to maintain internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly, despite environmental changes, through\nhomeostasis (literally, \u201csteady state\u201d). For example, an organism needs to regulate body temperature through a process\nknown as thermoregulation. Organisms that live in cold climates, such as the polar bear (Figure 1.13), have body structures\nthat help them withstand low temperatures and conserve body heat. Structures that aid in this type of insulation include fur,\nfeathers, blubber, and fat. In hot climates, organisms have methods (such as perspiration in humans or panting in dogs) that\nhelp them to shed excess body heat.\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\n23\nEnergy Processing\nFigure 1.14 The California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) uses chemical energy derived from food to power flight.\nCalifornia condors are an endangered species; this bird has a wing tag that helps biologists identify the individual.\n(credit: Pacific Southwest Region U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)\nAll organisms use a source of energy for their metabolic activities. Some organisms capture energy from the sun and convert\nit into chemical energy in food; others use chemical energy in molecules they take in as food (Figure 1.14).\nActivity\nSelect an ecosystem of your choice, such as a tropical rainforest, desert, or coral reef, and create a\nrepresentation to show how several organisms found in the ecosystem interact with each other and the\nenvironment. Then, using similarities and differences among the organisms make a hypothesis about their\nrelatedness.\nConsider the levels of organization of the biological world and create a diagram to place these items in order\nfrom the smallest level of organization to the most encompassing: skin cell, planet Earth, elephant, tropical\nrainforest, water molecule, liver, wolf pack, and oxygen atom. Justify the reason why you placed the items\nin the hierarchy that you did.\nThink About It\nHomeostasis\u2014the ability to \u201cstay the same\u201d\u2014is a feature shared by all living organisms. You go for a long\nwalk on a hot day. Describe how homeostasis keeps your body healthy even though you are sweating\nprofusely. Then describe an example of an adaptation that evolved in a desert plant or animal that allows\nthem to survive in extreme temperatures.\nLevels of Organization of Living Things\nLiving things are highly organized and structured, following a hierarchy that can be examined on a scale from small to\nlarge. The atom is the smallest and most fundamental unit of matter. It consists of a nucleus surrounded by electrons. Atoms\nform molecules. A molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical\nbonds. Many molecules that are biologically important are macromolecules, large molecules that are typically formed by\npolymerization (a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers, which are simpler\n24\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nthan macromolecules). An example of a macromolecule is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (Figure 1.15), which contains the\ninstructions for the structure and functioning of all living organisms.\nFigure 1.15 All molecules, including this DNA molecule, are composed of atoms. (credit: \u201cbrian0918\u201d/Wikimedia\nCommons)\nWatch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/rotating_DNA) that animates the three-dimensional structure of the\nDNA molecule shown in this figure.\nThe word helix means spiral. What does this tell you about the structure of DNA, which is a double helix\nmacromolecule?\na.\nThe nucleotides of the two strands bond together with spiral bonds.\nb.\nA double-stranded DNA molecule has two spiral stands bound together.\nc.\nDNA is a double helix because it has two spiral strands held together like a spiral staircase.\nd.\nNucleotides are spiral-shaped molecules that bond together to form DNA.\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\n25\nSome cells contain aggregates of macromolecules surrounded by membranes; these are called organelles. Organelles are\nsmall structures that exist within cells. Examples of organelles include mitochondria and chloroplasts, which carry out\nindispensable functions: mitochondria produce energy to power the cell, while chloroplasts enable green plants to utilize\nthe energy in sunlight to make sugars. All living things are made of cells; the cell itself is the smallest fundamental unit of\nstructure and function in living organisms. (This requirement is why viruses are not considered living: they are not made of\ncells. To make new viruses, they have to invade and hijack the reproductive mechanism of a living cell; only then can they\nobtain the materials they need to reproduce.) Some organisms consist of a single cell and others are multicellular. Cells are\nclassified as prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Prokaryotes are single-celled or colonial organisms that do not have membrane-\nbound nuclei; in contrast, the cells of eukaryotes do have membrane-bound organelles and a membrane-bound nucleus.\nIn larger organisms, cells combine to make tissues, which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related\nfunctions. Organs are collections of tissues grouped together performing a common function. Organs are present not only\nin animals but also in plants. An organ system is a higher level of organization that consists of functionally related organs.\nMammals have many organ systems. For instance, the circulatory system transports blood through the body and to and from\nthe lungs; it includes organs such as the heart and blood vessels. Organisms are individual living entities. For example,\neach tree in a forest is an organism. Single-celled prokaryotes and single-celled eukaryotes are also considered organisms\nand are typically referred to as microorganisms.\nAll the individuals of a species living within a specific area are collectively called a population. For example, a forest may\ninclude many pine trees. All of these pine trees represent the population of pine trees in this forest. Different populations\nmay live in the same specific area. For example, the forest with the pine trees includes populations of flowering plants and\nalso insects and microbial populations. A community is the sum of populations inhabiting a particular area. For instance,\nall of the trees, flowers, insects, and other populations in a forest form the forest\u2019s community. The forest itself is an\necosystem. An ecosystem consists of all the living things in a particular area together with the abiotic, non-living parts\nof that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or rain water. At the highest level of organization (see this figure), the\nbiosphere is the collection of all ecosystems, and it represents the zones of life on earth. It includes land, water, and even\nthe atmosphere to a certain extent.\n26\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 1.16 The biological levels of organization of living things are shown. From a single organelle to the entire\nbiosphere, living organisms are parts of a highly structured hierarchy.

The\nsource of this diversity is evolution, the process of gradual change during which new species arise from older species.\nEvolutionary biologists study the evolution of living things in everything from the microscopic world to ecosystems.\nThe evolution of various life forms on Earth can be summarized in a phylogenetic tree (Figure 1.17). A phylogenetic tree is\na diagram showing the evolutionary relationships among biological species based on similarities and differences in genetic\nor physical traits or both. A phylogenetic tree is composed of nodes and branches. The internal nodes represent ancestors\nand are points in evolution when, based on scientific evidence, an ancestor is thought to have diverged to form two new\nspecies. The length of each branch is proportional to the time elapsed since the split.\nFigure 1.17 This phylogenetic tree was constructed by microbiologist Carl Woese using data obtained from\nsequencing ribosomal RNA genes. The tree shows the separation of living organisms into three domains: Bacteria,\nArchaea, and Eukarya. Bacteria and Archaea are prokaryotes, single-celled organisms lacking intracellular organelles.\n(credit: Eric Gaba; NASA Astrobiology Institute)\n28\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nCarl Woese and the Phylogenetic Tree\nIn the past, biologists grouped living organisms into five kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, protists, and\nbacteria. The organizational scheme was based mainly on physical features, as opposed to physiology,\nbiochemistry, or molecular biology, all of which are used by modern systematics. The pioneering work of\nAmerican microbiologist Carl Woese in the early 1970s has shown, however, that life on Earth has evolved\nalong three lineages, now called domains\u2014Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The first two are prokaryotic\ncells with microbes that lack membrane-enclosed nuclei and organelles. The third domain contains the\neukaryotes and includes unicellular microorganisms together with the four original kingdoms (excluding\nbacteria). Woese defined Archaea as a new domain, and this resulted in a new taxonomic tree (see this\nfigure). Many organisms belonging to the Archaea domain live under extreme conditions and are called\nextremophiles. To construct his tree, Woese used genetic relationships rather than similarities based on\nmorphology (shape).\nWoese\u2019s tree was constructed from comparative sequencing of the genes that are universally distributed,\npresent in every organism, and conserved (meaning that these genes have remained essentially unchanged\nthroughout evolution). Woese\u2019s approach was revolutionary because comparisons of physical features are\ninsufficient to differentiate between the prokaryotes that appear fairly similar in spite of their tremendous\nbiochemical diversity and genetic variability (Figure 1.18). The comparison of homologous DNA and RNA\nsequences provided Woese with a sensitive device that revealed the extensive variability of prokaryotes,\nand which justified the separation of the prokaryotes into two domains: bacteria and archaea.\nFigure 1.18 These images represent different domains. The (a) bacteria in this micrograph belong to Domain\nBacteria, while the (b) extremophiles (not visible) living in this hot vent belong to Domain Archaea. Both the\n(c) sunflower and (d) lion are part of Domain Eukarya.

Why?\na.\nArchaea, because fish are multicellular.\nb.\nEukarya, because fish are multicellular.\nc.\nArchaea, because fish are single-celled.\nd.\nEukarya because fish are single-celled.\n30\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nPhylogenetic trees can represent traits that are derived or lost due to evolution. One example is the\nabsence of legs in some sea mammals. For example, Cetaceans are marine mammals that include toothed\nwhales, such as dolphins and killer whales, and baleen whales, such as humpback whales. Cetaceans are\ndescended from even-toed ungulates and share a common ancestry with the hippopotamus, cow, sheep,\ncamel, and pig.\nFigure 1.19\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\n31\nPhylogenetic trees can represent traits that are derived or lost due to evolution. One example is the absence of legs in\nsome marine mammals. One such group is the Cetaceans, which includes toothed whales, such as dolphins and killer\nwhales, and baleen whales, such as humpback whales. Cetaceans are descended from even-toed ungulates and share a\ncommon ancestry with the hippopotamus, cows, sheep, camel, and pig. Based on this phylogenetic tree, which of the\nfollowing animal is the most closely related to a horse?\na.\nan armadillo\nb.\na camel\nc.\na bat\nd.\na cat\nBranches of Biological Study\nThe scope of biology is broad and therefore contains many branches and subdisciplines. Biologists may pursue one of\nthose subdisciplines and work in a more focused field. For instance, molecular biology and biochemistry study biological\nprocesses at the molecular and chemical level, including interactions among molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins,\nas well as the way they are regulated. Microbiology, the study of microorganisms, is the study of the structure and function\nof organisms that cannot be seen with the naked eye. It is quite a broad branch itself, and depending on the subject of study,\nthere are also microbial physiologists, ecologists, and geneticists, among others.\n32\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nForensic science is the application of science to answer questions related to the law. Biologists as well\nas chemists and biochemists can be forensic scientists. Forensic scientists provide scientific evidence for\nuse in courts, and their job involves examining trace materials associated with crimes. Interest in forensic\nscience has increased in the last few years, possibly because of popular television shows that feature\nforensic scientists on the job. Also, the development of molecular techniques and the establishment of DNA\ndatabases have expanded the types of work that forensic scientists can do. Their work involves analyzing\nsamples such as hair, blood, and other body fluids and also processing DNA (Figure 1.20) found in many\ndifferent environments and materials. Forensic scientists also analyze other biological evidence left at crime\nscenes, such as insect larvae or pollen grains. Students who want to pursue careers in forensic science will\nmost likely be required to take chemistry and biology courses as well as some intensive math courses.\nFigure 1.20 This forensic scientist works in a DNA extraction room at the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation\nLaboratory at Fort Gillem, GA. (credit: United States Army CID Command Public Affairs)\nAnother field of biological study, neurobiology, studies the biology of the nervous system, and although it is considered\na branch of biology, it is also recognized as an interdisciplinary field of study known as neuroscience. Because of its\ninterdisciplinary nature, this subdiscipline studies different functions of the nervous system using molecular, cellular,\ndevelopmental, medical, and computational approaches.\nFigure 1.21 Researchers work on excavating dinosaur fossils at a site in Castell\u00f3n, Spain. (credit: Mario Modesto)\nPaleontology, another branch of biology, uses fossils to study life\u2019s history (Figure 1.21). Zoology and botany are the\nstudy of animals and plants, respectively. Biologists can also specialize as biotechnologists, ecologists, or physiologists, to\nname just a few areas. This is just a small sample of the many fields that biologists can pursue.\nChapter 1 | The Study of Life\n33\nBiology is the culmination of the achievements of the natural sciences from their inception to today.

(credit: modification of work by Christian Guthier)\nChapter Outline\n2.1: Atoms, Isotopes, Ions, and Molecules: The Building Blocks\n2.2: Water\n2.3: Carbon\nIntroduction\nAll matter, including living things, is made up of various combinations of elements. Some of the most abundant elements\nin living organisms include carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus. These elements form the major\nbiological molecules\u2014nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids\u2014that are the fundamental components of living\nmatter. Biologists study these important molecules to understand their unique structures which determine their specialized\nfunctions.\nAll biological processes follow the laws of physics and chemistry. Therefore, in order to understand how biological systems\nwork, it is important to understand the underlying physics and chemistry. For example, the flow of blood within the\ncirculatory system follows the laws of physics regulating the modes of fluid flow. Chemical laws dictate the breakdown of\nlarge, complex food molecules into smaller molecules as well as their conversion to energy stored in adenosine triphosphate\n(ATP). Polar molecules, the formation of hydrogen bonds, and the resulting properties of water are key to understanding\nliving processes. Recognizing the properties of acids and bases is important to understand various biological processes such\nas digestion. Therefore, the fundamentals of physics and chemistry are the foundation for gaining insight into biological\nprocesses.\nAn example of how understanding of chemical processes can give insight to a biological process is recent research on\nseasonal affective disorder (SAD). This form of depression affects up to 10% of the population in the fall and winter.\nSymptoms include a tendency to overeat, oversleep, lack of energy, and difficulty concentrating on tasks. Now scientists\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\n41\nhave found out that not only may SAD be caused by a deficiency in vitamin D, but that it is more common in individuals\nwith darker skin pigmentation. You can read more about it here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32vitdsad) .\n2.1 | Atoms, Isotopes, Ions, and Molecules: The\nBuilding Blocks\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow does atomic structure determine the properties of elements, molecules, and matter?\n\u2022\nWhat are the differences among ionic bonds, covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds, and hydrogen bonds?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nLiving systems obey the laws of chemistry and physics. Matter is anything that occupies space and mass. The 92 naturally\noccurring elements have unique properties, and various combinations of them create molecules, which combine to form\norganelles, cells, tissues, organ system, and organisms. Atoms, which consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons, are the\nsmallest units of matter that retain all their characteristics and are most stable when their outermost or valence electron\nshells contain the maximum number of electrons. Electrons can be transferred, shared, or cause charge disparities between\natoms to create bonds, including ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds, as well as van del Waals interactions. Isotopes are\ndifferent forms of an element that have different numbers of neutrons while retaining the same number of protons; many\nisotopes, such as carbon-14, are radioactive.\nThe information presented and examples highlighted in this section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined\nin Big Idea 2 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework.

There are 118 elements, but only 98 occur naturally. The remaining elements are\nsynthesized in laboratories and are unstable.\nEach element is designated by its chemical symbol, which is a single capital letter or, when the first letter is already \u201ctaken\u201d\nby another element, a combination of two letters. Some elements follow the English term for the element, such as C for\ncarbon and Ca for calcium. Other elements\u2019 chemical symbols derive from their Latin names; for example, the symbol for\nsodium is Na, referring to natrium, the Latin word for sodium.\nThe four elements common to all living organisms are oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N). In the non-\nliving world, elements are found in different proportions, and some elements common to living organisms are relatively rare\non the earth as a whole, as shown in Table 2.1. For example, the atmosphere is rich in nitrogen and oxygen but contains\nlittle carbon and hydrogen, while the earth\u2019s crust, although it contains oxygen and a small amount of hydrogen, has little\nnitrogen and carbon. In spite of their differences in abundance, all elements and the chemical reactions between them obey\nthe same chemical and physical laws regardless of whether they are a part of the living or non-living world.\nApproximate Percentage of Elements in Living Organisms (Humans) Compared\nto the Non-living World\nElement\nLife (Humans)\nAtmosphere\nEarth\u2019s Crust\nOxygen (O)\n65%\n21%\n46%\nCarbon (C)\n18%\ntrace\ntrace\nHydrogen (H)\n10%\ntrace\n0.1%\nNitrogen (N)\n3%\n78%\ntrace\nTable 2.1\nThe Structure of the Atom\nTo understand how elements come together, we must first discuss the smallest component or building block of an element,\nthe atom. An atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties of an element. For example, one\ngold atom has all of the properties of gold in that it is a solid metal at room temperature. A gold coin is simply a very large\nnumber of gold atoms molded into the shape of a coin and containing small amounts of other elements known as impurities.\nGold atoms cannot be broken down into anything smaller while still retaining the properties of gold.\nAn atom is composed of two regions: the nucleus, which is in the center of the atom and contains protons and neutrons, and\nthe outermost region of the atom which holds its electrons in orbit around the nucleus, as illustrated in Figure 2.2. Atoms\ncontain protons, electrons, and neutrons, among other subatomic particles. The only exception is hydrogen (H), which is\nmade of one proton and one electron with no neutrons.\nFigure 2.2 Elements, such as helium, depicted here, are made up of atoms. Atoms are made up of protons and\nneutrons located within the nucleus, with electrons in orbitals surrounding the nucleus.\nProtons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, about 1.67 \u00d7 10-24 grams. Scientists arbitrarily define this amount\nof mass as one atomic mass unit (amu) or one Dalton, as shown in Table 2.2. Although similar in mass, protons and neutrons\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\n43\ndiffer in their electric charge. A proton is positively charged whereas a neutron is uncharged. Therefore, the number of\nneutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass, but not to its charge. Electrons are much smaller in mass than\nprotons, weighing only 9.11 \u00d7 10-28 grams, or about 1/1800 of an atomic mass unit. Hence, they do not contribute much to an\nelement\u2019s overall atomic mass. Therefore, when considering atomic mass, it is customary to ignore the mass of any electrons\nand calculate the atom\u2019s mass based on the number of protons and neutrons alone. Although not significant contributors\nto mass, electrons do contribute greatly to the atom\u2019s charge, as each electron has a negative charge equal to the positive\ncharge of a proton. In uncharged, neutral atoms, the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus is equal to the number of\nprotons inside the nucleus. In these atoms, the positive and negative charges cancel each other out, leading to an atom with\nno net charge.\nAccounting for the sizes of protons, neutrons, and electrons, most of the volume of an atom\u2014greater than 99 percent\u2014is, in\nfact, empty space. With all this empty space, one might ask why so-called solid objects do not just pass through one another.\nThe reason they do not is that the electrons that surround all atoms are negatively charged and negative charges repel each\nother.\nProtons, Neutrons, and Electrons\nCharge\nMass (amu)\nLocation\nProton\n+1\n1\nnucleus\nNeutron 0\n1\nnucleus\nElectron \u20131\n0\norbitals\nTable 2.2\nAtomic Number and Mass\nAtoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons. The number of protons determines an\nelement\u2019s atomic number and is used to distinguish one element from another. The number of neutrons is variable, resulting\nin isotopes, which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess. Together, the\nnumber of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element\u2019s mass number, as illustrated in this figure. Note that\nthe small contribution of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number. This approximation of mass\ncan be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the\nmass number. Since an element\u2019s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers, scientists also determine the atomic\nmass, which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes. Often, the resulting number\ncontains a fraction. For example, the atomic mass of chlorine (Cl) is 35.45 because chlorine is composed of several isotopes,\nsome (the majority) with atomic mass 35 (17 protons and 18 neutrons) and some with atomic mass 37 (17 protons and 20\nneutrons).\n44\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 2.3 Carbon has an atomic number of six, and two stable isotopes with mass numbers of twelve and\nthirteen, respectively. Its relative atomic mass is 12.011.\nHow many neutrons do carbon-12 and carbon-13 have, respectively?\na.\nCarbon-12 contains 6 neutrons while carbon-13 contains 7 neutrons.\nb.\nCarbon-12 contains 7 neutrons while carbon-13 contains 6 neutrons.\nc.\nCarbon-12 contains 12 neutrons while carbon-13 contains 13 neutrons.\nd.\nCarbon-12 contains 13 neutrons while carbon-13 contains 12 neutrons.\nIsotopes\nIsotopes are different forms of an element that have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons.\nSome elements\u2014such as carbon, potassium, and uranium\u2014have naturally occurring isotopes. Carbon-12 contains six\nprotons, six neutrons, and six electrons; therefore, it has a mass number of 12 (six protons and six neutrons). Carbon-14\ncontains six protons, eight neutrons, and six electrons; its atomic mass is 14 (six protons and eight neutrons). These two\nalternate forms of carbon are isotopes. Some isotopes may emit neutrons, protons, and electrons, and attain a more stable\natomic configuration (lower level of potential energy); these are radioactive isotopes, or radioisotopes. Radioactive decay\n(carbon-14 losing neutrons to eventually become nitrogen-14) describes the energy loss that occurs when an unstable atom\u2019s\nnucleus releases radiation.\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\n45\nCarbon Dating\nCarbon is normally present in the atmosphere in the form of gaseous compounds like carbon dioxide and\nmethane. Carbon-14 (14C) is a naturally occurring radioisotope that is created in the atmosphere from\natmospheric 14N (nitrogen) by the addition of a neutron and the loss of a proton because of cosmic rays.\nThis is a continuous process, so more 14C is always being created. As a living organism incorporates 14C\ninitially as carbon dioxide fixed in the process of photosynthesis, the relative amount of 14C in its body is\nequal to the concentration of 14C in the atmosphere. When an organism dies, it is no longer ingesting 14C,\nso the ratio between 14C and 12C will decline as 14C decays gradually to 14N by a process called beta\ndecay\u2014the emission of electrons or positrons. This decay gives off energy in a slow process.\nAfter approximately 5,730 years, half of the starting concentration of 14C will have been converted back to\n14N. The time it takes for half of the original concentration of an isotope to decay back to its more stable\nform is called its half-life. Because the half-life of 14C is long, it is used to date formerly living objects such\nas old bones or wood. Comparing the ratio of the 14C concentration found in an object to the amount of 14C\ndetected in the atmosphere, the amount of the isotope that has not yet decayed can be determined. On the\nbasis of this amount, the age of the material, such as the pygmy mammoth shown in Figure 2.4, can be\ncalculated with accuracy if it is not much older than about 50,000 years. Other elements have isotopes with\ndifferent half lives. For example, 40K (potassium-40) has a half-life of 1.25 billion years, and 235U (Uranium\n235) has a half-life of about 700 million years. Through the use of radiometric dating, scientists can study\nthe age of fossils or other remains of extinct organisms to understand how organisms have evolved from\nearlier species.\nFigure 2.4 The age of carbon-containing remains less than about 50,000 years old, such as this pygmy mammoth,\ncan be determined using carbon dating. (credit: Bill Faulkner, NPS)\nBased on carbon dating, scientists estimate this pygmy mammoth died 11,000 years ago. How would the ratio of\n14 C to 12 C in a living elephant compare to the 14 C to 12 C ratio found in the mammoth?\na.\nThe ratio would be the same in the elephant and the mammoth.\nb.\nThe ratio would be lower in the elephant than the mammoth.\nc.\nThe ratio would be higher in the elephant than the mammoth.\nd.\nThe ratio would depend on the diet of each animal.\n46\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nTo learn more about atoms, isotopes, and how to tell one isotope from another, visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/\nl/atoms_isotopes) and run the simulation.\nK-41 is one of the naturally occurring isotopes of potassium.

Devised by Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev\n(1834\u20131907) in 1869, the table groups elements that, although unique, share certain chemical properties with other\nelements. The properties of elements are responsible for their physical state at room temperature: they may be gases, solids,\nor liquids. Elements also have specific chemical reactivity, the ability to combine and to chemically bond with each other.\nIn the periodic table, shown in Figure 2.5, the elements are organized and displayed according to their atomic number and\nare arranged in a series of rows and columns based on shared chemical and physical properties. In addition to providing\nthe atomic number for each element, the periodic table also displays the element\u2019s atomic mass. Looking at carbon, for\nexample, its symbol (C) and name appear, as well as its atomic number of six (in the upper left-hand corner) and its atomic\nmass of 12.11.\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\n47\nFigure 2.5 The periodic table shows the atomic mass and atomic number of each element. The atomic number\nappears above the symbol for the element and the approximate atomic mass appears below it.\nThe periodic table groups elements according to chemical properties. The differences in chemical reactivity between the\nelements are based on the number and spatial distribution of an atom\u2019s electrons. Atoms that chemically react and bond\nto each other form molecules. Molecules are simply two or more atoms chemically bonded together. Logically, when two\natoms chemically bond to form a molecule, their electrons, which form the outermost region of each atom, come together\nfirst as the atoms form a chemical bond.\nElectron Shells and the Bohr Model\nIt should be stressed that there is a connection between the number of protons in an element, the atomic number that\ndistinguishes one element from another, and the number of electrons it has. In all electrically neutral atoms, the number of\nelectrons is the same as the number of protons. Thus, each element, at least when electrically neutral, has a characteristic\nnumber of electrons equal to its atomic number.\nAn early model of the atom was developed in 1913 by Danish scientist Niels Bohr (1885\u20131962). The Bohr model shows the\natom as a central nucleus containing protons and neutrons, with the electrons in circular orbitals at specific distances from\nthe nucleus, as illustrated in Figure 2.6. These orbits form electron shells or energy levels, which are a way of visualizing\nthe number of electrons in the outermost shells. These energy levels are designated by a number and the symbol \u201cn.\u201d For\nexample, 1n represents the first energy level located closest to the nucleus.\n48\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 2.6 The Bohr model was developed by Niels Bohr in 1913. In this model, electrons exist within principal shells.\nAn electron normally exists in the lowest energy shell available, which is the one closest to the nucleus. Energy from\na photon of light can bump it up to a higher energy shell, but this situation is unstable, and the electron quickly decays\nback to the ground state. In the process, a photon of light is released.\nElectrons fill orbitals in a consistent order: they first fill the orbitals closest to the nucleus, then they continue to fill orbitals\nof increasing energy further from the nucleus. If there are multiple orbitals of equal energy, they will be filled with one\nelectron in each energy level before a second electron is added. The electrons of the outermost energy level determine the\nenergetic stability of the atom and its tendency to form chemical bonds with other atoms to form molecules.\nUnder standard conditions, atoms fill the inner shells first, often resulting in a variable number of electrons in the outermost\nshell. The innermost shell has a maximum of two electrons but the next two electron shells can each have a maximum of\neight electrons. This is known as the octet rule, which states, with the exception of the innermost shell, that atoms are\nmore stable energetically when they have eight electrons in their valence shell, the outermost electron shell. Examples of\nsome neutral atoms and their electron configurations are shown in this figure. Notice that in this Figure 2.7, helium has\na complete outer electron shell, with two electrons filling its first and only shell. Similarly, neon has a complete outer 2n\nshell containing eight electrons. In contrast, chlorine and sodium have seven and one in their outer shells, respectively, but\ntheoretically they would be more energetically stable if they followed the octet rule and had eight.\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\n49\nFigure 2.7 Bohr diagrams indicate how many electrons fill each principal shell. Group 18 elements (helium,\nneon, and argon are shown) have a full outer, or valence, shell. A full valence shell is the most stable electron\nconfiguration. Elements in other groups have partially filled valence shells and gain or lose electrons to achieve a\nstable electron configuration.\n50\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nAn atom may give, take, or share electrons with another atom to achieve a full valence shell, the most stable electron\nconfiguration. Looking at this figure, how many electrons do elements in group 1 need to lose in order to achieve a\nstable electron configuration? How many electrons do elements in groups 14 and 17 need to gain to achieve a stable\nconfiguration?\na.\nElements of group 1 need to lose one electron, elements of group 14 need to gain 4 electrons, and elements\nof group 17 need to gain 1 electron\nb.\nElements of group 1 need to lose 4 electrons while elements of group 14 and 17 need to gain 1 electron each.\nc.\nElements of group 1 need to lose 2 electrons, elements of group 14 need to gain 4 electrons and elements of\ngroup 17 need to gain 1 electron.\nd.\nElements of group 1 need to gain 1 electron while, elements of group 14 need to lose 4 electrons and elements\nof group 17 need to lose 1 electron.\nUnderstanding that the organization of the periodic table is based on the total number of protons (and electrons) helps us\nknow how electrons are distributed among the shells. The periodic table is arranged in columns and rows based on the\nnumber of electrons and where these electrons are located. Take a closer look at the some of the elements in the table\u2019s far\nright column in the periodic table. The group 18 atoms helium (He), neon (Ne), and argon (Ar) all have filled outer electron\nshells, making it unnecessary for them to share electrons with other atoms to attain stability; they are highly stable as single\natoms. Their non-reactivity has resulted in their being named the inert gases (or noble gases). Compare this to the group\n1 elements in the left-hand column. These elements, including hydrogen (H), lithium (Li), and sodium (Na), all have one\nelectron in their outermost shells. That means that they can achieve a stable configuration and a filled outer shell by donating\nor sharing one electron with another atom or a molecule such as water. Hydrogen will donate or share its electron to achieve\nthis configuration, while lithium and sodium will donate their electron to become stable. As a result of losing a negatively\ncharged electron, they become positively charged ions. Group 17 elements, including fluorine and chlorine, have seven\nelectrons in their outmost shells, so they tend to fill this shell with an electron from other atoms or molecules, making them\nnegatively charged ions. Group 14 elements, of which carbon is the most important to living systems, have four electrons\nin their outer shell allowing them to make several covalent bonds (discussed below) with other atoms. Thus, the columns\nof the periodic table represent the potential shared state of these elements\u2019 outer electron shells that is responsible for their\nsimilar chemical characteristics.\nElectron Orbitals\nAlthough useful to explain the reactivity and chemical bonding of certain elements, the Bohr model of the atom does\nnot accurately reflect how electrons are spatially distributed surrounding the nucleus. They do not circle the nucleus like\nthe earth orbits the sun, but are found in electron orbitals. These relatively complex shapes result from the fact that\nelectrons behave not just like particles, but also like waves. Mathematical equations from quantum mechanics known as\nwave functions can predict within a certain level of probability where an electron might be at any given time. The area\nwhere an electron is most likely to be found is called its orbital.\nRecall that the Bohr model depicts an atom\u2019s electron shell configuration. Within each electron shell are subshells, and\neach subshell has a specified number of orbitals containing electrons. While it is impossible to calculate exactly where an\nelectron is located, scientists know that it is most probably located within its orbital path. Subshells are designated by the\nletter s, p, d, and f. The s subshell is spherical in shape and has one orbital. Principal shell 1n has only a single s orbital,\nwhich can hold two electrons. Principal shell 2n has one s and one p subshell, and can hold a total of eight electrons. The\np subshell has three dumbbell-shaped orbitals, as illustrated in Figure 2.8. Subshells d and f have more complex shapes\nand contain five and seven orbitals, respectively. These are not shown in the illustration. Principal shell 3n has s, p, and d\nsubshells and can hold 18 electrons. Principal shell 4n has s, p, d and f orbitals and can hold 32 electrons. Moving away\nfrom the nucleus, the number of electrons and orbitals found in the energy levels increases. Progressing from one atom to\nthe next in the periodic table, the electron structure can be worked out by fitting an extra electron into the next available\norbital.\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\n51\nFigure 2.8 The s subshells are shaped like spheres. Both the 1n and 2n principal shells have an s orbital, but the size\nof the sphere is larger in the 2n orbital. Each sphere is a single orbital. p subshells are made up of three dumbbell-\nshaped orbitals. Principal shell 2n has a p subshell, but shell 1 does not.\nThe closest orbital to the nucleus, called the 1s orbital, can hold up to two electrons. This orbital is equivalent to the\ninnermost electron shell of the Bohr model of the atom. It is called the 1s orbital because it is spherical around the nucleus.\nThe 1s orbital is the closest orbital to the nucleus, and it is always filled first, before any other orbital can be filled.\nHydrogen has one electron; therefore, it has only one spot within the 1s orbital occupied. This is designated as 1s1, where\nthe superscripted 1 refers to the one electron within the 1s orbital. Helium has two electrons; therefore, it can completely\nfill the 1s orbital with its two electrons. This is designated as 1s2, referring to the two electrons of helium in the 1s orbital.\nOn the periodic table Figure 2.5, hydrogen and helium are the only two elements in the first row (period); this is because\nthey only have electrons in their first shell, the 1s orbital. Hydrogen and helium are the only two elements that have the 1s\nand no other electron orbitals in the electrically neutral state.\nThe second electron shell may contain eight electrons. This shell contains another spherical s orbital and three \u201cdumbbell\u201d\nshaped p orbitals, each of which can hold two electrons, as shown in Figure 2.8. After the 1s orbital is filled, the second\nelectron shell is filled, first filling its 2s orbital and then its three p orbitals. When filling the p orbitals, each takes a single\nelectron; once each p orbital has an electron, a second may be added. Lithium (Li) contains three electrons that occupy\nthe first and second shells. Two electrons fill the 1s orbital, and the third electron then fills the 2s orbital. Its electron\nconfiguration is 1s22s1. Neon (Ne), on the other hand, has a total of ten electrons: two are in its innermost 1s orbital\nand eight fill its second shell (two each in the 2s and three p orbitals); thus, it is an inert gas and energetically stable as\na single atom that will rarely form a chemical bond with other atoms. Larger elements have additional orbitals, making\nup the third electron shell. While the concepts of electron shells and orbitals are closely related, orbitals provide a more\naccurate depiction of the electron configuration of an atom because the orbital model specifies the different shapes and\nspecial orientations of all the places that electrons may occupy.\n52\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nWatch this visual animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/orbitals) to see the spatial arrangement of the p and s orbitals.\nUse the periodic table to describe what a Bohr model of Fluorine (F) would look like and explain why the Bohr model\nis not an accurate representation of the electron orbitals in fluorine.\na.\nA Bohr model would have 2 electron rings, and a Bohr model would not give information about atomic mass\nb.\nA Bohr model would have one electron ring, and a Bohr model would not show the sub-shells of first ring\nc.\nA Bohr model would have 2 electron rings, and a Bohr model would not show the sub-shell of second ring\nd.\nA Bohr model would have one electron ring, and a Bohr model would not give information about number of\nelectron in each ring\nActivity\nCreate diagrams to show the placement of protons, neutrons, and electrons in an atom of carbon-12 and\ncarbon-14, respectably.

This is because\nit is energetically favorable for atoms to be in that configuration and it makes them stable. However, since not all elements\nhave enough electrons to fill their outermost shells, atoms form chemical bonds with other atoms thereby obtaining the\nelectrons they need to attain a stable electron configuration. When two or more atoms chemically bond with each other,\nthe resultant chemical structure is a molecule. The familiar water molecule, H2O, consists of two hydrogen atoms and\none oxygen atom; these bond together to form water, as illustrated in Figure 2.9. Atoms can form molecules by donating,\naccepting, or sharing electrons to fill their outer shells.\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\n53\nFigure 2.9 Two or more atoms may bond with each other to form a molecule. When two hydrogens and an oxygen\nshare electrons via covalent bonds, a water molecule is formed.\nChemical reactions occur when two or more atoms bond together to form molecules or when bonded atoms are broken\napart. The substances used in the beginning of a chemical reaction are called the reactants (usually found on the left side\nof a chemical equation), and the substances found at the end of the reaction are known as the products (usually found\non the right side of a chemical equation). An arrow is typically drawn between the reactants and products to indicate the\ndirection of the chemical reaction; this direction is not always a \u201cone-way street.\u201d For the creation of the water molecule\nshown above, the chemical equation would be:\n2H + O \u2192 H2 O\nAn example of a simple chemical reaction is the breaking down of hydrogen peroxide molecules, each of which consists\nof two hydrogen atoms bonded to two oxygen atoms (H2O2). The reactant hydrogen peroxide is broken down into water,\ncontaining one oxygen atom bound to two hydrogen atoms (H2O), and oxygen, which consists of two bonded oxygen atoms\n(O2). In the equation below, the reaction includes two hydrogen peroxide molecules and two water molecules. This is an\nexample of a balanced chemical equation, wherein the number of atoms of each element is the same on each side of the\nequation. According to the law of conservation of matter, the number of atoms before and after a chemical reaction should\nbe equal, such that no atoms are, under normal circumstances, created or destroyed.\n2H2 O2  (hydrogen peroxide) \u2192 2H2 O (water) + O2  (oxygen)\nEven though all of the reactants and products of this reaction are molecules (each atom remains bonded to at least one other\natom), in this reaction only hydrogen peroxide and water are representatives of compounds: they contain atoms of more\nthan one type of element. Molecular oxygen, on the other hand, as shown in Figure 2.10, consists of two doubly bonded\noxygen atoms and is not classified as a compound but as a homonuclear molecule.\nFigure 2.10 The oxygen atoms in an O2 molecule are joined by a double bond.\nSome chemical reactions, such as the one shown above, can proceed in one direction until the reactants are all used up.\nThe equations that describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and are irreversible. Reversible reactions are\nthose that can go in either direction. In reversible reactions, reactants are turned into products, but when the concentration of\nproduct goes beyond a certain threshold (characteristic of the particular reaction), some of these products will be converted\nback into reactants; at this point, the designations of products and reactants are reversed. This back and forth continues until\na certain relative balance between reactants and products occurs\u2014a state called equilibrium. These situations of reversible\nreactions are often denoted by a chemical equation with a double headed arrow pointing towards both the reactants and\nproducts.\nFor example, in human blood, excess hydrogen ions (H+) bind to bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) forming an equilibrium state\nwith carbonic acid (H2CO3). If carbonic acid were added to this system, some of it would be converted to bicarbonate and\n54\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nhydrogen ions.\nHCO\u2212+ H+ \u2014 H2 CO3\nIn biological reactions, however, equilibrium is rarely obtained because the concentrations of the reactants or products or\nboth are constantly changing, often with a product of one reaction being a reactant for another. To return to the example of\nexcess hydrogen ions in the blood, the formation of carbonic acid will be the major direction of the reaction. However, the\ncarbonic acid can also leave the body as carbon dioxide gas (via exhalation) instead of being converted back to bicarbonate\nion, thus driving the reaction to the right by the chemical law known as law of mass action. These reactions are important\nfor maintaining the homeostasis of our blood.\nHCO\u2212 + H+  \u2014  H2 CO3  \u2194 CO2  + H2 O\nIons and Ionic Bonds\nSome atoms are more stable when they gain or lose an electron (or possibly two) and form ions. This fills their outermost\nelectron shell and makes them energetically more stable. Because the number of electrons does not equal the number of\nprotons, each ion has a net charge. Cations are positive ions that are formed by losing electrons. Negative ions are formed\nby gaining electrons and are called anions. Anions are designated by their elemental name being altered to end in \u201c-ide\u201d:\nthe anion of chlorine is called chloride, and the anion of sulfur is called sulfide, for example.\nThis movement of electrons from one element to another is referred to as electron transfer. As Figure 2.11 illustrates,\nsodium (Na) only has one electron in its outer electron shell. It takes less energy for sodium to donate that one electron\nthan it does to accept seven more electrons to fill the outer shell. If sodium loses an electron, it now has 11 protons, 11\nneutrons, and only 10 electrons, leaving it with an overall charge of +1. It is now referred to as a sodium ion. Chlorine (Cl)\nin its lowest energy state (called the ground state) has seven electrons in its outer shell. Again, it is more energy-efficient\nfor chlorine to gain one electron than to lose seven. Therefore, it tends to gain an electron to create an ion with 17 protons,\n17 neutrons, and 18 electrons, giving it a net negative (\u20131) charge. It is now referred to as a chloride ion. In this example,\nsodium will donate its one electron to empty its shell, and chlorine will accept that electron to fill its shell. Both ions now\nsatisfy the octet rule and have complete outermost shells. Because the number of electrons is no longer equal to the number\nof protons, each is now an ion and has a +1 (sodium cation) or \u20131 (chloride anion) charge. Note that these transactions can\nnormally only take place simultaneously: in order for a sodium atom to lose an electron, it must be in the presence of a\nsuitable recipient like a chlorine atom.\nFigure 2.11 In the formation of an ionic compound, metals lose electrons and nonmetals gain electrons to achieve an\noctet.\nIonic bonds are formed between ions with opposite charges. For instance, positively charged sodium ions and negatively\ncharged chloride ions bond together to make crystals of sodium chloride, or table salt, creating a crystalline molecule with\nzero net charge.\nCertain salts are referred to in physiology as electrolytes (including sodium, potassium, and calcium), ions necessary for\nnerve impulse conduction, muscle contractions and water balance. Many sports drinks and dietary supplements provide\nthese ions to replace those lost from the body via sweating during exercise.\nCovalent Bonds and Other Bonds and Interactions\nAnother way the octet rule can be satisfied is by the sharing of electrons between atoms to form covalent bonds. These\nbonds are stronger and much more common than ionic bonds in the molecules of living organisms. Covalent bonds are\ncommonly found in carbon-based organic molecules, such as our DNA and proteins. Covalent bonds are also found in\ninorganic molecules like H2O, CO2, and O2. One, two, or three pairs of electrons may be shared, making single, double, and\ntriple bonds, respectively. The more covalent bonds between two atoms, the stronger their connection. Thus, triple bonds\nare the strongest.\nThe strength of different levels of covalent bonding is one of the main reasons living organisms have a difficult time in\nacquiring nitrogen for use in constructing their molecules, even though molecular nitrogen, N2, is the most abundant gas in\nthe atmosphere. Molecular nitrogen consists of two nitrogen atoms triple bonded to each other and, as with all molecules,\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\n55\nthe sharing of these three pairs of electrons between the two nitrogen atoms allows for the filling of their outer electron\nshells, making the molecule more stable than the individual nitrogen atoms. This strong triple bond makes it difficult for\nliving systems to break apart this nitrogen in order to use it as constituents of proteins and DNA.\nThe formation of water molecules provides an example of covalent bonding. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms that combine\nto form water molecules are bound together by covalent bonds, as shown in Figure 2.9. The electron from the hydrogen\nsplits its time between the incomplete outer shell of the hydrogen atoms and the incomplete outer shell of the oxygen atoms.\nTo completely fill the outer shell of oxygen, which has six electrons in its outer shell but which would be more stable with\neight, two electrons (one from each hydrogen atom) are needed: hence the well-known formula H2O. The electrons are\nshared between the two elements to fill the outer shell of each, making both elements more stable.\nView this short video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ionic_covalent) to see an animation of ionic and covalent bonding.\nWhat makes ionic bonds different from covalent bonds?\na.\nIonic bond involves the transfer of electrons whereas covalent bond involves the sharing of electrons.\nb.\nIonic bond involves the van der Waals force of interaction whereas covalent bond involves the sharing of\nelectrons.\nc.\nIonic bond involves the sharing of electrons whereas a covalent bond involves the transfer of electrons.\nd.\nAn ionic bond involves the transfer of electrons whereas a covalent bond involves the van der Waals force\nof interaction.\nPolar Covalent Bonds\nThere are two types of covalent bonds: polar and nonpolar. In a polar covalent bond, shown in this figure, the electrons\nare unequally shared by the atoms and are attracted more to one nucleus than the other. Because of the unequal distribution\nof electrons between the atoms of different elements, a slightly positive (\u03b4+) or slightly negative (\u03b4\u2013) charge develops. This\npartial charge is an important property of water and accounts for many of its characteristics.\nWater is a polar molecule, with the hydrogen atoms acquiring a partial positive charge and the oxygen a partial negative\ncharge. This occurs because the nucleus of the oxygen atom is more attractive to the electrons of the hydrogen atoms than\nthe hydrogen nucleus is to the oxygen\u2019s electrons. Thus oxygen has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen and the shared\nelectrons spend more time in the vicinity of the oxygen nucleus than they do near the nucleus of the hydrogen atoms, giving\nthe atoms of oxygen and hydrogen slightly negative and positive charges, respectively. Another way of stating this is that\nthe probability of finding a shared electron near an oxygen nucleus is more likely than finding it near a hydrogen nucleus.\nEither way, the atom\u2019s relative electronegativity contributes to the development of partial charges whenever one element is\nsignificantly more electronegative than the other, and the charges generated by these polar bonds may then be used for the\nformation of hydrogen bonds based on the attraction of opposite partial charges. (Hydrogen bonds, which are discussed in\ndetail below, are weak bonds between slightly positively charged hydrogen atoms to slightly negatively charged atoms in\nother molecules.) Since macromolecules often have atoms within them that differ in electronegativity, polar bonds are often\npresent in organic molecules.\nNonpolar Covalent Bonds\nNonpolar covalent bonds form between two atoms of the same element or between different elements that share electrons\nequally. For example, molecular oxygen (O2) is nonpolar because the electrons will be equally distributed between the two\noxygen atoms.\nAnother example of a nonpolar covalent bond is methane (CH4), also shown in this figure. Carbon has four electrons in its\noutermost shell and needs four more to fill it. It gets these four from four hydrogen atoms, each atom providing one, making\na stable outer shell of eight electrons. Carbon and hydrogen do not have the same electronegativity but are similar; thus,\n56\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nnonpolar bonds form. The hydrogen atoms each need one electron for their outermost shell, which is filled when it contains\ntwo electrons. These elements share the electrons equally among the carbons and the hydrogen atoms, creating a nonpolar\ncovalent molecule.\nFigure 2.12 Whether a molecule is polar or nonpolar depends both on bond type and molecular shape. Both water and\ncarbon dioxide have polar covalent bonds, but carbon dioxide is linear, so the partial charges on the molecule cancel\neach other out.\nHydrogen Bonds and Van Der Waals Interactions\nIonic and covalent bonds between elements require energy to break. Ionic bonds are not as strong as covalent, which\ndetermines their behavior in biological systems. However, not all bonds are ionic or covalent bonds. Weaker bonds can\nalso form between molecules. Two weak bonds that occur frequently are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions.\nWithout these two types of bonds, life as we know it would not exist. Hydrogen bonds provide many of the critical, life-\nsustaining properties of water and also stabilize the structures of proteins and DNA, the building block of cells.\nWhen polar covalent bonds containing hydrogen form, the hydrogen in that bond has a slightly positive charge because\nhydrogen\u2019s electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element and away from the hydrogen. Because the hydrogen is\nslightly positive, it will be attracted to neighboring negative charges. When this happens, a weak interaction occurs between\nthe \u03b4+of the hydrogen from one molecule and the \u03b4\u2013 charge on the more electronegative atoms of another molecule, usually\noxygen or nitrogen, or within the same molecule. This interaction is called a hydrogen bond. This type of bond is common\nand occurs regularly between water molecules. Individual hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken; however, they occur\nin very large numbers in water and in organic polymers, creating a major force in combination. Hydrogen bonds are also\nresponsible for zipping together the DNA double helix.\nLike hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions are weak attractions or interactions between molecules. Van der Waals\nattractions can occur between any two or more molecules and are dependent on slight fluctuations of the electron densities,\nwhich are not always symmetrical around an atom. For these attractions to happen, the molecules need to be very close to\none another. These bonds\u2014along with ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds\u2014contribute to the three-dimensional structure\nof the proteins in our cells that is necessary for their proper function.\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\n57\nPharmaceutical chemists are responsible for the development of new drugs and trying to determine the\nmode of action of both old and new drugs. They are involved in every step of the drug development process.\nDrugs can be found in the natural environment or can be synthesized in the laboratory. In many cases,\npotential drugs found in nature are changed chemically in the laboratory to make them safer and more\neffective, and sometimes synthetic versions of drugs substitute for the version found in nature.\nAfter the initial discovery or synthesis of a drug, the chemist then develops the drug, perhaps chemically\naltering it, testing it to see if the drug is toxic, and then designing methods for efficient large-scale production.\nThen, the process of getting the drug approved for human use begins. In the United States, drug approval is\nhandled by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and involves a series of large-scale experiments using\nhuman subjects to make sure the drug is not harmful and effectively treats the condition it aims to treat. This\nprocess often takes several years and requires the participation of physicians and scientists, in addition to\nchemists, to complete testing and gain approval.\nAn example of a drug that was originally discovered in a living organism is Paclitaxel, an anti-cancer drug.\nThis drug was discovered in the bark of the pacific yew tree. Another example is aspirin, originally isolated\nfrom willow tree bark. Finding drugs often means testing hundreds of samples of plants, fungi, and other\nforms of life to see if any biologically active compounds are found within them. Sometimes, traditional\nmedicine can give modern medicine clues to where an active compound can be found. For example, the\nuse of willow bark to make medicine has been known for thousands of years, dating back to ancient Egypt.\nIt was not until the late 1800s, however, that the aspirin molecule, known as acetylsalicylic acid, was purified\nand marketed for human use.\nOccasionally, drugs developed for one use are found to have unforeseen effects that allow these drugs to\nbe used in other, unrelated ways. For example, the drug minoxidil was originally developed to treat high\nblood pressure. When tested on humans, it was noticed that individuals taking the drug would grow new\nhair. Eventually the drug was marketed to men and women with baldness to restore lost hair.\nThe career of the pharmaceutical chemist may involve detective work, experimentation, and drug\ndevelopment, all with the goal of making human beings healthier.\n58\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nBonds Can Be Flexible\nProteins are mostly made up of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur.

        "summary": "All matter is composed of elements, substances that cannot be broken down by ordinary chemical reactions, each made of atoms containing protons, neutrons, and electrons. Atoms have characteristic numbers of protons (atomic number) and varying numbers of neutrons (isotopes), some of which are radioactive and can be used in dating materials. Electrons occupy orbitals within energy levels, with outer (valence) electrons determining chemical reactivity. Atoms achieve stability by filling their valence shells through gaining, losing, or sharing electrons, leading to ion formation (ionic bonds) or electron sharing (covalent bonds), which may be polar or nonpolar depending on electronegativity differences. Hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions are weaker forces that nonetheless play crucial roles in stabilizing biological molecules like proteins and DNA. Chemical reactions, which follow the law of conservation of matter, involve breaking and forming bonds to produce new substances, and may be reversible, reaching equilibrium. These principles underlie molecular structures and interactions essential to life, from the formation of water and biomolecules to the biochemical processes within living systems."

H2O (water) is an example of a polar molecule. Because oxygen is more\nelectronegative than hydrogen, the electrons are drawn toward oxygen and away from the hydrogen atoms; consequently,\nthe oxygen atom acquires a slight negative charge and each hydrogen atoms acquires a slightly positive charge. It is\nimportant to remember that the electrons are still shared, just not equally.\nWater\u2019s polarity allows for the formation of hydrogen bonds between adjacent water molecules, resulting in many unique\nproperties that are critical to maintaining life. For example, water is an excellent solvent because hydrogen bonds allow ions\nand other polar molecules to dissolve in water. Water\u2019s hydrogen bonds also contribute to its high heat capacity and high\nheat of vaporization, resulting in greater temperature stability. Hydrogen bond formation makes ice less dense as a solid than\nas a liquid, insulating aquatic environments. Water\u2019s cohesive and adhesive properties are seen as it rises inside capillary\ntubes or travels up a large tree from roots to leaves. The pH or hydrogen ion concentration of a solution is highly regulated\nto help organisms maintain homeostasis; for example, as will be explored in later chapters, the enzymes that catalyze most\nchemical reactions in cells are pH specific. Thus, the properties of water are connected to the biochemical and physical\nprocesses performed by living organisms. Life on Earth would be very different if these properties were altered\u2014if life\ncould exist at all.\nThe information presented and the examples highlighted in this section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined\nin Big Idea 2 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 2.8] [APLO 2.23]\nWhy do scientists spend time looking for water on other planets? Why is water so important? It is because water is essential\nto life as we know it. Water is one of the more abundant molecules and the one most critical to life on Earth. Approximately\n60\u201370 percent of the human body is made up of water. Without it, life as we know it simply would not exist.\nThe polarity of the water molecule and its resulting hydrogen bonding make water a unique substance with special\nproperties that are intimately tied to the processes of life. Life originally evolved in a watery environment, and most of an\norganism\u2019s cellular chemistry and metabolism occur inside the watery contents of the cell\u2019s cytoplasm. Special properties\nof water are its high heat capacity and heat of vaporization, its ability to dissolve polar molecules, its cohesive and adhesive\nproperties, and its dissociation into ions that leads to the generation of pH. Understanding these characteristics of water\nhelps to elucidate its importance in maintaining life.\nWater\u2019s Polarity\nOne of water\u2019s important properties is that it is composed of polar molecules: the hydrogen and oxygen within water\nmolecules (H2O) form polar covalent bonds. While there is no net charge to a water molecule, the polarity of water creates\na slightly positive charge on hydrogen and a slightly negative charge on oxygen, contributing to water\u2019s properties of\nattraction. Water\u2019s charges are generated because oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, making it more likely that\na shared electron would be found near the oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen nucleus, thus generating the partial negative\ncharge near the oxygen.\n60\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nAs a result of water\u2019s polarity, each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the opposite charges between\nwater molecules, forming hydrogen bonds. Water also attracts or is attracted to other polar molecules and ions. A polar\nsubstance that interacts readily with or dissolves in water is referred to as hydrophilic (hydro- = \u201cwater\u201d; -philic =\n\u201cloving\u201d). In contrast, non-polar molecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with water, as shown in Figure 2.14 and\nseparate from it rather than dissolve in it, as we see in salad dressings containing oil and vinegar (an acidic water solution).\nThese nonpolar compounds are called hydrophobic (hydro- = \u201cwater\u201d; -phobic = \u201cfearing\u201d).\nFigure 2.14 Oil and water do not mix. As this macro image of oil and water shows, oil does not dissolve in water but\nforms droplets instead. This is due to it being a nonpolar compound. (credit: Gautam Dogra).\nWater\u2019s States: Gas, Liquid, and Solid\nThe formation of hydrogen bonds is an important quality of the liquid water that is crucial to life as we know it. As water\nmolecules make hydrogen bonds with each other, water takes on some unique chemical characteristics compared to other\nliquids and, since living things have a high water content, understanding these chemical features is key to understanding life.\nIn liquid water, hydrogen bonds are constantly formed and broken as the water molecules slide past each other. The breaking\nof these bonds is caused by the motion (kinetic energy) of the water molecules due to the heat contained in the system.\nWhen the heat is raised as water is boiled, the higher kinetic energy of the water molecules causes the hydrogen bonds\nto break completely and allows water molecules to escape into the air as gas (steam or water vapor). On the other hand,\nwhen the temperature of water is reduced and water freezes, the water molecules form a crystalline structure maintained by\nhydrogen bonding (there is not enough energy to break the hydrogen bonds) that makes ice less dense than liquid water, a\nphenomenon not seen in the solidification of other liquids.\nWater\u2019s lower density in its solid form is due to the way hydrogen bonds are oriented as it freezes: the water molecules are\npushed farther apart compared to liquid water. With most other liquids, solidification when the temperature drops includes\nthe lowering of kinetic energy between molecules, allowing them to pack even more tightly than in liquid form and giving\nthe solid a greater density than the liquid.\nThe lower density of ice, illustrated and pictured in Figure 2.15, an anomaly, causes it to float at the surface of liquid water,\nsuch as in an iceberg or in the ice cubes in a glass of ice water. In lakes and ponds, ice will form on the surface of the\nwater creating an insulating barrier that protects the animals and plant life in the pond from freezing. Without this layer\nof insulating ice, plants and animals living in the pond would freeze in the solid block of ice and could not survive. The\ndetrimental effect of freezing on living organisms is caused by the expansion of ice relative to liquid water. The ice crystals\nthat form upon freezing rupture the delicate membranes essential for the function of living cells, irreversibly damaging\nthem. Cells can only survive freezing if the water in them is temporarily replaced by another liquid like glycerol.\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\n61\nFigure 2.15 Hydrogen bonding makes ice less dense than liquid water.

Specific heat is defined as the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose\nto change its temperature by one degree Celsius. For water, this amount is one calorie. It therefore takes water a long time\nto heat and long time to cool. In fact, the specific heat capacity of water is about five times more than that of sand. This\nexplains why the land cools faster than the sea. Due to its high heat capacity, water is used by warm blooded animals to\nmore evenly disperse heat in their bodies: it acts in a similar manner to a car\u2019s cooling system, transporting heat from warm\nplaces to cool places, causing the body to maintain a more even temperature.\nWater\u2019s Heat of Vaporization\nWater also has a high heat of vaporization, the amount of energy required to change one gram of a liquid substance to a\ngas. A considerable amount of heat energy (586 cal) is required to accomplish this change in water. This process occurs on\nthe surface of water. As liquid water heats up, hydrogen bonding makes it difficult to separate the liquid water molecules\nfrom each other, which is required for it to enter its gaseous phase (steam). As a result, water acts as a heat sink or heat\nreservoir and requires much more heat to boil than does a liquid such as ethanol, whose hydrogen bonding with other ethanol\nmolecules is weaker than water\u2019s hydrogen bonding. Eventually, as water reaches its boiling point of 100\u00b0 Celsius (212\u00b0\nFahrenheit), the heat is able to break the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules, and the kinetic energy (motion)\nbetween the water molecules allows them to escape from the liquid as a gas. Even when below its boiling point, water\u2019s\nindividual molecules acquire enough energy from other water molecules such that some surface water molecules can escape\nand vaporize: this process is known as evaporation.\nThe fact that hydrogen bonds need to be broken for water to evaporate means that a substantial amount of energy is used in\nthe process. As the water evaporates, energy is taken up by the process, cooling the environment where the evaporation is\ntaking place. In many living organisms, including in humans, the evaporation of sweat, which is 90 percent water, allows\nthe organism to cool so that homeostasis of body temperature can be maintained.\nWater\u2019s Solvent Properties\nSince water is a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charges, ions and polar molecules can readily\ndissolve in it. Therefore, water is referred to as a solvent, a substance capable of dissolving other polar molecules and ionic\ncompounds. The charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water, surrounding the particle\nwith water molecules. This is referred to as a sphere of hydration, or a hydration shell, as illustrated in Figure 2.16 and\nserves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water.\nWhen ionic compounds are added to water, the individual ions react with the polar regions of the water molecules and\ntheir ionic bonds are disrupted in the process of dissociation. Dissociation occurs when atoms or groups of atoms break off\nfrom molecules and form ions. Consider table salt (NaCl, or sodium chloride): when NaCl crystals are added to water, the\nmolecules of NaCl dissociate into Na+ and Cl\u2013 ions, and spheres of hydration form around the ions, illustrated in Figure\n2.16. The positively charged sodium ion is surrounded by the partially negative charge of the water molecule\u2019s oxygen. The\nnegatively charged chloride ion is surrounded by the partially positive charge of the hydrogen on the water molecule.\nFigure 2.16 When table salt (NaCl) is mixed in water, spheres of hydration are formed around the ions.\nWater\u2019s Cohesive and Adhesive Properties\nHave you ever filled a glass of water to the very top and then slowly added a few more drops? Before it overflows, the\nwater forms a dome-like shape above the rim of the glass. This water can stay above the glass because of the property of\ncohesion. In cohesion, water molecules are attracted to each other (because of hydrogen bonding), keeping the molecules\ntogether at the liquid-gas (water-air) interface, although there is no more room in the glass.\nCohesion allows for the development of surface tension, the capacity of a substance to withstand being ruptured when\nplaced under tension or stress. This is also why water forms droplets when placed on a dry surface rather than being flattened\nout by gravity. When a small scrap of paper is placed onto the droplet of water, the paper floats on top of the water droplet\neven though paper is denser (heavier) than the water. Cohesion and surface tension keep the hydrogen bonds of water\nmolecules intact and support the item floating on the top. It\u2019s even possible to \u201cfloat\u201d a needle on top of a glass of water if\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\n63\nit is placed gently without breaking the surface tension, as shown in Figure 2.17.\nFigure 2.17 The weight of the needle is pulling the surface downward; at the same time, the surface tension is pulling\nit up, suspending it on the surface of the water and keeping it from sinking. Notice the indentation in the water around\nthe needle. (credit: Cory Zanker)\nThese cohesive forces are related to water\u2019s property of adhesion, or the attraction between water molecules and other\nmolecules. This attraction is sometimes stronger than water\u2019s cohesive forces, especially when the water is exposed to\ncharged surfaces such as those found on the inside of thin glass tubes known as capillary tubes. Adhesion is observed when\nwater \u201cclimbs\u201d up the tube placed in a glass of water: notice that the water appears to be higher on the sides of the tube than\nin the middle. This is because the water molecules are attracted to the charged glass walls of the capillary more than they are\nto each other and therefore adhere to it. This type of adhesion is called capillary action, and is illustrated in Figure 2.18.\nFigure 2.18 Capillary action in a glass tube is caused by the adhesive forces exerted by the internal surface of\nthe glass exceeding the cohesive forces between the water molecules themselves. (credit: modification of work by\nPearson-Scott Foresman, donated to the Wikimedia Foundation)\nWhy are cohesive and adhesive forces important for life? Cohesive and adhesive forces are important for the transport of\nwater from the roots to the leaves in plants. These forces create a \u201cpull\u201d on the water column. This pull results from the\ntendency of water molecules being evaporated on the surface of the plant to stay connected to water molecules below them,\nand so they are pulled along. Plants use this natural phenomenon to help transport water from their roots to their leaves.\nWithout these properties of water, plants would be unable to receive the water and the dissolved minerals they require. In\nanother example, insects such as the water strider, shown in Figure 2.19, use the surface tension of water to stay afloat on\nthe surface layer of water and even mate there.\n64\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 2.19 Water\u2019s cohesive and adhesive properties allow this water strider (Gerris sp.) to stay afloat.

California redwood tree.\nWhat other unique properties of water are attributed to its molecular structure, and how are these properties\nimportant to life?\npH, Buffers, Acids, and Bases\nThe pH of a solution indicates its acidity or alkalinity.\nH2 O(l) \u2194H+(aq) + OH-(aq)\nlitmus or pH paper, filter paper that has been treated with a natural water-soluble dye so it can be used as a pH indicator,\nto test how much acid (acidity) or base (alkalinity) exists in a solution. You might have even used some to test whether the\nwater in a swimming pool is properly treated. In both cases, the pH test measures the concentration of hydrogen ions in a\ngiven solution.\nHydrogen ions are spontaneously generated in pure water by the dissociation (ionization) of a small percentage of water\nmolecules into equal numbers of hydrogen (H+) ions and hydroxide (OH-) ions. While the hydroxide ions are kept in\nsolution by their hydrogen bonding with other water molecules, the hydrogen ions, consisting of naked protons, are\nimmediately attracted to un-ionized water molecules, forming hydronium ions (H30+). Still, by convention, scientists refer\nto hydrogen ions and their concentration as if they were free in this state in liquid water.\nThe concentration of hydrogen ions dissociating from pure water is 1 \u00d7 10-7 moles H+ ions per liter of water. Moles (mol)\nare a way to express the amount of a substance (which can be atoms, molecules, ions, etc), with one mole being equal\nto 6.02 \u00d7 1023 particles of the substance. Therefore, 1 mole of water is equal to 6.02 \u00d7 1023 water molecules. The pH is\ncalculated as the negative of the base 10 logarithm of this concentration. The log10 of 1 \u00d7 10-7 is -7.0, and the negative of\nthis number (indicated by the \u201cp\u201d of \u201cpH\u201d) yields a pH of 7.0, which is also known as neutral pH. The pH inside of human\ncells and blood are examples of two areas of the body where near-neutral pH is maintained.\nNon-neutral pH readings result from dissolving acids or bases in water. Using the negative logarithm to generate positive\nintegers, high concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low pH number, whereas low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high\npH. An acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution, usually by having one of\nits hydrogen atoms dissociate. A base provides either hydroxide ions (OH\u2013) or other negatively charged ions that combine\nwith hydrogen ions, reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the pH. In cases where the base releases\nhydroxide ions, these ions bind to free hydrogen ions, generating new water molecules.\nThe stronger the acid, the more readily it donates H+. For example, hydrochloric acid (HCl) completely dissociates into\nhydrogen and chloride ions and is highly acidic, whereas the acids in tomato juice or vinegar do not completely dissociate\nand are considered weak acids. Conversely, strong bases are those substances that readily donate OH\u2013 or take up hydrogen\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\n65\nions. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and many household cleaners are highly alkaline and give up OH\u2013 rapidly when placed in\nwater, thereby raising the pH. An example of a weak basic solution is seawater, which has a pH near 8.0, close enough to\nneutral pH that marine organisms adapted to this saline environment are able to thrive in it.\nThe pH scale is, as previously mentioned, an inverse logarithm and ranges from 0 to 14 (Figure 2.20). Anything below 7.0\n(ranging from 0.0 to 6.9) is acidic, and anything above 7.0 (from 7.1 to 14.0) is alkaline. Extremes in pH in either direction\nfrom 7.0 are usually considered inhospitable to life. The pH inside cells (6.8) and the pH in the blood (7.4) are both very\nclose to neutral. However, the environment in the stomach is highly acidic, with a pH of 1 to 2. So how do the cells of the\nstomach survive in such an acidic environment? How do they homeostatically maintain the near neutral pH inside them?\nThe answer is that they cannot do it and are constantly dying. New stomach cells are constantly produced to replace dead\nones, which are digested by the stomach acids. It is estimated that the lining of the human stomach is completely replaced\nevery seven to ten days.\nFigure 2.20 The pH scale measures the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution. (credit: modification of work\nby Edward Stevens)\nWatch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/pH_scale) for a straightforward explanation of pH and its logarithmic\nscale.\nOne of the risks for people with diabetes is diabetic ketoacidosis, a build-up of acid in the blood stream. Explain why\nthis is dangerous to humans.\na.\nDiabetic ketoacidosis decreases the normal pH (8.35-8.45) to a lower value.\nb.\nDiabetic ketoacidosis increases normal pH level of blood disrupting biological processes.\nc.\nDiabetic ketoacidosis keeps pH level of blood constant which disrupts biological processes.\nd.\nDiabetic ketoacidosis decreases normal pH (7.35-7.45) to a lower value.\n66\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nSo how can organisms whose bodies require a near-neutral pH ingest acidic and basic substances (a human drinking orange\njuice, for example) and survive? Buffers are the key. Buffers readily absorb excess H+ or OH\u2013, keeping the pH of the body\ncarefully maintained in the narrow range required for survival. Maintaining a constant blood pH is critical to a person\u2019s\nwell-being. The buffer maintaining the pH of human blood involves carbonic acid (H2CO3), bicarbonate ion (HCO3\u2013), and\ncarbon dioxide (CO2). When bicarbonate ions combine with free hydrogen ions and become carbonic acid, hydrogen ions\nare removed, moderating pH changes. Similarly, as shown in Figure 2.21, excess carbonic acid can be converted to carbon\ndioxide gas and exhaled through the lungs. This prevents too many free hydrogen ions from building up in the blood and\ndangerously reducing the blood\u2019s pH. Likewise, if too much OH\u2013 is introduced into the system, carbonic acid will combine\nwith it to create bicarbonate, lowering the pH. Without this buffer system, the body\u2019s pH would fluctuate enough to put\nsurvival in jeopardy.\nFigure 2.21 This diagram shows the body\u2019s buffering of blood pH levels. The blue arrows show the process of raising\npH as more CO2 is made. The purple arrows indicate the reverse process: the lowering of pH as more bicarbonate is\ncreated.\nOther examples of buffers are antacids used to combat excess stomach acid. Many of these over-the-counter medications\nwork in the same way as blood buffers, usually with at least one ion capable of absorbing hydrogen and moderating pH,\nbringing relief to those that suffer \u201cheartburn\u201d after eating. The unique properties of water that contribute to this capacity to\nbalance pH\u2014as well as water\u2019s other characteristics\u2014are essential to sustaining life on Earth.\nTo learn more about water.

        "summary": "Water is a polar molecule in which oxygen\u2019s higher electronegativity creates partial negative and positive charges, enabling hydrogen bonding that gives rise to its unique life-sustaining properties. These include high heat capacity and heat of vaporization, which stabilize temperature; lower density as ice, allowing it to float and insulate aquatic life; strong solvent abilities for polar and ionic substances via hydration shells; and cohesive and adhesive forces essential for processes like plant water transport and surface tension. Water naturally exists in gas, liquid, and solid states with behavior shaped by hydrogen bonding. Its dissociation into ions establishes pH, with acids increasing hydrogen ions and bases decreasing them, while buffers, like the carbonic acid\u2013bicarbonate system, maintain pH homeostasis critical for survival. These properties are indispensable to the chemistry of life, influencing cellular environments, climate moderation, nutrient transport, and biological processes."

Functional groups, such as \u2013CH3 (methyl) and \u2013COOH\n(carboxyl), are groups of atoms that give specific properties to hydrocarbon chains or rings that define their overall chemical\ncharacteristics and function. For example, the attachment of a carboxyl group (-COOH) makes a molecule more acidic,\nwhereas the presence of an amine group (NH2) makes a molecule more basic. (As we will explore in the next chapter, amino\nacids have both a carboxyl group and an amine group.)

The macromolecules are a subset of organic molecules (any carbon-containing liquid, solid,\nor gas) that are especially important for life. The fundamental component for all of these macromolecules is carbon. The\ncarbon atom has unique properties that allow it to form covalent bonds to as many as four different atoms, making this\nversatile element ideal to serve as the basic structural component, or \u201cbackbone,\u201d of the macromolecules.\nIndividual carbon atoms have an incomplete outermost electron shell. With an atomic number of 6 (six electrons and six\nprotons), the first two electrons fill the inner shell, leaving four in the second shell. Therefore, carbon atoms can form up\nto four covalent bonds with other atoms to satisfy the octet rule. The methane molecule provides an example: it has the\nchemical formula CH4. Each of its four hydrogen atoms forms a single covalent bond with the carbon atom by sharing a\npair of electrons. This results in a filled outermost shell.\nHydrocarbons\nHydrocarbons are organic molecules consisting entirely of carbon and hydrogen, such as methane (CH4) described above.\nWe often use hydrocarbons in our daily lives as fuels\u2014like the propane in a gas grill or the butane in a lighter. The many\ncovalent bonds between the atoms in hydrocarbons store a great amount of energy, which is released when these molecules\nare burned (oxidized). Methane, an excellent fuel, is the simplest hydrocarbon molecule, with a central carbon atom bonded\nto four different hydrogen atoms, as illustrated in Figure 2.23. The geometry of the methane molecule, where the atoms\nreside in three dimensions, is determined by the shape of its electron orbitals. The carbons and the four hydrogen atoms\nform a shape known as a tetrahedron, with four triangular faces; for this reason, methane is described as having tetrahedral\ngeometry.\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\n69\nFigure 2.23 Methane has a tetrahedral geometry, with each of the four hydrogen atoms spaced 109.5\u00b0 apart.\nAs the backbone of the large molecules of living things, hydrocarbons may exist as linear carbon chains, carbon rings, or\ncombinations of both. Furthermore, individual carbon-to-carbon bonds may be single, double, or triple covalent bonds, and\neach type of bond affects the geometry of the molecule in a specific way. This three-dimensional shape or conformation of\nthe large molecules of life (macromolecules) is critical to how they function.\nHydrocarbon Chains\nHydrocarbon chains are formed by successive bonds between carbon atoms and may be branched or unbranched.\nFurthermore, the overall geometry of the molecule is altered by the different geometries of single, double, and triple\ncovalent bonds, illustrated in Figure 2.24. The hydrocarbons ethane, ethene, and ethyne serve as examples of how different\ncarbon-to-carbon bonds affect the geometry of the molecule. The names of all three molecules start with the prefix \u201ceth-,\u201d\nwhich is the prefix for two carbon hydrocarbons. The suffixes \u201c-ane,\u201d \u201c-ene,\u201d and \u201c-yne\u201d refer to the presence of single,\ndouble, or triple carbon-carbon bonds, respectively. Thus, propane, propene, and propyne follow the same pattern with three\ncarbon molecules, butane, butene, and butyne for four carbon molecules, and so on. Double and triple bonds change the\ngeometry of the molecule: single bonds allow rotation along the axis of the bond, whereas double bonds lead to a planar\nconfiguration and triple bonds to a linear one. These geometries have a significant impact on the shape a particular molecule\ncan assume.\nFigure 2.24 When carbon forms single bonds with other atoms, the shape is tetrahedral. When two carbon atoms form\na double bond, the shape is planar, or flat. Single bonds, like those found in ethane, are able to rotate. Double bonds,\nlike those found in ethene cannot rotate, so the atoms on either side are locked in place.\nHydrocarbon Rings\nSo far, the hydrocarbons we have discussed have been aliphatic hydrocarbons, which consist of linear chains of carbon\natoms. Another type of hydrocarbon, aromatic hydrocarbons, consists of closed rings of carbon atoms. Ring structures\nare found in hydrocarbons, sometimes with the presence of double bonds, which can be seen by comparing the structure of\ncyclohexane to benzene in Figure 2.25. Examples of biological molecules that incorporate the benzene ring include some\namino acids and cholesterol and its derivatives, including the hormones estrogen and testosterone. The benzene ring is also\nfound in the herbicide 2,4-D. Benzene is a natural component of crude oil and has been classified as a carcinogen. Some\nhydrocarbons have both aliphatic and aromatic portions; beta-carotene is an example of such a hydrocarbon.\n70\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 2.25 Carbon can form five-and six membered rings. Single or double bonds may connect the carbons in the\nring, and nitrogen may be substituted for carbon.\nIsomers\nThe three-dimensional placement of atoms and chemical bonds within organic molecules is central to understanding their\nchemistry. Molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the placement (structure) of their atoms and/\nor chemical bonds are known as isomers. Structural isomers (like butane and isobutene shown in figurea) differ in\nthe placement of their covalent bonds: both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens (C4H10), but the different\narrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties. For example, due to their\ndifferent chemical properties, butane is suited for use as a fuel for torches, whereas isobutene is suited for use as a refrigerant\nand a propellant in spray cans.\nGeometric isomers, on the other hand, have similar placements of their covalent bonds but differ in how these bonds are\nmade to the surrounding atoms, especially in carbon-to-carbon double bonds. In the simple molecule butene (C4H8), the\ntwo methyl groups (CH3) can be on either side of the double covalent bond central to the molecule, as illustrated in figureb.\nWhen the carbons are bound on the same side of the double bond, this is the cis configuration; if they are on opposite sides\nof the double bond, it is a trans configuration. In the trans configuration, the carbons form a more or less linear structure,\nwhereas the carbons in the cis configuration make a bend (change in direction) of the carbon backbone.\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\n71\nFigure 2.26 Molecules that have the same number and type of atoms arranged differently are called isomers.\n(a) Structural isomers have a different covalent arrangement of atoms. (b) Geometric isomers have a different\narrangement of atoms around a double bond. (c) Enantiomers are mirror images of each other.\nWhich of the following statements is false?\na.\nMolecules with the formulas CH3 CH2 COOH and C3 H6 O2 could be structural isomers.\nb.\nMolecules must have a double bond to be cis-trans isomers.\nc.\nTo be enantiomers, a molecule must have at least three different atoms or groups connected to a central\ncarbon.\nd.\nTo be enantiomers, a molecule must have at least four different atoms or groups connected to a central\ncarbon.\nIn triglycerides (fats and oils), long carbon chains known as fatty acids may contain double bonds, which can be in either\nthe cis or trans configuration, illustrated in Figure 2.27. Fats with at least one double bond between carbon atoms are\nunsaturated fats. When some of these bonds are in the cis configuration, the resulting bend in the carbon backbone of the\nchain means that triglyceride molecules cannot pack tightly, so they remain liquid (oil) at room temperature. On the other\n72\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nhand, triglycerides with trans double bonds (popularly called trans fats), have relatively linear fatty acids that are able to\npack tightly together at room temperature and form solid fats. In the human diet, trans fats are linked to an increased risk\nof cardiovascular disease, so many food manufacturers have reduced or eliminated their use in recent years. In contrast\nto unsaturated fats, triglycerides without double bonds between carbon atoms are called saturated fats, meaning that they\ncontain all the hydrogen atoms available. Saturated fats are a solid at room temperature and usually of animal origin.\nFigure 2.27 These space-filling models show a cis (oleic acid) and a trans (eliadic acid) fatty acid. Notice the bend in\nthe molecule caused by the cis configuration.\nEnantiomers\nEnantiomers are molecules that share the same chemical structure and chemical bonds but differ in the three-dimensional\nplacement of atoms so that they are mirror images. As shown in Figure 2.28, an amino acid alanine example, the two\nstructures are non-superimposable. In nature, only the L-forms of amino acids are used to make proteins. Some D forms of\namino acids are seen in the cell walls of bacteria, but never in their proteins. Similarly, the D-form of glucose is the main\nproduct of photosynthesis and the L-form of the molecule is rarely seen in nature.\nFigure 2.28 D-alanine and L-alanine are examples of enantiomers or mirror images. Only the L-forms of amino acids\nare used to make proteins.\nFunctional Groups\nFunctional groups are groups of atoms that occur within molecules and confer specific chemical properties to those\nmolecules. They are found along the \u201ccarbon backbone\u201d of macromolecules. This carbon backbone is formed by chains\nand/or rings of carbon atoms with the occasional substitution of an element such as nitrogen or oxygen. Molecules with\nother elements in their carbon backbone are substituted hydrocarbons.\nThe functional groups in a macromolecule are usually attached to the carbon backbone at one or more different places\nalong its chain and/or ring structure. Each of the four types of macromolecules\u2014proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic\nacids\u2014has its own characteristic set of functional groups that contributes greatly to its differing chemical properties and its\nfunction in living organisms.\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\n73\nA functional group can participate in specific chemical reactions. Some of the important functional groups in biological\nmolecules are shown in Figure 2.29; they include: hydroxyl, methyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, amino, phosphate, and sulfhydryl.\nThese groups play an important role in the formation of molecules like DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Functional\ngroups are usually classified as hydrophobic or hydrophilic depending on their charge or polarity characteristics. An\nexample of a hydrophobic group is the non-polar methyl molecule. Among the hydrophilic functional groups is the carboxyl\ngroup found in amino acids, some amino acid side chains, and the fatty acids that form triglycerides and phospholipids.\nThis carboxyl group ionizes to release hydrogen ions (H+) from the COOH group resulting in the negatively charged COO-\ngroup; this contributes to the hydrophilic nature of whatever molecule it is found on. Other functional groups, such as the\ncarbonyl group, have a partially negatively charged oxygen atom that may form hydrogen bonds with water molecules,\nagain making the molecule more hydrophilic.\nFigure 2.29 The functional groups shown here are found in many different biological molecules.\nHydrogen bonds between functional groups (within the same molecule or between different molecules) are important to the\nfunction of many macromolecules and help them to fold properly into and maintain the appropriate shape for functioning.\nHydrogen bonds are also involved in various recognition processes, such as DNA complementary base pairing and the\nbinding of an enzyme to its substrate, as illustrated in Figure 2.30.\n74\nChapter 2 | The Chemical Foundation of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 2.30 Hydrogen bonds connect two strands of DNA together to create the double-helix structure.\nActivity\nCarbon forms the backbone of important biological molecules.

        "summary": "Carbon is the fundamental component of all biological macromolecules\u2014proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids\u2014due to its unique ability to form up to four covalent bonds with other atoms, creating diverse structures such as hydrocarbon chains and rings. These hydrocarbons can be aliphatic (linear) or aromatic (ringed) and may include single, double, or triple bonds, which influence their geometry and function. Carbon-based molecules can exist as isomers\u2014structural, geometric (cis/trans), or enantiomers\u2014with the same molecular formula but different arrangements, leading to distinct properties. Functional groups, such as hydroxyl, methyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, amino, phosphate, and sulfhydryl, attach to carbon backbones and confer specific chemical characteristics, influencing whether a molecule is hydrophobic or hydrophilic and enabling particular chemical reactions. These structural variations and chemical properties make carbon essential for forming the complex, three-dimensional, and functionally diverse molecules that support life."

(credit: modification\nof work by Bengt Nyman)\nChapter Outline\n3.1: Synthesis of Biological Macromolecules\n3.2: Carbohydrates\n3.3: Lipids\n3.4: Proteins\n3.5: Nucleic Acids\nIntroduction\nFood provides the body with the nutrients it needs to survive. Many of these critical nutrients are biological\nmacromolecules, or large molecules, necessary for and built by living things. For example, the amino acids found in protein\nare needed to build healthy bone and muscle. The body uses fat molecules to build new cells, store energy, and for proper\ndigestion. Carbohydrates are the primary source of the body\u2019s energy. Nucleic acids contain genetic information.\nWhile all living things, including humans, need macromolecules in their daily diet, an imbalance of any one of them can\nlead to health problems. For example, eating too much fat can lead to cardiovascular problems, and too much protein can\nlead to problems with the kidneys. Some people think that removing whole grains, such as wheat, from one\u2019s diet can be\nbeneficial. However, scientists have found that to not be true for the majority of people. In fact, just the opposite may be\ntrue, because whole wheat contains more dietary fiber than other types of grains. The full research review can be found here\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32wholegrain) .\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\n87\n3.1 | Synthesis of Biological Macromolecules\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow are complex macromolecule polymers synthesized from monomers?\n\u2022\nWhat is the difference between dehydration (or condensation) and hydrolysis reactions?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nLiving organisms need food to survive as it contains critical nutrients in the form of biological macromolecules. These\nlarge molecules are composed mainly of six elements\u2014sulfur, phosphorus, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen\n(SPONCH)\u2014in different quantities and arrangements. Complex polymers are built from combinations of smaller monomers\nby dehydration synthesis, a chemical reaction in which a molecule of water is removed between two linking monomers.\n(Think of a train: each boxcar, including the caboose, represents a monomer, and the entire train is a polymer.) During\ndigestion, polymers can be broken down by hydrolysis, or the addition of water. Both dehydration and hydrolysis reactions\nin cells are catalyzed by specific enzymes. Dehydration reactions typically require an investment of energy for new bond\nformation, whereas hydrolysis reactions typically release energy that can be used to power cellular processes. The four\ncategories of macromolecules are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Evidence supports scientists\u2019 claim that\nthe organic precursors of these biological molecules were present on primitive Earth.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined in Big\nIdea 1 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework. The Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide\na transparent foundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and\nAP\u00ae Exam questions.

There are four major classes of biological macromolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids);\neach is an important cell component and performs a wide array of functions. Combined, these molecules make up the\nmajority of a cell\u2019s dry mass (recall that water makes up the majority of its complete mass). Biological macromolecules\nare organic, meaning they contain carbon. In addition, they may contain hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and additional minor\nelements.\nMost macromolecules are made from single subunits, or building blocks, called monomers. The monomers combine with\neach other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers. In doing so, monomers release water\n88\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nmolecules as byproducts. This type of reaction is known as dehydration synthesis, which means \u201cto put together while\nlosing water.\u201d\nFigure 3.2 In the dehydration synthesis reaction depicted above, two molecules of glucose are linked together to form\nthe disaccharide maltose. In the process, a water molecule is formed.\nIn a dehydration synthesis reaction (Figure 3.2), the hydrogen of one monomer combines with the hydroxyl group of\nanother monomer, releasing a molecule of water. At the same time, the monomers share electrons and form covalent bonds.\nAs additional monomers join, this chain of repeating monomers forms a polymer. Different types of monomers can combine\nin many configurations, giving rise to a diverse group of macromolecules. Even one kind of monomer can combine in a\nvariety of ways to form several different polymers: for example, glucose monomers are the constituents of starch, glycogen,\nand cellulose.\nHydrolysis\nPolymers are broken down into monomers in a process known as hydrolysis, which means \u201cto split with water.\u201d Hydrolysis\nis a reaction in which a water molecule is used during the breakdown of another compound (Figure 3.3). During these\nreactions, the polymer is broken into two components: one part gains a hydrogen atom (H+) and the other gains a hydroxyl\nmolecule (OH\u2013) from a split water molecule.\nFigure 3.3 In the hydrolysis reaction shown here, the disaccharide maltose is broken down to form two glucose\nmonomers with the addition of a water molecule. Note that this reaction is the reverse of the synthesis reaction shown\nin Figure 3.2.\nDehydration and hydrolysis reactions are catalyzed, or \u201csped up,\u201d by specific enzymes; dehydration reactions involve\nthe formation of new bonds, requiring energy, while hydrolysis reactions break bonds and release energy. These reactions\nare similar for most macromolecules, but each monomer and polymer reaction is specific for its class. For example, in\nour bodies, food is hydrolyzed, or broken down, into smaller molecules by catalytic enzymes in the digestive system.\nThis allows for easy absorption of nutrients by cells in the intestine. Each macromolecule is broken down by a specific\nenzyme. For instance, carbohydrates are broken down by amylase, sucrase, lactase, or maltase. Proteins are broken down\nby the enzymes pepsin and peptidase, and by hydrochloric acid. Lipids are broken down by lipases. Breakdown of these\nmacromolecules provides energy for cellular activities.\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\n89\nVisit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/hydrolysis) to see visual representations of dehydration synthesis and\nhydrolysis.\nWhat role do electrons play in dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis?\na.\nSharing of electrons between monomers occurs in both dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis.\nb.\nThe sharing of electrons between monomers occurs in hydrolysis only.\nc.\nH+ and OH\u2212ions share electrons with the respective monomers in dehydration synthesis.\nd.\nH+ and OH\u2212ions share electrons with the respective monomers in hydrolysis.\n90\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nRecreating Primordial Earth\nMany people wonder how life formed on Earth. In 1953, Stanley Miller and Harold Urey developed\nan apparatus like the one shown in Figure 3.4 to model early conditions on earth. They wanted to\ntest if organic molecules could form from inorganic precursors believed to exist very early in Earth\u2019s\nhistory. They used boiling water to mimic early Earth\u2019s oceans. Steam from the \u201cocean\u201d combined\nwith methane, ammonia, and hydrogen gases from the early Earth\u2019s atmosphere and was exposed to\nelectrical sparks to act as lightning. As the gas mixture cooled and condensed, it was found to contain\norganic compounds, such as amino acids and nucleotides. According to the abiogenesis theory, these\norganic molecules came together to form the earliest form of life about 3.5 billion years ago. (credit:\nYassine Mrabet)\nFigure 3.4\nThink About It\nHow does Stanley Miller\u2019s and Harold Urey\u2019s model support the claim that organic precursors present\non early Earth could have assembled into large, complex molecules necessary for life?

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 4.15] [APLO 2.5]\nMolecular Structures\nMost people are familiar with carbohydrates, one type of macromolecule, especially when it comes to what we eat. To lose\nweight, some individuals adhere to \u201clow-carb\u201d diets. Athletes, in contrast, often \u201ccarb-load\u201d before important competitions\nto ensure that they have enough energy to compete at a high level. Carbohydrates are, in fact, an essential part of our diet;\ngrains, fruits, and vegetables are all natural sources of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates provide energy to the body, particularly\nthrough glucose, a simple sugar that is a component of starch and an ingredient in many staple foods. Carbohydrates also\nhave other important functions in humans, animals, and plants.\nCarbohydrates can be represented by the stoichiometric formula (CH2O)n, where n is the number of carbons in the\nmolecule. In other words, the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 1:2:1 in carbohydrate molecules. This formula also\nexplains the origin of the term \u201ccarbohydrate\u201d: the components are carbon (\u201ccarbo\u201d) and the components of water (hence,\n\u201chydrate\u201d). Carbohydrates are classified into three subtypes: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.\nMonosaccharides\nMonosaccharides (mono- = \u201cone\u201d; sacchar- = \u201csweet\u201d) are simple sugars, the most common of which is glucose. In\nmonosaccharides, the number of carbons usually ranges from three to seven. Most monosaccharide names end with the\nsuffix -ose. If the sugar has an aldehyde group (the functional group with the structure R-CHO), it is known as an aldose,\nand if it has a ketone group (the functional group with the structure RC(=O)R'), it is known as a ketose. Depending on the\nnumber of carbons in the sugar, they also may be known as trioses (three carbons), pentoses (five carbons), and or hexoses\n(six carbons). See Figure 3.5 for an illustration of the monosaccharides.\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\n93\nFigure 3.5 Monosaccharides are classified based on the position of their carbonyl group and the number of carbons\nin the backbone. Aldoses have a carbonyl group (indicated in green) at the end of the carbon chain, and ketoses have\na carbonyl group in the middle of the carbon chain. Trioses, pentoses, and hexoses have three-, five-, and six-carbon\nbackbones, respectively.\nThe chemical formula for glucose is C6H12O6. In humans, glucose is an important source of energy. During cellular\nrespiration, energy is released from glucose, and that energy is used to help make adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Plants\nsynthesize glucose using carbon dioxide and water, and glucose in turn is used for energy requirements for the plant. Excess\nglucose is often stored as starch that is catabolized (the breakdown of larger molecules by cells) by humans and other\nanimals that feed on plants.\nGalactose (part of lactose, or milk sugar) and fructose (found in sucrose, in fruit) are other common monosaccharides.\nAlthough glucose, galactose, and fructose all have the same chemical formula (C6H12O6), they differ structurally and\nchemically (and are known as isomers) because of the different arrangement of functional groups around the asymmetric\ncarbon; all of these monosaccharides have more than one asymmetric carbon (Figure 3.6).\n94\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 3.6 Glucose, galactose, and fructose are all hexoses. They are structural isomers, meaning they have the\nsame chemical formula (C6H12O6) but a different arrangement of atoms.\nIdentify each sugar as an aldose or ketose.\n1.\nfructose\n2.\ngalactose\n3.\nglucose\na.\nGlucose and galactose are aldoses. Fructose is a ketose\nb.\nGlucose and fructose are aldoses. Galactose is a ketose.\nc.\nGalactose and fructose are ketoses. Glucose is an aldose.\nd.\nGlucose and fructose are ketoses. Galactose is an aldose.\nGlucose, galactose, and fructose are isomeric monosaccharides (hexoses), meaning they have the same chemical formula\nbut have slightly different structures. Glucose and galactose are aldoses, and fructose is a ketose.\nMonosaccharides can exist as a linear chain or as ring-shaped molecules; in aqueous solutions they are usually found in\nring forms (Figure 3.7). Glucose in a ring form can have two different arrangements of the hydroxyl group (OH) around\nthe anomeric carbon (carbon 1 that becomes asymmetric in the process of ring formation). If the hydroxyl group is below\ncarbon number 1 in the sugar, it is said to be in the alpha (\u03b1) position, and if it is above the plane, it is said to be in the beta\n(\u03b2) position.\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\n95\nFigure 3.7 Five and six carbon monosaccharides exist in equilibrium between linear and ring forms. When the ring\nforms, the side chain it closes on is locked into an \u03b1 or \u03b2 position. Fructose and ribose also form rings, although they\nform five-membered rings as opposed to the six-membered ring of glucose.\nDisaccharides\nDisaccharides (di- = \u201ctwo\u201d) form when two monosaccharides undergo a dehydration reaction (also known as a\ncondensation reaction or dehydration synthesis). During this process, the hydroxyl group of one monosaccharide combines\nwith the hydrogen of another monosaccharide, releasing a molecule of water and forming a covalent bond. A covalent bond\nformed between a carbohydrate molecule and another molecule (in this case, between two monosaccharides) is known as a\nglycosidic bond (Figure 3.8). Glycosidic bonds (also called glycosidic linkages) can be of the alpha or the beta type.\n96\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 3.8 Sucrose is formed when a monomer of glucose and a monomer of fructose are joined in a dehydration\nreaction to form a glycosidic bond. In the process, a water molecule is lost. By convention, the carbon atoms in a\nmonosaccharide are numbered from the terminal carbon closest to the carbonyl group. In sucrose, a glycosidic linkage\nis formed between carbon 1 in glucose and carbon 2 in fructose.\nCommon disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose (Figure 3.9). Lactose is a disaccharide consisting of the\nmonomers glucose and galactose. It is found naturally in milk. Maltose, or malt sugar, is a disaccharide formed by a\ndehydration reaction between two glucose molecules. The most common disaccharide is sucrose, or table sugar, which is\ncomposed of the monomers glucose and fructose.\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\n97\nFigure 3.9 Common disaccharides include maltose (grain sugar), lactose (milk sugar), and sucrose (table sugar).\nPolysaccharides\nA long chain of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds is known as a polysaccharide (poly- = \u201cmany\u201d). The chain\nmay be branched or unbranched, and it may contain different types of monosaccharides. The molecular weight may be\n100,000 daltons or more depending on the number of monomers joined. Starch, glycogen, cellulose, and chitin are primary\nexamples of polysaccharides.\nStarch is the stored form of sugars in plants and is made up of a mixture of amylose and amylopectin (both polymers\nof glucose). Plants are able to synthesize glucose, and the excess glucose, beyond the plant\u2019s immediate energy needs, is\nstored as starch in different plant parts, including roots and seeds. The starch in the seeds provides food for the embryo\nas it germinates and can also act as a source of food for humans and animals. The starch that is consumed by humans is\nbroken down by enzymes, such as salivary amylases, into smaller molecules, such as maltose and glucose. The cells can\nthen absorb the glucose.\nStarch is made up of glucose monomers that are joined by \u03b1 1-4 or \u03b1 1-6 glycosidic bonds. The numbers 1-4 and 1-6\nrefer to the carbon number of the two residues that have joined to form the bond. As illustrated in Figure 3.10, amylose\nis starch formed by unbranched chains of glucose monomers (only \u03b1 1-4 linkages), whereas amylopectin is a branched\npolysaccharide (\u03b1 1-6 linkages at the branch points).\n98\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 3.10 Amylose and amylopectin are two different forms of starch. Amylose is composed of unbranched chains\nof glucose monomers connected by \u03b1 1,4 glycosidic linkages. Amylopectin is composed of branched chains of glucose\nmonomers connected by \u03b1 1,4 and \u03b1 1,6 glycosidic linkages. Because of the way the subunits are joined, the glucose\nchains have a helical structure. Glycogen (not shown) is similar in structure to amylopectin but more highly branched.\nGlycogen is the storage form of glucose in humans and other vertebrates and is made up of monomers of glucose. Glycogen\nis the animal equivalent of starch and is a highly branched molecule usually stored in liver and muscle cells. Whenever\nblood glucose levels decrease, glycogen is broken down to release glucose in a process known as glycogenolysis.\nCellulose is the most abundant natural biopolymer. The cell wall of plants is mostly made of cellulose; this provides\nstructural support to the cell. Wood and paper are mostly cellulosic in nature. Cellulose is made up of glucose monomers\nthat are linked by \u03b2 1-4 glycosidic bonds (Figure 3.11).\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\n99\nFigure 3.11 In cellulose, glucose monomers are linked in unbranched chains by \u03b2 1-4 glycosidic linkages. Because of\nthe way the glucose subunits are joined, every glucose monomer is flipped relative to the next one resulting in a linear,\nfibrous structure.\nAs shown in Figure 3.11, every other glucose monomer in cellulose is flipped over, and the monomers are packed tightly\nas extended long chains. This gives cellulose its rigidity and high tensile strength\u2014which is so important to plant cells.\nWhile the \u03b2 1-4 linkage cannot be broken down by human digestive enzymes, herbivores such as cows, koalas, and buffalos\nare able, with the help of the specialized flora in their stomach, to digest plant material that is rich in cellulose and use\nit as a food source. In these animals, certain species of bacteria and protists reside in the rumen (part of the digestive\nsystem of herbivores) and secrete the enzyme cellulase. The appendix of grazing animals also contains bacteria that digest\ncellulose, giving it an important role in the digestive systems of ruminants. Cellulases can break down cellulose into glucose\nmonomers that can be used as an energy source by the animal. Termites are also able to break down cellulose because of the\npresence of other organisms in their bodies that secrete cellulases.\nCarbohydrates serve various functions in different animals. Arthropods (insects, crustaceans, and others) have an outer\nskeleton, called the exoskeleton, which protects their internal body parts (as seen in the bee in Figure 3.12). This\nexoskeleton is made of the biological macromolecule chitin, which is a polysaccharide-containing nitrogen. It is made of\nrepeating units of N-acetyl-\u03b2-d-glucosamine, a modified sugar. Chitin is also a major component of fungal cell walls; fungi\nare neither animals nor plants and form a kingdom of their own in the domain Eukarya.\nFigure 3.12 Insects have a hard outer exoskeleton made of chitin, a type of polysaccharide.

They often work with\npatients in health care facilities, designing nutrition plans to treat and prevent diseases. For example,\ndietitians may teach a patient with diabetes how to manage blood sugar levels by eating the correct types\nand amounts of carbohydrates. Dietitians may also work in nursing homes, schools, and private practices.\nTo become a registered dietitian, one needs to earn at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in dietetics, nutrition,\nfood technology, or a related field. In addition, registered dietitians must complete a supervised internship\nprogram and pass a national exam. Those who pursue careers in dietetics take courses in nutrition,\nchemistry, biochemistry, biology, microbiology, and human physiology. Dietitians must become experts in\nthe chemistry and physiology (biological functions) of food (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats).\nBenefits of Carbohydrates\nAre carbohydrates good for you? People who wish to lose weight are often told that carbohydrates are bad for them and\nshould be avoided. Some diets completely forbid carbohydrate consumption, claiming that a low-carbohydrate diet helps\npeople to lose weight faster. However, carbohydrates have been an important part of the human diet for thousands of years;\nartifacts from ancient civilizations show the presence of wheat, rice, and corn in our ancestors\u2019 storage areas.\nCarbohydrates should be supplemented with proteins, vitamins, and fats to be parts of a well-balanced diet. Calorie-wise,\na gram of carbohydrate provides 4.3 Kcal. For comparison, fats provide 9 Kcal/g, a less desirable ratio. Carbohydrates\ncontain soluble and insoluble elements; the insoluble part is known as fiber, which is mostly cellulose. Fiber has many uses;\nit promotes regular bowel movement by adding bulk, and it regulates the rate of consumption of blood glucose. Fiber also\nhelps to remove excess cholesterol from the body: fiber binds to the cholesterol in the small intestine, then attaches to the\ncholesterol and prevents the cholesterol particles from entering the bloodstream, and then cholesterol exits the body via\nthe feces. In addition, a meal containing whole grains and vegetables gives a feeling of fullness. As an immediate source\nof energy, glucose is broken down during the process of cellular respiration, which produces ATP, the energy currency\nof the cell. Without the consumption of carbohydrates, the availability of \u201cinstant energy\u201d would be reduced. Eliminating\ncarbohydrates from the diet is not the best way to lose weight. A low-calorie diet that is rich in whole grains, fruits,\nvegetables, and lean meat, together with plenty of exercise and plenty of water, is the more sensible way to lose weight.\nFor an additional perspective on carbohydrates, explore \u201cBiomolecules: the Carbohydrates\u201d through this interactive\nanimation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/carbohydrates) .\nFiber is not really a nutrient, because it passes through our body undigested. Why can't fiber be digested and why is it\nimportant to our diet?\na.\nThe enzymes required to digest cellulose are not produced in human body; undigested fiber adds bulk to the\nfood easing bowel movements.\nb.\nThe enzymes that digests cellulose cannot bind to the cellulose due to altered active sites; undigested fiber\nadds bulk to the food easing bowel movements.\nc.\nThe enzymes required to digest cellulose are not produced in human body; fiber produces energy for the\nmetabolism.\nd.\nCompetitive inhibitors are not the reason that fiber is indigestible.\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\n101\nActivity\nUse a molecular model kit to construct a polysaccharide from several different monosaccharide monomers.\nExplain how the structure of the polysaccharide determines its primary function as an energy storage\nmolecule. Then use your model to describe how changes in structure result in changes in function.\nThink About It\n\u2022\nExplain why athletes often \u201ccarb-load\u201d before a big game or tournament.\n\u2022\nExplain why it is difficult for some animals, including humans, to digest cellulose. Describe a structural\ndifference between cellulose and starch, which is easily digested by humans. How are cows and other\nruminants able to digest cellulose?\n3.3 | Lipids\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the four major types of lipids?\n\u2022\nWhat are functions of fats in living organisms?\n\u2022\nWhat is the difference between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids?\n\u2022\nWhat is the molecular structure of phospholipids, and what is the role of phospholipids in cells?\n\u2022\nWhat is the basic structure of a steroid, and what are examples of their functions?\n\u2022\nHow does cholesterol help maintain the fluid nature of the plasma membrane of cells?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nLipids also are sources of energy that power cellular processes. Like carbohydrates, lipids are composed of carbon,\nhydrogen, and oxygen, but these atoms are arranged differently. Most lipids are nonpolar and hydrophobic. Major types\ninclude fats and oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. A typical fat consists of three fatty acids bonded to one molecule\nof glycerol, forming triglycerides or triacylglycerols. The fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated, depending on\nthe presence or absence of double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain; a saturated fatty acid has the maximum number\nof hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon and, thus, only single bonds. In general, fats that are liquid at room temperature\n(e.g., canola oil) tend to be more unsaturated than fats that are solid at room temperature. In the food industry, oils are\nartificially hydrogenated to make them chemically more appropriate for use in processed foods. During this hydrogenation\nprocess, double bonds in the cis- conformation in the hydrocarbon chain may be converted to double bonds in the trans-\nconformation; unfortunately, trans fats have been shown to contribute to heart disease. Phospholipids are a special type of\nlipid associated with cell membranes and typically have a glycerol (or sphingosine) backbone to which two fatty acid chains\nand a phosphate-containing group are attached. As a result, phospholipids are considered amphipathic because they have\nboth hydrophobic and hydrophilic components. (In Chapters 4 and 5 we will explore in more detail how the amphipathic\nnature of phospholipids in plasma cell membranes helps regulate the passage of substances into and out of the cell.)\nAlthough the molecular structures of steroids differ from that of triglycerides and phospholipids, steroids are classified as\nlipids based on their hydrophobic properties. Cholesterol is a type of steroid in animal cells\u2019 plasma membrane. Cholesterol\nis also the precursor of steroid hormones such as testosterone.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section, support concepts outlined in Big Idea 4 of the\nAP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework.

        "summary": "Carbohydrates are essential biological macromolecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in a 1:2:1 ratio, serving as primary energy sources and providing structural support in plants, fungi, and arthropods. They are classified into monosaccharides (simple sugars like glucose, galactose, and fructose), disaccharides (such as lactose, maltose, and sucrose), and polysaccharides (including starch, glycogen, cellulose, and chitin). Monosaccharides can exist in linear or ring forms and form glycosidic bonds through dehydration synthesis to create more complex carbohydrates. Starch and glycogen function as energy storage in plants and animals, respectively, while cellulose provides structural rigidity in plant cell walls, and chitin forms the exoskeleton of arthropods and fungal cell walls. Humans cannot digest cellulose due to the absence of cellulase, but it is valuable as dietary fiber, aiding digestion, regulating blood glucose, and reducing cholesterol. Carbohydrates yield 4.3 Kcal/g, play a vital role in energy production (via ATP from glucose), and are best consumed as part of a balanced diet with whole grains, fruits, vegetables, proteins, and fats."

This is because they are hydrocarbons\nthat include mostly nonpolar carbon\u2013carbon or carbon\u2013hydrogen bonds. Non-polar molecules are hydrophobic (\u201cwater\nfearing\u201d), or insoluble in water. Lipids perform many different functions in a cell. Cells store energy for long-term use in the\nform of fats. Lipids also provide insulation from the environment for plants and animals (Figure 3.13). For example, their\nwater-repellant hydrophobic nature can help keep aquatic birds and mammals dry by forming a protective layer over fur\nor feathers. Lipids are also the building blocks of many hormones and an important constituent of all cellular membranes.\nLipids include fats, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids.\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\n103\nFigure 3.13 Hydrophobic lipids in the fur of aquatic mammals, such as this river otter, protect them from the elements.\n(credit: Ken Bosma)\nA fat molecule consists of two main components\u2014glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol is an organic compound (alcohol) with\nthree carbons, five hydrogens, and three hydroxyl (OH) groups. Fatty acids have a long chain of hydrocarbons to which a\ncarboxyl group is attached, hence the name \u201cfatty acid.\u201d The number of carbons in the fatty acid may range from 4 to 36;\nmost common are those containing 12\u201318 carbons. In a fat molecule, the fatty acids are attached to each of the three carbons\nof the glycerol molecule with an ester bond through an oxygen atom (Figure 3.14).\n104\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 3.14 Triacylglycerol is formed by the joining of three fatty acids to a glycerol backbone in a dehydration reaction.\nThree molecules of water are released in the process.\nDuring this ester bond formation, three water molecules are released. The three fatty acids in the triacylglycerol may be\nsimilar or dissimilar. Fats are also called triacylglycerols or triglycerides because of their chemical structure. Some fatty\nacids have common names that specify their origin. For example, palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid, is derived from the\npalm tree. Arachidic acid is derived from Arachis hypogea, the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts.\nFatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. In a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds between neighboring carbons\nin the hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is said to be saturated. Saturated fatty acids are saturated with hydrogen; in other\nwords, the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized. Stearic acid is an example of a saturated\nfatty acid (Figure 3.15)\nFigure 3.15 Stearic acid is a common saturated fatty acid.\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\n105\nWhen the hydrocarbon chain contains a double bond, the fatty acid is said to be unsaturated. Oleic acid is an example of\nan unsaturated fatty acid (Figure 3.16).\nFigure 3.16 Oleic acid is a common unsaturated fatty acid.\nMost unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature and are called oils. If there is one double bond in the molecule, then\nit is known as a monounsaturated fat (e.g., olive oil), and if there is more than one double bond, then it is known as a\npolyunsaturated fat (e.g., canola oil).\nWhen a fatty acid has no double bonds, it is known as a saturated fatty acid because no more hydrogen may be added to the\ncarbon atoms of the chain. A fat may contain similar or different fatty acids attached to glycerol. Long straight fatty acids\nwith single bonds tend to get packed tightly and are solid at room temperature. Animal fats with stearic acid and palmitic\nacid (common in meat) and the fat with butyric acid (common in butter) are examples of saturated fats. Mammals store fats\nin specialized cells called adipocytes, where globules of fat occupy most of the cell\u2019s volume. In plants, fat or oil is stored\nin many seeds and is used as a source of energy during seedling development. Unsaturated fats or oils are usually of plant\norigin and contain cis unsaturated fatty acids. Cis and trans indicate the configuration of the molecule around the double\nbond. If hydrogens are present in the same plane, it is referred to as a cis fat; if the hydrogen atoms are on two different\nplanes, it is referred to as a trans fat. The cis double bond causes a bend or a \u201ckink\u201d that prevents the fatty acids from\npacking tightly, keeping them liquid at room temperature (Figure 3.17). Olive oil, corn oil, canola oil, and cod liver oil are\nexamples of unsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats help to lower blood cholesterol levels whereas saturated fats contribute to\nplaque formation in the arteries.\n106\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 3.17 Saturated fatty acids have hydrocarbon chains connected by single bonds only. Unsaturated fatty acids\nhave one or more double bonds. Each double bond may be in a cis or trans configuration. In the cis configuration, both\nhydrogens are on the same side of the hydrocarbon chain. In the trans configuration, the hydrogens are on opposite\nsides. A cis double bond causes a kink in the chain.\nTrans Fats\nIn the food industry, oils are artificially hydrogenated to make them semi-solid and of a consistency desirable for many\nprocessed food products. Simply speaking, hydrogen gas is bubbled through oils to solidify them. During this hydrogenation\nprocess, double bonds of the cis- conformation in the hydrocarbon chain may be converted to double bonds in the trans-\nconformation.\nMargarine, some types of peanut butter, and shortening are examples of artificially hydrogenated trans fats. Recent studies\nhave shown that an increase in trans fats in the human diet may lead to an increase in levels of low-density lipoproteins\n(LDL), or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, which in turn may lead to plaque deposition in the arteries, resulting in heart disease. Many\nfast food restaurants have recently banned the use of trans fats, and food labels are required to display the trans fat content.\nOmega Fatty Acids\nEssential fatty acids are fatty acids required but not synthesized by the human body. Consequently, they have to be\nsupplemented through ingestion via the diet. Omega-3 fatty acids (like that shown in Figure 3.18) fall into this category\nand are one of only two known for humans (the other being omega-6 fatty acid). These are polyunsaturated fatty acids and\nare called omega-3 because the third carbon from the end of the hydrocarbon chain is connected to its neighboring carbon\nby a double bond.\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\n107\nFigure 3.18 Alpha-linolenic acid is an example of an omega-3 fatty acid. It has three cis double bonds and, as a result,\na curved shape. For clarity, the carbons are not shown. Each singly bonded carbon has two hydrogens associated with\nit, also not shown.\nThe farthest carbon away from the carboxyl group is numbered as the omega (\u03c9) carbon, and if the double bond is\nbetween the third and fourth carbon from that end, it is known as an omega-3 fatty acid. Nutritionally important because\nthe body does not make them, omega-3 fatty acids include alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and\ndocosahexaenoic acid (DHA), all of which are polyunsaturated. Salmon, trout, and tuna are good sources of omega-3 fatty\nacids. Research indicates that omega-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of sudden death from heart attacks, reduce triglycerides in\nthe blood, lower blood pressure, and prevent thrombosis by inhibiting blood clotting. They also reduce inflammation, and\nmay help reduce the risk of some cancers in animals.\nLike carbohydrates, fats have received a lot of bad publicity. It is true that eating an excess of fried foods and other \u201cfatty\u201d\nfoods leads to weight gain. However, fats do have important functions. Many vitamins are fat soluble, and fats serve as a\nlong-term storage form of fatty acids: a source of energy. They also provide insulation for the body. Therefore, \u201chealthy\u201d\nfats in moderate amounts should be consumed on a regular basis.\nThink About It\nExplain why trans fats have been banned from some restaurants. How are trans fats made, and what effect does a\nsimple chemical change have on the properties of the lipid?\nWaxes\nWax covers the feathers of some aquatic birds and the leaf surfaces of some plants. Because of the hydrophobic nature of\nwaxes, they prevent water from sticking on the surface (Figure 3.19). Waxes are made up of long fatty acid chains esterified\nto long-chain alcohols.\n108\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 3.19 Waxy coverings on some leaves are made of lipids. (credit: Roger Griffith)\nPhospholipids\nPhospholipids are major constituents of the plasma membrane, the outermost layer of all living cells. Like fats, they are\ncomposed of fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol or sphingosine backbone. Instead of three fatty acids attached as in\ntriglycerides, however, there are two fatty acids forming diacylglycerol, and the third carbon of the glycerol backbone is\noccupied by a modified phosphate group (Figure 3.20). A phosphate group alone attached to a diaglycerol does not qualify\nas a phospholipid; it is phosphatidate (diacylglycerol 3-phosphate), the precursor of phospholipids. The phosphate group\nis modified by an alcohol. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine are two important phospholipids that are found in\nplasma membranes.\nFigure 3.20 A phospholipid is a molecule with two fatty acids and a modified phosphate group attached to a glycerol\nbackbone. The phosphate may be modified by the addition of charged or polar chemical groups.\nA phospholipid is an amphipathic molecule, meaning it has a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic part. The fatty acid chains are\nhydrophobic and cannot interact with water, whereas the phosphate-containing group is hydrophilic and interacts with water\n(Figure 3.21).\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\n109\nFigure 3.21 The phospholipid bilayer is the major component of all cellular membranes. The hydrophilic head groups\nof the phospholipids face the aqueous solution. The hydrophobic tails are sequestered in the middle of the bilayer.\nThe head is the hydrophilic part, and the tail contains the hydrophobic fatty acids. In a membrane, a bilayer of phospholipids\nforms the matrix of the structure, the fatty acid tails of phospholipids face inside, away from water, whereas the phosphate\ngroup faces the outside, aqueous side (Figure 3.21).\nPhospholipids are responsible for the dynamic nature of the plasma membrane. If a drop of phospholipids is placed in water,\nit spontaneously forms a structure known as a micelle, where the hydrophilic phosphate heads face the outside and the fatty\nacids face the interior of this structure.\nFats are amphiphilic molecules. In other words, the long hydrocarbon tail is hydrophobic, and the glycerol\npart of the molecule is hydrophilic. When in water, fats will arrange themselves into a ball called a micelle\nso that the hydrophilic \u201cheads\u201d are on the outer surface, and the hydrophobic \u201ctails\u201d are on the inside where\nthey are protected from the surrounding water.\nFigure 3.22\nSteroids\nUnlike the phospholipids and fats discussed earlier, steroids have a fused ring structure. Although they do not resemble the\nother lipids, they are grouped with them because they are also hydrophobic and insoluble in water. All steroids have four\nlinked carbon rings and several of them, like cholesterol, have a short tail (Figure 3.23). Many steroids also have the \u2013OH\nfunctional group, which puts them in the alcohol classification (sterols).\n110\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 3.23 Steroids such as cholesterol and cortisol are composed of four fused hydrocarbon rings.\nCholesterol is the most common steroid. Cholesterol is mainly synthesized in the liver and is the precursor to many steroid\nhormones such as testosterone and estradiol, which are secreted by the gonads and endocrine glands. It is also the precursor\nto Vitamin D. Cholesterol is also the precursor of bile salts, which help in the emulsification of fats and their subsequent\nabsorption by cells. Although cholesterol is often spoken of in negative terms by lay people, it is necessary for proper\nfunctioning of the body. It is a component of the plasma membrane of animal cells and is found within the phospholipid\nbilayer.

        "summary": "Lipids are a diverse group of mostly nonpolar, hydrophobic molecules composed primarily of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, functioning in long-term energy storage, insulation, membrane structure, and hormone production. The four major types are fats (triglycerides), phospholipids, steroids, and waxes. Fats consist of glycerol bonded to three fatty acids, which may be saturated (single bonds, solid at room temperature) or unsaturated (one or more double bonds, often liquid); unsaturated fats can be cis (bent chains) or harmful trans fats (formed by hydrogenation). Essential fatty acids like omega-3 must be obtained from the diet and support heart health, reduce inflammation, and provide other benefits. Waxes are water-repellent lipid coatings found on plants and animals. Phospholipids, with two fatty acids and a phosphate group, are amphipathic and form bilayers in plasma membranes, enabling selective permeability. Steroids have a fused four-ring structure and include cholesterol, which maintains membrane fluidity and serves as a precursor to hormones, vitamin D, and bile salts. Despite negative associations, certain dietary fats are essential for nutrient absorption, energy storage, and normal bodily function."

Proteins may be structural, regulatory, contractile, or protective; they may serve in transport, storage,\nor membranes; or they may be toxins or enzymes. Each cell in a living system may contain thousands of proteins, each\nwith a unique function. Their structures, like their functions, vary greatly. They are all, however, polymers of amino acids,\narranged in a linear sequence.\nEnzymes, which are produced by living cells, are catalysts in biochemical reactions (like digestion) and are usually complex\nor conjugated proteins. Each enzyme is specific for the substrate (a reactant that binds to an enzyme) it acts on. The enzyme\nmay help in breakdown, rearrangement, or synthesis reactions. Enzymes that break down their substrates are called catabolic\nenzymes, enzymes that build more complex molecules from their substrates are called anabolic enzymes, and enzymes that\naffect the rate of reaction are called catalytic enzymes. It should be noted that all enzymes increase the rate of reaction\nand, therefore, are considered to be organic catalysts. An example of an enzyme is salivary amylase, which hydrolyzes its\nsubstrate amylose, a component of starch.\nHormones are chemical-signaling molecules, usually small proteins or steroids, secreted by endocrine cells that act to\ncontrol or regulate specific physiological processes, including growth, development, metabolism, and reproduction. For\nexample, insulin is a protein hormone that helps to regulate the blood glucose level. The primary types and functions of\nproteins are listed in Table 3.1.\nProtein Types and Functions\nType\nExamples\nFunctions\nDigestive\nEnzymes\nAmylase, lipase, pepsin, trypsin\nHelp in digestion of food by catabolizing nutrients into\nmonomeric units\nTransport\nHemoglobin, albumin\nCarry substances in the blood or lymph throughout the\nbody\nStructural\nActin, tubulin, keratin\nConstruct different structures, like the cytoskeleton\nHormones\nInsulin, thyroxine\nCoordinate the activity of different body systems\nDefense\nImmunoglobulins\nProtect the body from foreign pathogens\nContractile\nActin, myosin\nEffect muscle contraction\nStorage\nLegume storage proteins, egg\nwhite (albumin)\nProvide nourishment in early development of the embryo\nand the seedling\nTable 3.1\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\n113\nProteins have different shapes and molecular weights; some proteins are globular in shape whereas others are fibrous in\nnature. For example, hemoglobin is a globular protein, but collagen, found in our skin, is a fibrous protein. Protein shape is\ncritical to its function, and this shape is maintained by many different types of chemical bonds. Changes in temperature, pH,\nand exposure to chemicals may lead to permanent changes in the shape of the protein, leading to loss of function, known as\ndenaturation. All proteins are made up of different arrangements of the most common 20 types of amino acids.\nAmino Acids\nAmino acids are the monomers that make up proteins. Each amino acid has the same fundamental structure, which consists\nof a central carbon atom, also known as the alpha (\u03b1) carbon, bonded to an amino group (NH2), a carboxyl group (COOH),\nand to a hydrogen atom. Every amino acid also has another atom or group of atoms bonded to the central atom known as\nthe R group (Figure 3.24).\nFigure 3.24 Amino acids have a central asymmetric carbon to which an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen\natom, and a side chain (R group) are attached.\nThe name \"amino acid\" is derived from the fact that they contain both amino group and carboxyl-acid-group in their basic\nstructure. As mentioned, there are 20 common amino acids present in proteins. Nine of these are considered essential amino\nacids in humans because the human body cannot produce them and they are obtained from the diet. For each amino acid,\nthe R group (or side chain) is different (Figure 3.25).\n114\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 3.25 There are typically 20 common amino acids commonly found in proteins, each with a different R\ngroup (variant group) that determines its chemical nature.\nWhich categories of amino acid would you expect to find on the surface of a soluble protein, and which would you\nexpect to find in the interior?\na.\nPolar and charged amino acids will be found on the surface. Non-polar amino acids will be found in the\ninterior.\nb.\nPolar and charged amino acids will be found in the interior. Non-polar amino acids will be found on the\nsurface.\nc.\nNon-polar and uncharged proteins will be found on the surface as well as in the interior.\nThe chemical nature of the side chain determines the nature of the amino acid (that is, whether it is acidic, basic, polar,\nor nonpolar). For example, the amino acid glycine has a hydrogen atom as the R group. Amino acids such as valine,\nmethionine, and alanine are nonpolar or hydrophobic in nature, while amino acids such as serine, threonine, and cysteine\nare polar and have hydrophilic side chains. The side chains of lysine and arginine are positively charged, and therefore these\namino acids are also known as basic amino acids. Proline has an R group that is linked to the amino group, forming a ring-\nlike structure. Proline is an exception to the standard structure of an animo acid since its amino group is not separate from\nthe side chain (Figure 3.25).\nAmino acids are represented by a single upper case letter or a three-letter abbreviation. For example, valine is known by\nthe letter V or the three-letter symbol val. Just as some fatty acids are essential to a diet, some amino acids are necessary\nas well. They are known as essential amino acids, and in humans they include isoleucine, leucine, and cysteine. Essential\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\n115\namino acids refer to those necessary for construction of proteins in the body, although not produced by the body; which\namino acids are essential varies from organism to organism.\nThe sequence and the number of amino acids ultimately determine the protein's shape, size, and function. Each amino acid\nis attached to another amino acid by a covalent bond, known as a peptide bond, which is formed by a dehydration reaction.\nThe carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the incoming amino acid combine, releasing a molecule of\nwater. The resulting bond is the peptide bond (Figure 3.26).\nFigure 3.26 Peptide bond formation is a dehydration synthesis reaction. The carboxyl group of one amino acid is linked\nto the amino group of the incoming amino acid. In the process, a molecule of water is released.\nThe products formed by such linkages are called peptides. As more amino acids join to this growing chain, the resulting\nchain is known as a polypeptide. Each polypeptide has a free amino group at one end. This end is called the N terminal,\nor the amino terminal, and the other end has a free carboxyl group, also known as the C or carboxyl terminal. While the\nterms polypeptide and protein are sometimes used interchangeably, a polypeptide is technically a polymer of amino acids,\nwhereas the term protein is used for a polypeptide or polypeptides that have combined together, often have bound non-\npeptide prosthetic groups, have a distinct shape, and have a unique function. After protein synthesis (translation), most\nproteins are modified. These are known as post-translational modifications. They may undergo cleavage or phosphorylation,\nor may require the addition of other chemical groups. Only after these modifications is the protein completely functional.\nClick through the steps of protein synthesis in this interactive tutorial (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/protein_synth) .\nWhy is the process of protein synthesis critical to life?\na.\nProtein is the body\u2019s preferred source for energy for rapid energy production.\nb.\nProtein is stored in the liver and muscles to supply energy for future use.\nc.\nProtein is required for tissue formation and constitutes hormones and enzymes.\nd.\nProteins are required for the absorption of all fat soluble vitamins.\n116\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nCytochrome c is an important component of the electron transport chain, a part of cellular respiration, and\nit is normally found in the cellular organelle, the mitochondrion. This protein has a heme prosthetic group,\nand the central ion of the heme gets alternately reduced and oxidized during electron transfer. Because this\nessential protein\u2019s role in producing cellular energy is crucial, it has changed very little over millions of years.\nProtein sequencing has shown that there is a considerable amount of cytochrome c amino acid sequence\nhomology among different species; in other words, evolutionary kinship can be assessed by measuring the\nsimilarities or differences among various species\u2019 DNA or protein sequences.\nScientists have determined that human cytochrome c contains 104 amino acids. For each cytochrome c\nmolecule from different organisms that has been sequenced to date, 37 of these amino acids appear in the\nsame position in all samples of cytochrome c. This indicates that there may have been a common ancestor.\nOn comparing the human and chimpanzee protein sequences, no sequence difference was found. When\nhuman and rhesus monkey sequences were compared, the single difference found was in one amino acid.\nIn another comparison, human to yeast sequencing shows a difference in the 44th position.\nThe protein sequence of cytochrome c from chimpanzees and humans is identical. The protein sequence of cytochrome\nc from rhesus monkeys differs from the human sequence by one amino acid. What do these comparisons suggest?\na.\nRhesus monkeys are more closely related to humans than chimpanzees.\nb.\nChimpanzees are more closely related to rhesus monkeys than to humans.\nc.\nHumans are related to chimpanzees, but are not related to rhesus monkeys.\nd.\nChimpanzees are more closely related to humans than rhesus monkeys.\nProtein Structure\nAs discussed earlier, the shape of a protein is critical to its function. For example, an enzyme can bind to a specific substrate\nat a site known as the active site. If this active site is altered because of local changes or changes in overall protein structure,\nthe enzyme may be unable to bind to the substrate. To understand how the protein gets its final shape or conformation, we\nneed to understand the four levels of protein structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.\nPrimary Structure\nThe unique sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure. For example, the pancreatic hormone\ninsulin has two polypeptide chains, A and B, and they are linked together by disulfide bonds. The N terminal amino acid of\nthe A chain is glycine, whereas the C terminal amino acid is asparagine (Figure 3.27). The sequences of amino acids in the\nA and B chains are unique to insulin.\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\n117\nFigure 3.27 Bovine serum insulin is a protein hormone made of two peptide chains, A (21 amino acids long) and B (30\namino acids long). In each chain, primary structure is indicated by three-letter abbreviations that represent the names\nof the amino acids in the order they are present. The amino acid cysteine (cys) has a sulfhydryl (SH) group as a side\nchain. Two sulfhydryl groups can react in the presence of oxygen to form a disulfide (S-S) bond. Two disulfide bonds\nconnect the A and B chains together, and a third helps the A chain fold into the correct shape. Note that all disulfide\nbonds are the same length, but are drawn different sizes for clarity.\nThe unique sequence for every protein is ultimately determined by the gene encoding the protein. A change in nucleotide\nsequence of the gene\u2019s coding region may lead to a different amino acid being added to the growing polypeptide chain,\ncausing a change in protein structure and function. In sickle cell anemia, the hemoglobin \u03b2 chain (a small portion of\nwhich is shown in Figure 3.28) has a single amino acid substitution, causing a change in protein structure and function.\nSpecifically, the amino acid glutamic acid is substituted by valine in the \u03b2 chain. What is most remarkable to consider is\nthat a hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha chains and two beta chains that each consist of about 150 amino acids.\nThe molecule, therefore, has about 600 amino acids. The structural difference between a normal hemoglobin molecule and\na sickle cell molecule\u2014which dramatically decreases life expectancy\u2014is a single amino acid of the 600. What is even more\nremarkable is that those 600 amino acids are encoded by three nucleotides each, and the mutation is caused by a single base\nchange (point mutation), 1 in 1800 bases.\nFigure 3.28 The beta chain of hemoglobin is 147 residues in length, yet a single amino acid substitution leads to\nsickle cell anemia. In normal hemoglobin, the amino acid at position seven is glutamate. In sickle cell hemoglobin, this\nglutamate is replaced by a valine.\nBecause of this change of one amino acid in the chain, hemoglobin molecules form long fibers that distort the biconcave,\nor disc-shaped, red blood cells and cause them to assume a crescent or \u201csickle\u201d shape, which clogs blood vessels (Figure\n3.29). This can lead to myriad serious health problems such as breathlessness, dizziness, headaches, and abdominal pain for\nthose affected by this disease.\n118\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 3.29 In this blood smear, visualized at 535x magnification using bright field microscopy, sickle cells are crescent\nshaped, while normal cells are disc-shaped. (credit: modification of work by Ed Uthman; scale-bar data from Matt\nRussell)\nSecondary Structure\nThe local folding of the polypeptide in some regions gives rise to the secondary structure of the protein. The most common\nare the \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-pleated sheet structures (Figure 3.30). Both structures are held together by hydrogen bonds. In the\n\u03b1-helix structure, the hydrogen bonds form between the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group in one amino acid and another\namino acid that is four amino acids farther along the chain.\nFigure 3.30 The \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-pleated sheet are secondary structures of proteins that form because of hydrogen\nbonding between carbonyl and amino groups in the peptide backbone. Certain amino acids have a propensity to form\nan \u03b1-helix, while others have a propensity to form a \u03b2-pleated sheet.\nEvery helical turn in an alpha helix has 3.6 amino acid residues. The R groups (the variant groups) of the polypeptide\nprotrude out from the \u03b1-helix chain. In the \u03b2-pleated sheet, the \u201cpleats\u201d are formed by hydrogen bonding between atoms on\nthe backbone of the polypeptide chain. The R groups are attached to the carbons and extend above and below the folds of\nthe pleat. The pleated segments align parallel or antiparallel to each other, and hydrogen bonds form between the partially\npositive nitrogen atom in the amino group and the partially negative oxygen atom in the carbonyl group of the peptide\nbackbone. The \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-pleated sheet structures are found in most globular and fibrous proteins and they play an\nimportant structural role.\nTertiary Structure\nThe unique three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide is its tertiary structure (Figure 3.31). This structure is in part\ndue to chemical interactions at work on the polypeptide chain. Primarily, the interactions among R groups creates the\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\n119\ncomplex three-dimensional tertiary structure of a protein. The nature of the R groups found in the amino acids involved\ncan counteract the formation of the hydrogen bonds described for standard secondary structures. For example, R groups\nwith like charges are repelled by each other and those with unlike charges are attracted to each other (ionic bonds). When\nprotein folding takes place, the hydrophobic R groups of nonpolar amino acids lie in the interior of the protein, whereas\nthe hydrophilic R groups lie on the outside. The former types of interactions are also known as hydrophobic interactions.\nInteraction between cysteine side chains forms disulfide linkages in the presence of oxygen, the only covalent bond forming\nduring protein folding.\nFigure 3.31 The tertiary structure of proteins is determined by a variety of chemical interactions. These include\nhydrophobic interactions, ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding and disulfide linkages.\nAll of these interactions, weak and strong, determine the final three-dimensional shape of the protein. When a protein loses\nits three-dimensional shape, it may no longer be functional.\nQuaternary Structure\nIn nature, some proteins are formed from several polypeptides, also known as subunits, and the interaction of these\nsubunits forms the quaternary structure. Weak interactions between the subunits help to stabilize the overall structure. For\nexample, insulin (a globular protein) has a combination of hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds that cause it to be mostly\nclumped into a ball shape. Insulin starts out as a single polypeptide and loses some internal sequences in the presence of\npost-translational modification after the formation of the disulfide linkages that hold the remaining chains together. Silk (a\nfibrous protein), however, has a \u03b2-pleated sheet structure that is the result of hydrogen bonding between different chains.\nThe four levels of protein structure (primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary) are illustrated in Figure 3.32.\n120\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 3.32 The four levels of protein structure can be observed in these illustrations. (credit: modification of work by\nNational Human Genome Research Institute)\nDenaturation and Protein Folding\nEach protein has its own unique sequence and shape that are held together by chemical interactions. If the protein is\nsubject to changes in temperature, changes in pH, or exposure to chemicals, the protein structure may change, losing its\nshape without losing its primary sequence in what is known as denaturation. Denaturation is often reversible because the\nprimary structure of the polypeptide is conserved in the process if the denaturing agent is removed, allowing the protein to\nresume its function. Sometimes denaturation is irreversible, leading to loss of function. One example of irreversible protein\ndenaturation is when an egg is fried. The albumin protein in the liquid egg white is denatured when placed in a hot pan. Not\nall proteins are denatured at high temperatures; for instance, bacteria that survive in hot springs have proteins that function at\ntemperatures close to boiling. The stomach is also very acidic, has a low pH, and denatures proteins as part of the digestion\nprocess; however, the digestive enzymes of the stomach retain their activity under these conditions.\nProtein folding is critical to its function. It was originally thought that the proteins themselves were responsible for the\nfolding process. Only recently was it found that often they receive assistance in the folding process from protein helpers\nknown as chaperones (or chaperonins) that associate with the target protein during the folding process. They act by\npreventing aggregation of polypeptides that make up the complete protein structure, and they disassociate from the protein\nonce the target protein is folded.\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\n121\nFor an additional perspective on proteins, view this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/proteins) called\n\u201cBiomolecules: The Proteins.\u201d\nVegans are people who do not consume any animal products in their diet.

        "summary": "Proteins are abundant, diverse macromolecules made of linear sequences of 20 common amino acids, each with an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a unique side chain (R group) that determines its chemical nature. Amino acids link via peptide bonds, forming polypeptides that fold into specific shapes essential for function. Proteins serve structural, regulatory, contractile, transport, storage, protective, enzymatic, and signaling roles, with shape maintained by various chemical interactions but vulnerable to denaturation from changes in temperature, pH, or chemicals. Protein structure occurs at four levels: primary (amino acid sequence), secondary (\u03b1-helices and \u03b2-pleated sheets stabilized by hydrogen bonds), tertiary (three-dimensional folding driven by R group interactions, disulfide linkages, hydrophobic effects, ionic and hydrogen bonds), and quaternary (assembly of multiple polypeptide subunits). Proper folding, sometimes aided by chaperone proteins, is critical to function, and even a single amino acid substitution, as in sickle cell anemia, can drastically alter structure and activity. Some amino acids are essential in the human diet since they cannot be synthesized by the body, and protein sequence similarities can reveal evolutionary relationships."

Conserved through evolution in all organisms, nucleic acids store and\ntransmit hereditary information. As will be explored in more detail in Chapters 14-17, DNA contains the instructions for the\nsynthesis of proteins by dictating the sequences of amino acids in polypeptides through processes known as transcription\nand translation. Nucleic acids are made up of nucleotides; in turn, each nucleotide consists of a pentose sugar (deoxyribose\nin DNA and ribose in RNA), a nitrogenous base (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine or uracil), and a phosphate\ngroup. DNA carries the genetic blueprint of the cell that is passed from parent to offspring via cell division. DNA has a\ndouble-helical structure with the two strands running in opposite directions (antiparallel), connected by hydrogen bonds and\ncomplementary to each other. In DNA, purines pair with pyrimidines: adenine pairs with thymine (A-T), and cytosine pairs\nwith guanine (C-G). In RNA, uracil replaces thymine to pair with adenine (U-A). RNA also differs from DNA in that it is\nsingle-stranded and has many forms, such as messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA)\nthat all participate in the synthesis of proteins. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the use of mRNA. The flow of genetic\ninformation is usually DNA \u2192 RNA \u2192 protein, also known as the Central Dogma of Life.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined in\nBig Idea 3 and Big Idea 4 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 3.1] [APLO 4.17]\nDNA and RNA\nNucleic acids are the most important macromolecules for the continuity of life. They carry the genetic blueprint of a cell\nand carry instructions for the functioning of the cell.\nThe two main types of nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). DNA is the genetic\nmaterial found in all living organisms, ranging from single-celled bacteria to multicellular mammals. It is found in the\nnucleus of eukaryotes and in the organelles, chloroplasts, and mitochondria. In prokaryotes, the DNA is not enclosed in a\nmembranous envelope.\nThe entire genetic content of a cell is known as its genome, and the study of genomes is genomics. In eukaryotic cells but not\nin prokaryotes, DNA forms a complex with histone proteins to form chromatin, the substance of eukaryotic chromosomes.\nA chromosome may contain tens of thousands of genes. Many genes contain the information to make protein products;\nother genes code for RNA products. DNA controls all of the cellular activities by turning the genes \u201con\u201d or \u201coff.\u201d\nThe other type of nucleic acid, RNA, is mostly involved in protein synthesis. The DNA molecules never leave the nucleus\nbut instead use an intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell. This intermediary is the messenger RNA (mRNA).\nOther types of RNA\u2014like rRNA, tRNA, and microRNA\u2014are involved in protein synthesis and its regulation.\nDNA and RNA are made up of monomers known as nucleotides. The nucleotides combine with each other to form a\npolynucleotide, DNA or RNA. Each nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose (five-\ncarbon) sugar, and a phosphate group (Figure 3.33). Each nitrogenous base in a nucleotide is attached to a sugar molecule,\nwhich is attached to one or more phosphate groups.\n124\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 3.33 A nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and one or more\nphosphate groups. Carbon residues in the pentose are numbered 1\u2032 through 5\u2032 (the prime distinguishes these residues\nfrom those in the base, which are numbered without using a prime notation). The base is attached to the 1\u2032 position of\nthe ribose, and the phosphate is attached to the 5\u2032 position. When a polynucleotide is formed, the 5\u2032 phosphate of the\nincoming nucleotide attaches to the 3\u2032 hydroxyl group at the end of the growing chain. Two types of pentose are found\nin nucleotides, deoxyribose (found in DNA) and ribose (found in RNA). Deoxyribose is similar in structure to ribose,\nbut it has an H instead of an OH at the 2\u2032 position. Bases can be divided into two categories: purines and pyrimidines.\nPurines have a double ring structure, and pyrimidines have a single ring.\nThe nitrogenous bases, important components of nucleotides, are organic molecules and are so named because they contain\ncarbon and nitrogen. They are bases because they contain an amino group that has the potential of binding an extra\nhydrogen, thus decreasing the hydrogen ion concentration in its environment, making it more basic. Each nucleotide in\nDNA contains one of four possible nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), guanine (G) cytosine (C), and thymine (T).\nAdenine and guanine are classified as purines. The primary structure of a purine is two carbon-nitrogen rings. Cytosine,\nthymine, and uracil are classified as pyrimidines which have a single carbon-nitrogen ring as their primary structure\n(Figure 3.33). Each of these basic carbon-nitrogen rings has different functional groups attached to it. In molecular biology\nshorthand, the nitrogenous bases are simply known by their symbols A, T, G, C, and U. DNA contains A, T, G, and C\nwhereas RNA contains A, U, G, and C.\nThe pentose sugar in DNA is deoxyribose, and in RNA, the sugar is ribose (Figure 3.33). The difference between the\nsugars is the presence of the hydroxyl group on the second carbon of the ribose and hydrogen on the second carbon of the\ndeoxyribose. The carbon atoms of the sugar molecule are numbered as 1\u2032, 2\u2032, 3\u2032, 4\u2032, and 5\u2032 (1\u2032 is read as \u201cone prime\u201d). The\nphosphate residue is attached to the hydroxyl group of the 5\u2032 carbon of one sugar and the hydroxyl group of the 3\u2032 carbon\nof the sugar of the next nucleotide, which forms a 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 phosphodiester linkage. The phosphodiester linkage is not formed\nby simple dehydration reaction like the other linkages connecting monomers in macromolecules: its formation involves the\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\n125\nremoval of two phosphate groups. A polynucleotide may have thousands of such phosphodiester linkages.\nDNA Double-Helix Structure\nDNA has a double-helix structure (Figure 3.34). The sugar and phosphate lie on the outside of the helix, forming the\nbackbone of the DNA. The nitrogenous bases are stacked in the interior, like the steps of a staircase, in pairs; the pairs are\nbound to each other by hydrogen bonds. Every base pair in the double helix is separated from the next base pair by 0.34 nm.\nThe two strands of the helix run in opposite directions, meaning that the 5\u2032 carbon end of one strand will face the 3\u2032 carbon\nend of its matching strand. (This is referred to as antiparallel orientation and is important to DNA replication and in many\nnucleic acid interactions.)\nFigure 3.34 Native DNA is an antiparallel double helix. The phosphate backbone (indicated by the curvy lines) is on\nthe outside, and the bases are on the inside. Each base from one strand interacts via hydrogen bonding with a base\nfrom the opposing strand. (credit: Jerome Walker/Dennis Myts)\nOnly certain types of base pairing are allowed. For example, a certain purine can only pair with a certain pyrimidine. This\nmeans A can pair with T, and G can pair with C, as shown in Figure 3.35. This is known as the base complementary\nrule. In other words, the DNA strands are complementary to each other. If the sequence of one strand is AATTGGCC, the\ncomplementary strand would have the sequence TTAACCGG. During DNA replication, each strand is copied, resulting in\na daughter DNA double helix containing one parental DNA strand and a newly synthesized strand.\n126\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 3.35 In a double stranded DNA molecule, the two strands run antiparallel to one another so that one strand\nruns 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 and the other 3\u2032 to 5\u2032. The phosphate backbone is located on the outside, and the bases are in the\nmiddle. Adenine forms hydrogen bonds (or base pairs) with thymine, and guanine base pairs with cytosine.\nA mutation occurs, and cytosine is replaced with adenine. What impact do you think this will have on the DNA\nstructure?\na.\nThe DNA will normally pair its adenine with thymine, causing no change in the DNA structure.\nb.\nThe DNA will bulge in the places where cytosine is replaced by adenine.\nc.\nThe adenine substituted in the place of cytosine will get methylated and will not be transcribed further.\nd.\nThe DNA will cause another mutation to replace this incorrect DNA base.\nRNA\nRibonucleic acid, or RNA, is mainly involved in the process of protein synthesis under the direction of DNA. RNA is\nusually single-stranded and is made of ribonucleotides that are linked by phosphodiester bonds. A ribonucleotide in the\nRNA chain contains ribose (the pentose sugar), one of the four nitrogenous bases (A, U, G, and C), and the phosphate group.\nThere are four major types of RNA: messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and\nmicroRNA (miRNA). The first, mRNA, carries the message from DNA, which controls all of the cellular activities in a\ncell. If a cell requires a certain protein to be synthesized, the gene for this product is turned \u201con\u201d and the messenger RNA\nis synthesized in the nucleus. The RNA base sequence is complementary to the coding sequence of the DNA from which\nit has been copied. However, in RNA, the base T is absent and U is present instead. If the DNA strand has a sequence\nAATTGCGC, the sequence of the complementary RNA is UUAACGCG. In the cytoplasm, the mRNA interacts with\nribosomes and other cellular machinery (Figure 3.36).\nChapter 3 | Biological Macromolecules\n127\nFigure 3.36 A ribosome has two parts: a large subunit and a small subunit. The mRNA sits in between the two\nsubunits. A tRNA molecule recognizes a codon on the mRNA, binds to it by complementary base pairing, and adds\nthe correct amino acid to the growing peptide chain.\nThe mRNA is read in sets of three bases known as codons. Each codon codes for a single amino acid. In this way, the\nmRNA is read and the protein product is made. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a major constituent of ribosomes on which\nthe mRNA binds. The rRNA ensures the proper alignment of the mRNA and the ribosomes; the rRNA of the ribosome\nalso has an enzymatic activity (peptidyl transferase) and catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds between two aligned\namino acids. Transfer RNA (tRNA) is one of the smallest of the four types of RNA, usually 70\u201390 nucleotides long. It\ncarries the correct amino acid to the site of protein synthesis. It is the base pairing between the tRNA and mRNA that allows\nfor the correct amino acid to be inserted in the polypeptide chain. microRNAs are the smallest RNA molecules and their\nrole involves the regulation of gene expression by interfering with the expression of certain mRNA messages.

What is the basic building block of that wall? A single brick, of course. Like a\nbrick wall, your body is composed of basic building blocks called \u201ccells.\u201d\nYour body has many kinds of cells, each specialized for a specific purpose. Just as a home is made from a variety of\nbuilding materials, the human body is constructed from many cell types. For example, epithelial cells protect the surface of\nthe body and cover the organs and body cavities within. Bone cells help to support and protect the body. Immune system\ncells fight invading pathogens. Additionally, blood cells carry nutrients and oxygen throughout the body while removing\ncarbon dioxide and other waste. Each of these cell types plays a vital role during the growth, development, and ongoing\nmaintenance of the body. In spite of their enormous variety, however, cells from all organisms\u2014even organisms as diverse\nas bacteria, onion, and human\u2014share certain fundamental characteristics.\nIn humans, before a cell develops into its specialized type, it is called a stem cell. A stem cell is a cell that has not undergone\nthe changes involved in specialization. In this state, it may differentiate to become one of many different specialized cells,\nand it may divide to produce more stem cells. Under normal circumstances, once a cell becomes specialized, it remains that\nway. However, scientists have been working on coaxing stem cells in the laboratory to become a particular specialization.\nFor example, scientists at the Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center have learned how to use stem cells to grow\nstomach tissue in plastic cell and tissue culture dishes. This accomplishment will enable researchers to study gastric human\ndiseases, such as stomach cancer. You can read more about it here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32cellsize) .\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\n147\n4.1 | Studying Cells\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat is the role of cells in organisms?\n\u2022\nWhat is the difference between light microscopy and electron microscopy?\n\u2022\nWhat is the cell theory?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nA cell is the smallest unit of a living thing. A living thing, whether made of one cell (like bacteria) or many cells (like a\nhuman), is called an organism. Thus, cells are the basic building blocks of all organisms.\nSeveral cells of one kind that interconnect with each other and perform a shared function form a tissue; several tissues\ncombine to form an organ (your stomach, heart, or brain), and several organs make up an organ system (such as the digestive\nsystem, circulatory system, or nervous system). Several systems that function together form an organism (like a human\nbeing). Here, we will examine the structure and function of cells.\nThere are many types of cells, all grouped into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. For example,\nboth animal and plant cells are classified as eukaryotic cells, whereas bacterial cells are classified as prokaryotic. Before\ndiscussing the criteria for determining whether a cell is prokaryotic or eukaryotic, let\u2019s first examine how biologists study\ncells.\nMicroscopy\nCells vary in size. With few exceptions, individual cells cannot be seen with the naked eye, so scientists use microscopes\n(micro- = \u201csmall\u201d; -scope = \u201cto look at\u201d) to study them. A microscope is an instrument that magnifies an object. Most\nphotographs of cells are taken with a microscope, and these images can also be called micrographs.\nThe optics of a compound microscope\u2019s lenses change the orientation of the image that the user sees. A specimen that\nis right-side up and facing right on the microscope slide will appear upside-down and facing left when viewed through a\nmicroscope, and vice versa. Similarly, if the slide is moved left while looking through the microscope, it will appear to\nmove right, and if moved down, it will seem to move up. This occurs because microscopes use two sets of lenses to magnify\nthe image. Because of the manner by which light travels through the lenses, this system of two lenses produces an inverted\nimage (binocular, or dissecting microscopes, work in a similar manner, but include an additional magnification system that\nmakes the final image appear to be upright).\nLight Microscopes\nTo give you a sense of cell size, a typical human red blood cell is about eight millionths of a meter or eight micrometers\n(abbreviated as eight \u03bcm) in diameter; the head of a pin of is about two thousandths of a meter (two mm) in diameter. That\nmeans about 250 red blood cells could fit on the head of a pin.\nMost student microscopes are classified as light microscopes (Figure 4.2a). Visible light passes and is bent through the\nlens system to enable the user to see the specimen. Light microscopes are advantageous for viewing living organisms, but\nsince individual cells are generally transparent, their components are not distinguishable unless they are colored with special\nstains. Staining, however, usually kills the cells.\nLight microscopes commonly used in the undergraduate college laboratory magnify up to approximately 400 times. Two\nparameters that are important in microscopy are magnification and resolving power. Magnification is the process of\nenlarging an object in appearance. Resolving power is the ability of a microscope to distinguish two adjacent structures as\nseparate: the higher the resolution, the better the clarity and detail of the image. When oil immersion lenses are used for the\nstudy of small objects, magnification is usually increased to 1,000 times. In order to gain a better understanding of cellular\nstructure and function, scientists typically use electron microscopes.\n148\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 4.2 (a) Most light microscopes used in a college biology lab can magnify cells up to approximately 400 times\nand have a resolution of about 200 nanometers. (b) Electron microscopes provide a much higher magnification,\n100,000x, and a have a resolution of 50 picometers. (credit a: modification of work by \"GcG\"/Wikimedia Commons;\ncredit b: modification of work by Evan Bench)\nElectron Microscopes\nIn contrast to light microscopes, electron microscopes (Figure 4.2b) use a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light.\nNot only does this allow for higher magnification and, thus, more detail (Figure 4.3), it also provides higher resolving\npower. The method used to prepare the specimen for viewing with an electron microscope kills the specimen. Electrons\nhave short wavelengths (shorter than photons) that move best in a vacuum, so living cells cannot be viewed with an electron\nmicroscope.\nIn a scanning electron microscope, a beam of electrons moves back and forth across a cell\u2019s surface, creating details of cell\nsurface characteristics. In a transmission electron microscope, the electron beam penetrates the cell and provides details of a\ncell\u2019s internal structures. As you might imagine, electron microscopes are significantly more bulky and expensive than light\nmicroscopes.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.3 (a) These Salmonella bacteria appear as tiny purple dots when viewed with a light microscope. (b) This\nscanning electron microscope micrograph shows Salmonella bacteria (in red) invading human cells (yellow). Even\nthough subfigure (b) shows a different Salmonella specimen than subfigure (a), you can still observe the comparative\nincrease in magnification and detail.

Despite the limitations of his now-ancient lenses, van Leeuwenhoek\nobserved the movements of single-celled organisms, which he collectively termed \u201canimalcules.\u201d\nIn a 1665 publication called Micrographia, experimental scientist Robert Hooke coined the term \u201ccell\u201d for the box-like\nstructures he observed when viewing cork tissue through a lens. In the 1670s, van Leeuwenhoek discovered bacteria and\nprotozoa. Later advances in lenses, microscope construction, and staining techniques enabled other scientists to see some\ncomponents inside cells.\nBy the late 1830s, botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann were studying tissues and proposed the\nunified cell theory, which states that all living things are composed of one or more cells, the cell is the basic unit of life,\nand new cells arise from existing cells. Rudolf Virchow later made important contributions to this theory.\n150\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nHave you ever heard of a medical test called a Pap smear (Figure 4.4)? In this test, a doctor takes a small\nsample of cells from the uterine cervix of a patient and sends it to a medical lab where a cytotechnologist\nstains the cells and examines them for any changes that could indicate abnormal cell growth or a microbial\ninfection.\nCytotechnologists (cyto- = \u201ccell\u201d) are professionals who study cells via microscopic examinations and other\nlaboratory tests. They are trained to determine which cellular changes are within normal limits and which\nare abnormal.

Often too small to be seen without a microscope, cells come in all sizes and shapes, and their small size allows\nfor a large surface area-to-volume ratio that enables a more efficient exchange of nutrients and wastes with the environment.\nThere are three basic types of cells: archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. Both archaea and bacteria are classified as\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\n151\nprokaryotes, whereas cells of animals, plants, fungi, and protists are eukaryotes. Archaea are a unique group of organisms\nand likely evolved in the harsh conditions of early Earth and are still prevalent today in extreme environments, such as hot\nsprings and polar regions. All cells share features that reflect their evolution from a common ancestor; these features are 1)\na plasma membrane that separates the cell from its environment; 2) cytoplasm comprising the jelly-like cytosol inside the\ncell; 3) ribosomes that are important for the synthesis of proteins, and 4) DNA to store and transmit hereditary information.\nProkaryotes may also have a cell wall that acts as an extra layer of protection against the external environment. The term\n\u201cprokaryote\u201d means \u201cbefore nucleus,\u201d and prokaryotes do not have nuclei. Rather, their DNA exists as a single circular\nchromosome in the central part of the cell called the nucleoid. Some bacterial cells also have circular DNA plasmids that\noften carry genes for resistance to antibiotics (Chapter 17). Other common prokaryotic cell features include flagella and pili.\nThe content presented in this section supports the learning objectives outlined in Big Idea 1 and Big Idea 2 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework. The AP\u00ae Learning Objectives merge essential knowledge content with one or more of the\nseven Science Practices. These objectives provide a transparent foundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, along with inquiry-\nbased laboratory experiences, instructional activities, and AP\u00ae exam questions.\nBig Idea 1\nThe process of evolution drives the diversity and unity of life.\nEnduring\nUnderstanding\n1.D\nThe origin of living systems is explained by natural processes.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n1.D.2 Scientific evidence from many different disciplines supports models of the origin of\nlife.\nScience\nPractice\n4.1 The student can justify the selection of the kind of data needed to answer a particular\nscientific question.\nLearning\nObjective\n1.32 The student is able to justify the selection of geological, physical, chemical, and\nbiological data that reveal early Earth conditions.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n2.A.3 Organisms must exchange matter with the environment to grow, reproduce and\nmaintain organization.\nScience\nPractice\n2.2 The student can apply mathematical routines to quantities that describe natural\nphenomena.\nLearning\nObjective\n2.6 The student is able to use calculated surface area-to-volume ratios to predict which\ncell(s) might eliminate wastes or procure nutrients faster by diffusion.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n2.A.3 Organisms must exchange matter with the environment to grow, reproduce and\nmaintain organization.\nScience\nPractice\n6.2 The student can construct explanations of phenomena based on evidence produced\nthrough scientific practices.\nLearning\nObjective\n2.7 The student will be able to explain how cell sizes and shapes affect the overall rate of\nnutrient intake and the rate of waste elimination.\nCells fall into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Only the predominantly single-celled organisms\nof the domains Bacteria and Archaea are classified as prokaryotes (pro- = \u201cbefore\u201d; -kary- = \u201cnucleus\u201d). Cells of animals,\nplants, fungi, and protists are all eukaryotes (eu- = \u201ctrue\u201d) and have a nucleus.\nComponents of Prokaryotic Cells\nAll cells share four common components: 1) a plasma membrane, an outer covering that separates the cell\u2019s interior from its\nsurrounding environment; 2) cytoplasm, consisting of a jelly-like cytosol within the cell in which other cellular components\nare found; 3) DNA, the genetic material of the cell; and 4) ribosomes, which synthesize proteins. However, prokaryotes\ndiffer from eukaryotic cells in several ways.\nA prokaryote is a simple, single-celled (unicellular) organism that lacks a nucleus, or any other membrane-bound organelle.\nWe will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes. Prokaryotic DNA is found in a central part of\nthe cell: the nucleoid (Figure 4.5).\n152\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 4.5 This figure shows the generalized structure of a prokaryotic cell. All prokaryotes have chromosomal DNA\nlocalized in a nucleoid, ribosomes, a cell membrane, and a cell wall. The other structures shown are present in some,\nbut not all, bacteria.\nWhile the Earth is approximately 4.6 billion years old, the earliest fossil evidence for life are of microbial\nmats that date back to 3.5 billion years.\nWhat type of evidence for life was most likely found in a 3.5 billion year old rock?\na.\nScientists found bones buried in the rock that resemble bones of living animals.\nb.\nDead cells buried in the rock superficially resemble living prokaryotic cells.\nc.\nThe fossil superficially resembles living microbial mats that exist today.\nd.\nScientists found fossilized prokaryotic cells in the rock that are able to grow and divide.\nMost prokaryotes have a peptidoglycan cell wall and many have a polysaccharide capsule (Figure 4.5). The cell wall acts\nas an extra layer of protection, helps the cell maintain its shape, and prevents dehydration. The capsule enables the cell to\nattach to surfaces in its environment. Some prokaryotes have flagella, pili, or fimbriae. Flagella are used for locomotion.\nPili are used to exchange genetic material during a type of reproduction called conjugation. Fimbriae are used by bacteria\nto attach to a host cell.\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\n153\nMicrobiologist\nThe most effective action anyone can take to prevent the spread of contagious illnesses is to wash his or\nher hands. Why? Because microbes (organisms so tiny that they can only be seen with microscopes) are\nubiquitous. They live on doorknobs, money, your hands, and many other surfaces. If someone sneezes\ninto his hand and touches a doorknob, and afterwards you touch that same doorknob, the microbes from\nthe sneezer\u2019s mucus are now on your hands. If you touch your hands to your mouth, nose, or eyes, those\nmicrobes can enter your body and could make you sick.\nHowever, not all microbes (also called microorganisms) cause disease; most are actually beneficial. You\nhave microbes in your gut that make vitamin K.\nMicrobiologists are scientists who study microbes. Microbiologists can pursue a number of careers. Not only\ndo they work in the food industry, they are also employed in the veterinary and medical fields. They can work\nin the pharmaceutical sector, serving key roles in research and development by identifying new sources of\nantibiotics that could be used to treat bacterial infections.\nEnvironmental microbiologists may look for new ways to use specially selected or genetically engineered\nmicrobes for the removal of pollutants from soil or groundwater, as well as hazardous elements from\ncontaminated sites. These uses of microbes are called bioremediation technologies. Microbiologists can\nalso work in the field of bioinformatics, providing specialized knowledge and insight for the design,\ndevelopment, and specificity of computer models of, for example, bacterial epidemics.\nCell Size\nAt 0.1 to 5.0 \u03bcm in diameter, prokaryotic cells are significantly smaller than eukaryotic cells, which have diameters ranging\nfrom 10 to 100 \u03bcm (Figure 4.6). The small size of prokaryotes allows ions and organic molecules that enter them to quickly\ndiffuse to other parts of the cell. Similarly, any wastes produced within a prokaryotic cell can quickly diffuse out. This is\nnot the case in eukaryotic cells, which have developed different structural adaptations to enhance intracellular transport.\nFigure 4.6 This figure shows relative sizes of microbes on a logarithmic scale (recall that each unit of increase in a\nlogarithmic scale represents a 10-fold increase in the quantity being measured).\nSmall size, in general, is necessary for all cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Let\u2019s examine why that is so. First,\nwe\u2019ll consider the area and volume of a typical cell. Not all cells are spherical in shape, but most tend to approximate a\n154\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nsphere. You may remember from your high school geometry course that the formula for the surface area of a sphere is\n4\u03c0r2, while the formula for its volume is 4\u03c0r3/3. Thus, as the radius of a cell increases, its surface area increases as the\nsquare of its radius, but its volume increases as the cube of its radius (much more rapidly). Therefore, as a cell increases\nin size, its surface area-to-volume ratio decreases. This same principle would apply if the cell had the shape of a cube (see\nthis figure). If the cell grows too large, the plasma membrane will not have sufficient surface area to support the rate of\ndiffusion required for the increased volume. In other words, as a cell grows, it becomes less efficient. One way to become\nmore efficient is to divide; another way is to develop organelles that perform specific tasks. These adaptations lead to the\ndevelopment of more sophisticated cells called eukaryotic cells.\nBesides the volume of the cell, the size of the cell is also important for survival. As mentioned before, most cells are\napproximately spherical in shape. This is because a sphere is the shape with the largest surface area-to-volume ratio. As\nnutrients diffuse into the cell, a sphere is the shape where nutrients would have to travel the least distance to reach the center.\nThis is important because nutrients and wastes are always exchanged at the periphery of the cell. The shorter the distance\nthese nutrients and wastes have to travel, the faster the exchange of these molecules are.\nFigure 4.7 Notice that as a cell increases in size, its surface area-to-volume ratio decreases. When there is\ninsufficient surface area to support a cell\u2019s increasing volume, a cell will either divide or die. The cell on the left\nhas a volume of 1 mm3 and a surface area of 6 mm2, with a surface area-to-volume ratio of 6 to 1, whereas the\ncell on the right has a volume of 8 mm3 and a surface area of 24 mm2, with a surface area-to-volume ratio of 3 to\n1.\nOn average, prokaryotic cells are smaller than eukaryotic cells. What are some advantages to small cell size? What are\nsome advantages to large cell size?\na.\nSmall, prokaryotic cells do not expend energy in intracellular transport of substances. Larger eukaryotic cells\nhave organelles, which enable them to produce complex substances.\nb.\nSmall, prokaryotic cells easily escape the spontaneous changes in environmental conditions. Large,\neukaryotic cells have complex mechanisms to cope with such changes.\nc.\nSmall, prokaryotic cells divide at a higher rate. Large, eukaryotic cells show division with genetic variations.\nd.\nSmall, prokaryotic cells have fewer phospholipids in their membrane. Large, eukaryotic cells have more\ntransport proteins in their phospholipid bilayer, supporting efficient transport of molecules.\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\n155\nActivity\nCreate an annotated diagram to explain how approximately 300 million alveoli in a human lung increases\nsurface area for gas exchange to the size of a tennis court.

Like prokaryotes, all eukaryotic cells have a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and DNA. Many organelles\nare bound by membranes composed of phospholipid bilayers embedded with proteins to compartmentalize functions such\nas the storage of hydrolytic enzymes and the synthesis of proteins. The nucleus houses DNA, and the nucleolus within the\nnucleus is the site of ribosome assembly. Functional ribosomes are found either free in the cytoplasm or attached to the\nrough endoplasmic reticulum where they perform protein synthesis. The Golgi apparatus receives, modifies, and packages\nsmall molecules like lipids and proteins for distribution. Mitochondria and chloroplasts participate in free energy capture\nand transfer through the processes of cellular respiration and photosynthesis, respectively. Peroxisomes oxidize fatty acids\nand amino acids, and they are equipped to break down hydrogen peroxide formed from these reactions without letting it\ninto the cytoplasm where it can cause damage. Vesicles and vacuoles store substances, and in plant cells, the central vacuole\nstores pigments, salts, minerals, nutrients, proteins, and degradation enzymes and helps maintain rigidity. In contrast, animal\ncells have centrosomes and lysosomes but lack cell walls.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined in\nBig Idea 1, Big Idea 2, and Big Idea 4 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework.

Many organelles\nare bound by membranes composed of phospholipid bilayers embedded with proteins to compartmentalize functions such\nas the storage of hydrolytic enzymes and the synthesis of proteins. The nucleus houses DNA, and the nucleolus within the\nnucleus is the site of ribosome assembly. Functional ribosomes are found either free in the cytoplasm or attached to the\nrough endoplasmic reticulum where they perform protein synthesis. The Golgi apparatus receives, modifies, and packages\nsmall molecules like lipids and proteins for distribution. Mitochondria and chloroplasts participate in free energy capture\nand transfer through the processes of cellular respiration and photosynthesis, respectively. Peroxisomes oxidize fatty acids\nand amino acids, and they are equipped to break down hydrogen peroxide formed from these reactions without letting it\ninto the cytoplasm where it can cause damage. Vesicles and vacuoles store substances, and in plant cells, the central vacuole\nstores pigments, salts, minerals, nutrients, proteins, and degradation enzymes and helps maintain rigidity. In contrast, animal\ncells have centrosomes and lysosomes but lack cell walls.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined in\nBig Idea 1, Big Idea 2, and Big Idea 4 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 1.15] [APLO 2.5][APLO 2.25][APLO 1.16]\nHave you ever heard the phrase \u201cform follows function?\u201d It\u2019s a philosophy practiced in many industries. In architecture,\nthis means that buildings should be constructed to support the activities that will be carried out inside them. For example,\na skyscraper should be built with several elevator banks; a hospital should be built so that its emergency room is easily\naccessible.\nOur natural world also utilizes the principle of form following function, especially in cell biology, and this will become clear\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\n157\nas we explore eukaryotic cells (Figure 4.8). Unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells have: 1) a membrane-bound nucleus;\n2) numerous membrane-bound organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, chloroplasts, mitochondria,\nand others; and 3) several, rod-shaped chromosomes. Because a eukaryotic cell\u2019s nucleus is surrounded by a membrane, it is\noften said to have a \u201ctrue nucleus.\u201d The word \u201corganelle\u201d means \u201clittle organ,\u201d and, as already mentioned, organelles have\nspecialized cellular functions, just as the organs of your body have specialized functions.\nAt this point, it should be clear to you that eukaryotic cells have a more complex structure than prokaryotic cells. Organelles\nallow different functions to be compartmentalized in different areas of the cell. Before turning to organelles, let\u2019s first\nexamine two important components of the cell: the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm.\n158\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.8 These figures show the major organelles and other cell components of (a) a typical animal cell\nand (b) a typical eukaryotic plant cell. The plant cell has a cell wall, chloroplasts, plastids, and a central\nvacuole\u2014structures not found in animal cells. Most plant cells do not have lysosomes or centrosomes.\nIf the nucleolus were not able to carry out its function, what other cellular organelles would be affected?\na.\nThe structure of endoplasmic reticulum would not form.\nb.\nThe function of lysosomes would be hindered, as hydrolases are formed by nucleolus.\nc.\nThe free ribosomes and the rough endoplasmic reticulum, which contains ribosomes, would not form.\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\n159\nd.\nThe Golgi apparatus will not be able to sort proteins properly.\nThe Plasma Membrane\nLike prokaryotes, eukaryotic cells have a plasma membrane (Figure 4.9), a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins\nthat separates the internal contents of the cell from its surrounding environment. A phospholipid is a lipid molecule with\ntwo fatty acid chains and a phosphate-containing group. The plasma membrane controls the passage of organic molecules,\nions, water, and oxygen into and out of the cell. Wastes (such as carbon dioxide and ammonia) also leave the cell by passing\nthrough the plasma membrane.\nFigure 4.9 The eukaryotic plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer with proteins and cholesterol embedded in it.\nThe plasma membranes of cells that specialize in absorption are folded into fingerlike projections called microvilli (singular\n= microvillus); (Figure 4.10). Such cells are typically found lining the small intestine, the organ that absorbs nutrients\nfrom digested food. This is an excellent example of form following function. People with celiac disease have an immune\nresponse to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. The immune response damages microvilli, and thus,\nafflicted individuals cannot absorb nutrients. This leads to malnutrition, cramping, and diarrhea. Patients suffering from\nceliac disease must follow a gluten-free diet.\nFigure 4.10 Microvilli, shown here as they appear on cells lining the small intestine, increase the surface area available\nfor absorption. These microvilli are only found on the area of the plasma membrane that faces the cavity from which\nsubstances will be absorbed. (credit \"micrograph\": modification of work by Louisa Howard)\nThe Cytoplasm\nThe cytoplasm is the entire region of a cell between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope (a structure to be\ndiscussed shortly). It is made up of organelles suspended in the gel-like cytosol, the cytoskeleton, and various chemicals\n(Figure 4.8). Even though the cytoplasm consists of 70 to 80 percent water, it has a semi-solid consistency, which comes\nfrom the proteins within it. However, proteins are not the only organic molecules found in the cytoplasm. Glucose and other\n160\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nsimple sugars, polysaccharides, amino acids, nucleic acids, fatty acids, and derivatives of glycerol are found there, too. Ions\nof sodium, potassium, calcium, and many other elements are also dissolved in the cytoplasm. Many metabolic reactions,\nincluding protein synthesis, take place in the cytoplasm.\nThe Nucleus\nTypically, the nucleus is the most prominent organelle in a cell (Figure 4.8). The nucleus (plural = nuclei) houses the cell\u2019s\nDNA and directs the synthesis of ribosomes and proteins. Let\u2019s look at it in more detail (Figure 4.11).\nFigure 4.11 The nucleus stores chromatin (DNA plus proteins) in a gel-like substance called the nucleoplasm. The\nnucleolus is a condensed region of chromatin where ribosome synthesis occurs. The boundary of the nucleus is\ncalled the nuclear envelope. It consists of two phospholipid bilayers: an outer membrane and an inner membrane. The\nnuclear membrane is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum. Nuclear pores allow substances to enter and exit the\nnucleus.\nThe Nuclear Envelope\nThe nuclear envelope is a double-membrane structure that constitutes the outermost portion of the nucleus (Figure 4.11).\nBoth the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope are phospholipid bilayers.\nThe nuclear envelope is punctuated with pores that control the passage of ions, molecules, and RNA between the\nnucleoplasm and cytoplasm. The nucleoplasm is the semi-solid fluid inside the nucleus, where we find the chromatin and\nthe nucleolus.\nChromatin and Chromosomes\nTo understand chromatin, it is helpful to first consider chromosomes. Chromosomes are structures within the nucleus that\nare made up of DNA, the hereditary material. You may remember that in prokaryotes, DNA is organized into a single\ncircular chromosome. In eukaryotes, chromosomes are linear structures. Every eukaryotic species has a specific number of\nchromosomes in the nucleus of each cell. For example, in humans, the chromosome number is 46, while in fruit flies, it is\neight. Chromosomes are only visible and distinguishable from one another when the cell is getting ready to divide. When the\ncell is in the growth and maintenance phases of its life cycle, proteins are attached to chromosomes, and they resemble an\nunwound, jumbled bunch of threads. These unwound protein-chromosome complexes are called chromatin (Figure 4.12);\nchromatin describes the material that makes up the chromosomes both when condensed and decondensed.\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\n161\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.12 (a) This image shows various levels of the organization of chromatin (DNA and protein). (b) This image\nshows paired chromosomes. (credit b: modification of work by NIH; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nThe Nucleolus\nWe already know that the nucleus directs the synthesis of ribosomes, but how does it do this? Some chromosomes have\nsections of DNA that encode ribosomal RNA. A darkly staining area within the nucleus called the nucleolus (plural\n= nucleoli) aggregates the ribosomal RNA with associated proteins to assemble the ribosomal subunits that are then\ntransported out through the pores in the nuclear envelope to the cytoplasm.\nRibosomes\nRibosomes are the cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis. When viewed through an electron microscope,\nribosomes appear either as clusters (polyribosomes) or single, tiny dots that float freely in the cytoplasm. They may be\nattached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane or the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum and the\nouter membrane of the nuclear envelope (Figure 4.8). Electron microscopy has shown us that ribosomes, which are large\ncomplexes of protein and RNA, consist of two subunits, aptly called large and small (Figure 4.13). Ribosomes receive their\n\u201corders\u201d for protein synthesis from the nucleus where the DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA\ntravels to the ribosomes, which translate the code provided by the sequence of the nitrogenous bases in the mRNA into a\nspecific order of amino acids in a protein. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.\nFigure 4.13 Ribosomes are made up of a large subunit (top) and a small subunit (bottom). During protein synthesis,\nribosomes assemble amino acids into proteins.\nBecause protein synthesis is an essential function of all cells (including enzymes, hormones, antibodies, pigments, structural\ncomponents, and surface receptors), ribosomes are found in practically every cell. Ribosomes are particularly abundant\nin cells that synthesize large amounts of protein. For example, the pancreas is responsible for creating several digestive\nenzymes and the cells that produce these enzymes contain many ribosomes. Thus, we see another example of form\nfollowing function.\n162\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nMitochondria\nMitochondria (singular = mitochondrion) are often called the \u201cpowerhouses\u201d or \u201cenergy factories\u201d of a cell because they\nare responsible for making adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell\u2019s main energy-carrying molecule. ATP represents the\nshort-term stored energy of the cell. Cellular respiration is the process of making ATP using the chemical energy found in\nglucose and other nutrients. In mitochondria, this process uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. In\nfact, the carbon dioxide that you exhale with every breath comes from the cellular reactions that produce carbon dioxide as\na byproduct.\nIn keeping with our theme of form following function, it is important to point out that muscle cells have a very high\nconcentration of mitochondria that produce ATP. Your muscle cells need a lot of energy to keep your body moving. When\nyour cells don\u2019t get enough oxygen, they do not make a lot of ATP. Instead, the small amount of ATP they make in the\nabsence of oxygen is accompanied by the production of lactic acid.\nMitochondria are oval-shaped, double membrane organelles (Figure 4.14) that have their own ribosomes and DNA. Each\nmembrane is a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins. The inner layer has folds called cristae. The area surrounded\nby the folds is called the mitochondrial matrix. The cristae and the matrix have different roles in cellular respiration.\nFigure 4.14 This electron micrograph shows a mitochondrion as viewed with a transmission electron microscope. This\norganelle has an outer membrane and an inner membrane. The inner membrane contains folds, called cristae, which\nincrease its surface area. The space between the two membranes is called the intermembrane space, and the space\ninside the inner membrane is called the mitochondrial matrix. ATP synthesis takes place on the inner membrane.\n(credit: modification of work by Matthew Britton; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nPeroxisomes\nPeroxisomes are small, round organelles enclosed by single membranes. They carry out oxidation reactions that break\ndown fatty acids and amino acids. They also detoxify many poisons that may enter the body. (Many of these oxidation\nreactions release hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, which would be damaging to cells; however, when these reactions are confined\nto peroxisomes, enzymes safely break down the H2O2 into oxygen and water.) Glyoxysomes, which are specialized\nperoxisomes in plants, are responsible for converting stored fats into sugars.\nVesicles and Vacuoles\nVesicles and vacuoles are membrane-bound sacs that function in storage and transport. Other than the fact that vacuoles are\nsomewhat larger than vesicles, there is a very subtle distinction between them: The membranes of vesicles can fuse with\neither the plasma membrane or other membrane systems within the cell. Additionally, some agents such as enzymes within\nplant vacuoles break down macromolecules. The membrane of a vacuole does not fuse with the membranes of other cellular\ncomponents.\nAnimal Cells versus Plant Cells\nAt this point, you know that each eukaryotic cell has a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, a nucleus, ribosomes, mitochondria,\nperoxisomes, and in some, vacuoles, but there are some striking differences between animal and plant cells. While both\nanimal and plant cells have microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs), animal cells also have centrioles associated with the\nMTOC: a complex called the centrosome. Animal cells each have a centrosome and lysosomes, whereas most plant cells\ndo not. Plant cells have a cell wall, chloroplasts and other specialized plastids, and a large central vacuole, whereas animal\ncells do not.\nThe Centrosome\nThe centrosome is a microtubule-organizing center found near the nuclei of animal cells. It contains a pair of centrioles,\ntwo structures that lie perpendicular to each other (Figure 4.15). Each centriole is a cylinder of nine triplets of microtubules.\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\n163\nFigure 4.15 The centrosome consists of two centrioles that lie at right angles to each other. Each centriole is a cylinder\nmade up of nine triplets of microtubules. Nontubulin proteins (indicated by the green lines) hold the microtubule triplets\ntogether.\nThe centrosome (the organelle where all microtubules originate) replicates itself before a cell divides, and the centrioles\nappear to have some role in pulling the duplicated chromosomes to opposite ends of the dividing cell. However, the exact\nfunction of the centrioles in cell division isn\u2019t clear, because cells that have had the centrosome removed can still divide,\nand plant cells, which lack centrosomes, are capable of cell division.\nLysosomes\nAnimal cells have another set of organelles not found in most plant cells: lysosomes. The lysosomes are the cell\u2019s \u201cgarbage\ndisposal.\u201d In plant cells, the digestive processes take place in vacuoles. Enzymes within the lysosomes aid the breakdown of\nproteins, polysaccharides, lipids, nucleic acids, and even worn-out organelles. These enzymes are active at a much lower pH\nthan that of the cytoplasm. Therefore, the pH within lysosomes is more acidic than the pH of the cytoplasm. Many reactions\nthat take place in the cytoplasm could not occur at a low pH, so again, the advantage of compartmentalizing the eukaryotic\ncell into organelles is apparent.\nThe Cell Wall\nIf you examine Figure 4.8b, the diagram of a plant cell, you will see a structure external to the plasma membrane called\nthe cell wall. The cell wall is a rigid covering that protects the cell, provides structural support, and gives shape to the cell.\nFungal and protistan cells also have cell walls. While the chief component of prokaryotic cell walls is peptidoglycan, the\nmajor organic molecule in the plant cell wall is cellulose (Figure 4.16), a polysaccharide made up of glucose units. Have\nyou ever noticed that when you bite into a raw vegetable, like celery, it crunches? That\u2019s because you are tearing the rigid\ncell walls of the celery cells with your teeth.\nFigure 4.16 Cellulose is a long chain of \u03b2-glucose molecules connected by a 1-4 linkage. The dashed lines at each\nend of the figure indicate a series of many more glucose units. The size of the page makes it impossible to portray an\nentire cellulose molecule.\nChloroplasts\nLike the mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own DNA and ribosomes, but chloroplasts have an entirely different function.\nChloroplasts are plant cell organelles that carry out photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the series of reactions that use carbon\ndioxide, water, and light energy to make glucose and oxygen. This is a major difference between plants and animals; plants\n(autotrophs) are able to make their own food, like sugars, while animals (heterotrophs) must ingest their food.\nLike mitochondria, chloroplasts have outer and inner membranes, but within the space enclosed by a chloroplast\u2019s inner\nmembrane is a set of interconnected and stacked fluid-filled membrane sacs called thylakoids (Figure 4.17). Each stack of\nthylakoids is called a granum (plural = grana). The fluid enclosed by the inner membrane that surrounds the grana is called\nthe stroma.\n164\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 4.17 The chloroplast has an outer membrane, an inner membrane, and membrane structures called thylakoids\nthat are stacked into grana. The space inside the thylakoid membranes is called the thylakoid space. The light\nharvesting reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes, and the synthesis of sugar takes place in the fluid inside\nthe inner membrane, which is called the stroma. Chloroplasts also have their own genome, which is contained on a\nsingle circular chromosome.\nThe chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll, which captures the light energy that drives the reactions of\nphotosynthesis. Like plant cells, photosynthetic protists also have chloroplasts. Some bacteria perform photosynthesis, but\ntheir chlorophyll is not relegated to an organelle.\nEndosymbiosis\nWe have mentioned that both mitochondria and chloroplasts contain DNA and ribosomes. Have you\nwondered why? Strong evidence points to endosymbiosis as the explanation.\nSymbiosis is a relationship in which organisms from two separate species depend on each other for their\nsurvival. Endosymbiosis (endo- = \u201cwithin\u201d) is a mutually beneficial relationship in which one organism lives\ninside the other. Endosymbiotic relationships abound in nature. We have already mentioned that microbes\nthat produce vitamin K live inside the human gut. This relationship is beneficial for us because we are\nunable to synthesize vitamin K. It is also beneficial for the microbes because they are protected from other\norganisms and from drying out, and they receive abundant food from the environment of the large intestine.\nScientists have long noticed that bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts are similar in size. We also know\nthat bacteria have DNA and ribosomes, just as mitochondria and chloroplasts do. Scientists believe that\nhost cells and bacteria formed an endosymbiotic relationship when the host cells ingested both aerobic and\nautotrophic bacteria (cyanobacteria) but did not destroy them. Through many millions of years of evolution,\nthese ingested bacteria became more specialized in their functions, with the aerobic bacteria becoming\nmitochondria and the autotrophic bacteria becoming chloroplasts.\nBased on what you know about plant and animals cells, which of the following events are most likely to have occurred?\na.\nA host cell that ingested aerobic bacteria gave rise to modern animals, while ancestor of that cell that also\ningested photoautotrophic bacteria that gave rise to modern plants.\nb.\nA host cell that gave rise to modern plants ingested photoautotrophic bacteria only, while a host cell that\ngave rise to modern animals ingested aerobic bacteria only.\nc.\nA host cell that gave rise to modern plants ingested both aerobic and photoautotrophic bacteria, while a host\ncell that gave rise to modern animals ingested photoautotrophic bacteria only.\nd.\nA host cell that gave rise to modern plants and animals ingested both aerobic and photoautotrophic bacteria.\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\n165\nThe Central Vacuole\nPreviously, we mentioned vacuoles as essential components of plant cells. If you look at Figure 4.8b, you will see that plant\ncells each have a large central vacuole that occupies most of the area of the cell. The central vacuole plays a key role in\nregulating the cell\u2019s concentration of water in changing environmental conditions. Have you ever noticed that if you forget\nto water a plant for a few days, it wilts? That\u2019s because as the water concentration in the soil becomes lower than the water\nconcentration in the plant, water moves out of the central vacuoles and cytoplasm. As the central vacuole shrinks, it leaves\nthe cell wall unsupported. This loss of support to the cell walls of plant cells results in the wilted appearance of the plant.\nThe central vacuole also supports the expansion of the cell. When the central vacuole holds more water, the cell gets larger\nwithout having to invest a lot of energy in synthesizing new cytoplasm.\nActivity\n\u2022\nConstruct a concept map or Venn diagram to describe the relationships that exist among the three\ndomains of life (Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya) based on cellular features.

These subcellular\ncomponents work together to modify, tag, package, and transport proteins and lipids. The rough endoplasmic reticulum\n(RER) with its attached ribosomes is the site of protein synthesis and modification. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum\n(SER) synthesizes carbohydrates, lipids including phospholipids and cholesterol, and steroid hormones; engages in the\ndetoxification of medications and poisons; and stores calcium ions. Lysosomes digest macromolecules, recycle worn-out\norganelles, and destroy pathogens. Just like your body uses different organs that work together, cells use these organelles\ninteract to perform specific functions. For example, proteins that are synthesized in the RER then travel to the Golgi\napparatus for modification and packaging for either storage or transport. If these proteins are hydrolytic enzymes, they can\nbe stored in lysosomes. Mitochondria produce the energy needed for these processes. This functional flow through several\norganelles, a process which is dependent on energy produced by yet another organelle, serves as a hallmark illustration of\nthe cell\u2019s complex, interconnected dependence on its organelles.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined in\nBig Idea 2 and Big Idea 4 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework. The Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum\nFramework provide a transparent foundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience,\ninstructional activities, and AP\u00ae exam questions.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 4.6]\nThe Endoplasmic Reticulum\nThe endomembrane system (endo = \u201cwithin\u201d) is a group of membranes and organelles (Figure 4.18) in eukaryotic cells\nthat works together to modify, package, and transport lipids and proteins. It includes the nuclear envelope, lysosomes, and\nvesicles, which we\u2019ve already mentioned, and the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, which we will cover shortly.\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\n167\nAlthough not technically within the cell, the plasma membrane is included in the endomembrane system because, as you will\nsee, it interacts with the other endomembranous organelles. The endomembrane system does not include the membranes of\neither mitochondria or chloroplasts.\nFigure 4.18 Membrane and secretory proteins are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The\nRER also sometimes modifies proteins. In this illustration, a (green) integral membrane protein in the ER is\nmodified by attachment of a (purple) carbohydrate. Vesicles with the integral protein bud from the ER and fuse\nwith the cis face of the Golgi apparatus. As the protein passes along the Golgi\u2019s cisternae, it is further modified\nby the addition of more carbohydrates. After its synthesis is complete, it exits as an integral membrane protein\nof the vesicles that bud from the Golgi\u2019s trans face. When the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane, the protein\nbecomes an integral portion of that cell membrane. (credit: modification of work by Magnus Manske)\nIf a peripheral membrane protein were synthesized inside the lumen of the ER, would it end up on the inside or outside\nof the plasma membrane?\na.\nThe vesicle travels from the endoplasmic reticulum to get embedded in plasma membrane.\nb.\nThe vesicle travels from the Golgi to the plasma membrane to release the protein outside.\nc.\nThe vesicle travels from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane, and returns to the Golgi\napparatus to get modified.\nd.\nThe vesicle moves from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasmic area, remaining there.\n168\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Figure 4.18) is a series of interconnected membranous sacs and tubules that collectively\nmodifies proteins and synthesizes lipids. However, these two functions are performed in separate areas of the ER: the rough\nER and the smooth ER, respectively.\nThe hollow portion of the ER tubules is called the lumen or cisternal space. The membrane of the ER, which is a\nphospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins, is continuous with the nuclear envelope.\nRough ER\nThe rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) is so named because the ribosomes attached to its cytoplasmic surface give it a\nstudded appearance when viewed through an electron microscope (Figure 4.19).\nFigure 4.19 This transmission electron micrograph shows the rough endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles in a\npancreatic cell. (credit: modification of work by Louisa Howard)\nRibosomes transfer their newly synthesized proteins into the lumen of the RER where they undergo structural modifications,\nsuch as folding or the acquisition of side chains. These modified proteins will be incorporated into cellular membranes\u2014the\nmembrane of the ER or those of other organelles\u2014or secreted from the cell (such as protein hormones, enzymes). The RER\nalso makes phospholipids for cellular membranes.\nIf the phospholipids or modified proteins are not destined to stay in the RER, they will reach their destinations via transport\nvesicles that bud from the RER\u2019s membrane (Figure 4.18).\nSince the RER is engaged in modifying proteins (such as enzymes, for example) that will be secreted from the cell, you\nwould be correct in assuming that the RER is abundant in cells that secrete proteins. This is the case with cells of the liver,\nfor example.\nSmooth ER\nThe smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) is continuous with the RER but has few or no ribosomes on its cytoplasmic\nsurface (Figure 4.18). Functions of the SER include synthesis of carbohydrates, lipids, and steroid hormones; detoxification\nof medications and poisons; and storage of calcium ions.\nIn muscle cells, a specialized SER called the sarcoplasmic reticulum is responsible for storage of the calcium ions that are\nneeded to trigger the coordinated contractions of the muscle cells.\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\n169\nYou can watch an excellent animation of the endomembrane system here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/endomembrane)\n.\nHow do the nucleus and the endomembrane system work together for protein synthesis?\na.\nThe endomembrane system processes and ships proteins specified by the nucleus.

The ribosomes on the smooth\nER use the RNA to create the different types of protein needed by the body.\nCardiologist\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. This is primarily due to our sedentary\nlifestyle and our high trans-fat diets.\nHeart failure is just one of many disabling heart conditions. Heart failure does not mean that the heart has\nstopped working. Rather, it means that the heart can\u2019t pump with sufficient force to transport oxygenated\nblood to all the vital organs. Left untreated, heart failure can lead to kidney failure and failure of other organs.\nThe wall of the heart is composed of cardiac muscle tissue. Heart failure occurs when the endoplasmic\nreticula of cardiac muscle cells do not function properly. As a result, an insufficient number of calcium ions\nare available to trigger a sufficient contractile force.\nCardiologists (cardi- = \u201cheart\u201d; -ologist = \u201cone who studies\u201d) are doctors who specialize in treating heart\ndiseases, including heart failure. Cardiologists can make a diagnosis of heart failure via physical\nexamination, results from an electrocardiogram (ECG, a test that measures the electrical activity of the\nheart), a chest X-ray to see whether the heart is enlarged, and other tests. If heart failure is diagnosed, the\ncardiologist will typically prescribe appropriate medications and recommend a reduction in table salt intake\nand a supervised exercise program.\nThe Golgi Apparatus\nWe have already mentioned that vesicles can bud from the ER and transport their contents elsewhere, but where do the\nvesicles go? Before reaching their final destination, the lipids or proteins within the transport vesicles still need to be sorted,\npackaged, and tagged so that they wind up in the right place. Sorting, tagging, packaging, and distribution of lipids and\nproteins takes place in the Golgi apparatus (also called the Golgi body), a series of flattened membranes (Figure 4.20).\n170\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 4.20 The Golgi apparatus in this white blood cell is visible as a stack of semicircular, flattened rings in the lower\nportion of the image. Several vesicles can be seen near the Golgi apparatus. (credit: modification of work by Louisa\nHoward)\nThe receiving side of the Golgi apparatus is called the cis face. The opposite side is called the trans face. The transport\nvesicles that formed from the ER travel to the cis face, fuse with it, and empty their contents into the lumen of the Golgi\napparatus. As the proteins and lipids travel through the Golgi, they undergo further modifications that allow them to be\nsorted. The most frequent modification is the addition of short chains of sugar molecules. These newly modified proteins\nand lipids are then tagged with phosphate groups or other small molecules so that they can be routed to their proper\ndestinations.\nFinally, the modified and tagged proteins are packaged into secretory vesicles that bud from the trans face of the Golgi.\nWhile some of these vesicles deposit their contents into other parts of the cell where they will be used, other secretory\nvesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents outside the cell.\nIn another example of form following function, cells that engage in a great deal of secretory activity (such as cells of the\nsalivary glands that secrete digestive enzymes or cells of the immune system that secrete antibodies) have an abundance of\nGolgi.\nIn plant cells, the Golgi apparatus has the additional role of synthesizing polysaccharides, some of which are incorporated\ninto the cell wall and some of which are used in other parts of the cell.\nGeneticist\nMany diseases arise from genetic mutations that prevent the synthesis of critical proteins. One such disease\nis Lowe disease (also called oculocerebrorenal syndrome, because it affects the eyes, brain, and kidneys).\nIn Lowe disease, there is a deficiency in an enzyme localized to the Golgi apparatus. Children with Lowe\ndisease are born with cataracts, typically develop kidney disease after the first year of life, and may have\nimpaired mental abilities.\nLowe disease is a genetic disease caused by a mutation on the X chromosome. The X chromosome is one\nof the two human sex chromosomes, as these chromosomes determine a person's sex. Females possess\ntwo X chromosomes while males possess one X and one Y chromosome. In females, the genes on only\none of the two X chromosomes are expressed. Females who carry the Lowe disease gene on one of their\nX chromosomes are carriers and do not show symptoms of the disease. However, males only have one X\nchromosome and the genes on this chromosome are always expressed. Therefore, males will always have\nLowe disease if their X chromosome carries the Lowe disease gene. The location of the mutated gene, as\nwell as the locations of many other mutations that cause genetic diseases, has now been identified. Through\nprenatal testing, a woman can find out if the fetus she is carrying may be afflicted with one of several genetic\ndiseases.\nGeneticists analyze the results of prenatal genetic tests and may counsel pregnant women on available\noptions. They may also conduct genetic research that leads to new drugs or foods, or perform DNA analyses\nthat are used in forensic investigations.\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\n171\nLysosomes\nIn addition to their role as the digestive component and organelle-recycling facility of animal cells, lysosomes are\nconsidered to be parts of the endomembrane system. Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to destroy pathogens\n(disease-causing organisms) that might enter the cell. A good example of this occurs in a group of white blood cells called\nmacrophages, which are part of your body\u2019s immune system. In a process known as phagocytosis or endocytosis, a section\nof the plasma membrane of the macrophage invaginates (folds in) and engulfs a pathogen. The invaginated section, with\nthe pathogen inside, then pinches itself off from the plasma membrane and becomes a vesicle. The vesicle fuses with a\nlysosome. The lysosome\u2019s hydrolytic enzymes then destroy the pathogen (Figure 4.21).\nFigure 4.21 A macrophage has engulfed (phagocytized) a potentially pathogenic bacterium which then fuses with a\nlysosome within the cell to destroy the pathogen. Other organelles are present in the cell but for simplicity are not\nshown.\nActivity\nHomemade Cell Project. Using inexpensive and common household items, create a model of a specific\neukaryotic cell (e.g., neuron, white blood cell, plant root cell, or Paramecium) that demonstrates how at least\nthree organelles work together to perform a specific function.\nThink About It\nA certain cell type functions primarily to synthesize proteins for export. What is the most likely route the newly made\nprotein takes through the cell? Justify your prediction.\nSection Summary\nThe endomembrane system includes the nuclear envelope, lysosomes, vesicles, the ER, and Golgi apparatus, as well as the\nplasma membrane. These cellular components work together to modify, package, tag, and transport proteins and lipids that\nform the membranes.\nThe RER modifies proteins and synthesizes phospholipids used in cell membranes. The SER synthesizes carbohydrates,\nlipids, and steroid hormones; engages in the detoxification of medications and poisons; and stores calcium ions. Sorting,\ntagging, packaging, and distribution of lipids and proteins take place in the Golgi apparatus. Lysosomes are created by the\nbudding of the membranes of the RER and Golgi. Lysosomes digest macromolecules, recycle worn-out organelles, and\ndestroy pathogens.\n172\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\n4.5 | Cytoskeleton\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow do the various components of the cytoskeleton perform their functions?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nAll cells, from simple bacteria to complex eukaryotes, possess a cytoskeleton composed of different types of protein\nelements, including microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules.

        "summary": "The endomembrane system in eukaryotic cells is a network of membranes and organelles\u2014including the nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, vesicles, and plasma membrane\u2014that work together to modify, package, tag, and transport proteins and lipids. The rough ER, studded with ribosomes, synthesizes and modifies proteins, while the smooth ER produces carbohydrates, lipids, and steroid hormones, detoxifies harmful substances, and stores calcium ions. Proteins and lipids from the ER are transported in vesicles to the Golgi apparatus, where they are further modified, sorted, and packaged for delivery to various destinations, including secretion from the cell. Lysosomes, formed from the ER and Golgi, contain hydrolytic enzymes to digest macromolecules, recycle cellular components, and destroy pathogens. This coordinated activity relies on energy from mitochondria and illustrates the high level of interdependence among eukaryotic organelles."

No. Within the cytoplasm, there would still be ions and organic molecules, plus a network of protein fibers that help\nmaintain the shape of the cell, secure some organelles in specific positions, allow cytoplasm and vesicles to move within\nthe cell, and enable cells within multicellular organisms to move. Collectively, this network of protein fibers is known\nas the cytoskeleton. There are three types of fibers within the cytoskeleton: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and\nmicrotubules (Figure 4.22). Here, we will examine each.\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\n173\nFigure 4.22 Microfilaments thicken the cortex around the inner edge of a cell; like rubber bands, they resist tension.\nMicrotubules are found in the interior of the cell where they maintain cell shape by resisting compressive forces.\nIntermediate filaments are found throughout the cell and hold organelles in place.\nOf the three types of protein fibers in the cytoskeleton, microfilaments are the narrowest. They function in cellular\nmovement, have a diameter of about 7 nm, and are made of two intertwined strands of a globular protein called actin (Figure\n4.23). For this reason, microfilaments are also known as actin filaments.\nFigure 4.23 Microfilaments are made of two intertwined strands of actin.\nActin is powered by ATP to assemble its filamentous form, which serves as a track for the movement of a motor protein\n174\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\ncalled myosin. This enables actin to engage in cellular events requiring motion, such as cell division in eukaryotic cells and\ncytoplasmic streaming, which is the circular movement of the cell cytoplasm in plant cells. Actin and myosin are plentiful\nin muscle cells. When your actin and myosin filaments slide past each other, your muscles contract.\nMicrofilaments also provide some rigidity and shape to the cell. They can depolymerize (disassemble) and reform quickly,\nthus enabling a cell to change its shape and move. White blood cells (your body\u2019s infection-fighting cells) make good use\nof this ability. They can move to the site of an infection and phagocytize the pathogen.\nTo see an example of a white blood cell in action, click here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/chasing_bcteria) and watch\na short time-lapse video of the cell capturing two bacteria. It engulfs one and then moves on to the other.\nThe Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infects and kills white blood cells. Over time, what affect does this have\non the body\u2019s immune system?\na.\nThe body\u2019s immune system would not be affected by this.\nb.\nThe body\u2019s immune system would not be able to fight off pathogens like bacteria with fewer white blood\ncells. This can increase the risk of illness in HIV patients.\nc.\nThe body\u2019s immune system, in order to recoup this loss, will produce more WBC\u2019s.\nd.\nThe body\u2019s immune system will fight the pathogens more vigorously in order to compensate for the fewer\nwhite blood cells.\nIntermediate Filaments\nIntermediate filaments are made of several strands of fibrous proteins that are wound together (Figure 4.24). These elements\nof the cytoskeleton get their name from the fact that their diameter, 8 to 10 nm, is between those of microfilaments and\nmicrotubules.\nFigure 4.24 Intermediate filaments consist of several intertwined strands of fibrous proteins.\nIntermediate filaments have no role in cell movement. Their function is purely structural. They bear tension, thus\nmaintaining the shape of the cell, and anchor the nucleus and other organelles in place. Figure 4.22 shows how intermediate\nfilaments create a supportive scaffolding inside the cell.\nThe intermediate filaments are the most diverse group of cytoskeletal elements. Several types of fibrous proteins are found\nin the intermediate filaments. You are probably most familiar with keratin, the fibrous protein that strengthens your hair,\nnails, and the epidermis of the skin.\nMicrotubules\nAs their name implies, microtubules are small hollow tubes. The walls of the microtubule are made of polymerized dimers\nof \u03b1-tubulin and \u03b2-tubulin, two globular proteins (Figure 4.25). With a diameter of about 25 nm, microtubules are the\nwidest components of the cytoskeleton. They help the cell resist compression, provide a track along which vesicles move\nthrough the cell, and pull replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell. Like microfilaments, microtubules\ncan disassemble and reform quickly.\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\n175\nFigure 4.25 Microtubules are hollow. Their walls consist of 13 polymerized dimers of \u03b1-tubulin and \u03b2-tubulin (right\nimage). The left image shows the molecular structure of the tube.\nMicrotubules are also the structural elements of flagella, cilia, and centrioles (the latter are the two perpendicular bodies of\nthe centrosome). In fact, in animal cells, the centrosome is the microtubule-organizing center. In eukaryotic cells, flagella\nand cilia are quite different structurally from their counterparts in prokaryotes, as discussed below.\nFlagella and Cilia\nTo refresh your memory, flagella (singular = flagellum) are long, hair-like structures that extend from the plasma membrane\nand are used to move an entire cell (for example, sperm, Euglena). When present, the cell has just one flagellum or a few\nflagella. When cilia (singular = cilium) are present, however, many of them extend along the entire surface of the plasma\nmembrane. They are short, hair-like structures that are used to move entire cells (such as paramecia) or substances along\nthe outer surface of the cell (for example, the cilia of cells lining the Fallopian tubes that move the ovum toward the uterus,\nor cilia lining the cells of the respiratory tract that trap particulate matter and move it toward your nostrils.)\nDespite their differences in length and number, flagella and cilia share a common structural arrangement of microtubules\ncalled a \u201c9 + 2 array.\u201d This is an appropriate name because a single flagellum or cilium is made of a ring of nine microtubule\ndoublets, surrounding a single microtubule doublet in the center (Figure 4.26).\nFigure 4.26 This transmission electron micrograph of two flagella shows the 9 + 2 array of microtubules: nine\nmicrotubule doublets surround a single microtubule doublet.

From narrowest to widest, they are the microfilaments\n(actin filaments), intermediate filaments, and microtubules. Microfilaments are often associated with myosin.

        "summary": "The cytoskeleton is a network of protein fibers present in all cells that maintains cell shape, secures organelles, enables intracellular transport, and facilitates cell movement. It is composed of three main types of fibers: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules. Microfilaments, the thinnest elements made of actin, work with myosin to drive cell movements such as muscle contraction, cytoplasmic streaming, and shape changes important for processes like white blood cell migration. Intermediate filaments, made of various fibrous proteins like keratin, provide structural support by bearing tension and anchoring organelles, without being involved in movement. Microtubules, the widest fibers, are hollow tubes of tubulin dimers that resist compression, serve as tracks for vesicle transport, separate chromosomes during cell division, and form the structural basis of centrioles, flagella, and cilia. Flagella are long, few in number, and move entire cells, while cilia are short, numerous, and move cells or materials along their surface, both featuring a characteristic \u201c9 + 2\u201d microtubule arrangement."

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 4.5][APLO 3.32][APLO 1.16][APLO 3.33][APLO 1.14][APLO 2.7][APLO 4.4]\nExtracellular Matrix of Animal Cells\nMost animal cells release materials into the extracellular space. The primary components of these materials are proteins,\nand the most abundant protein is collagen. Collagen fibers are interwoven with carbohydrate-containing protein molecules\ncalled proteoglycans. Collectively, these materials are called the extracellular matrix (Figure 4.27). Not only does the\nextracellular matrix hold the cells together to form a tissue, but it also allows the cells within the tissue to communicate with\neach other. How can this happen?\nFigure 4.27 The extracellular matrix consists of a network of proteins and carbohydrates.\nCells have protein receptors on the extracellular surfaces of their plasma membranes. When a molecule within the matrix\nbinds to the receptor, it changes the molecular structure of the receptor. The receptor, in turn, changes the conformation\nof the microfilaments positioned just inside the plasma membrane. These conformational changes induce chemical signals\ninside the cell that reach the nucleus and turn \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d the transcription of specific sections of DNA, which affects the\nproduction of associated proteins, thus changing the activities within the cell.\nBlood clotting provides an example of the role of the extracellular matrix in cell communication. When the cells lining a\nblood vessel are damaged, they display a protein receptor called tissue factor. When tissue factor binds with another factor\nin the extracellular matrix, it causes platelets to adhere to the wall of the damaged blood vessel, stimulates the adjacent\nsmooth muscle cells in the blood vessel to contract (thus constricting the blood vessel), and initiates a series of steps that\nstimulate the platelets to produce clotting factors.\nIntercellular Junctions\nCells can also communicate with each other via direct contact, referred to as intercellular junctions. There are some\ndifferences in the ways that plant and animal cells do this. Plasmodesmata are junctions between plant cells, whereas animal\ncell contacts include tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes.\nPlasmodesmata\nIn general, long stretches of the plasma membranes of neighboring plant cells cannot touch one another because they are\nseparated by the cell wall that surrounds each cell (Figure 4.8b). How then, can a plant transfer water and other soil nutrients\nfrom its roots, through its stems, and to its leaves? Such transport uses the vascular tissues (xylem and phloem) primarily.\nThere also exist structural modifications called plasmodesmata (singular = plasmodesma), numerous channels that pass\nbetween cell walls of adjacent plant cells, connect their cytoplasm, and enable materials to be transported from cell to cell,\nand thus throughout the plant (Figure 4.28).\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\n179\nFigure 4.28 A plasmodesma is a channel between the cell walls of two adjacent plant cells. Plasmodesmata allow\nmaterials to pass from the cytoplasm of one plant cell to the cytoplasm of an adjacent cell.\nTight Junctions\nA tight junction is a watertight seal between two adjacent animal cells (Figure 4.29). The cells are held tightly against each\nother by proteins (predominantly two proteins called claudins and occludins).\nFigure 4.29 Tight junctions form watertight connections between adjacent animal cells. Proteins create tight junction\nadherence. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nThis tight adherence prevents materials from leaking between the cells; tight junctions are typically found in epithelial\ntissues that line internal organs and cavities, and comprise most of the skin. For example, the tight junctions of the epithelial\ncells lining your urinary bladder prevent urine from leaking out into the extracellular space.\nDesmosomes\nAlso found only in animal cells are desmosomes, which act like spot welds between adjacent epithelial cells (Figure 4.30).\nShort proteins called cadherins in the plasma membrane connect to intermediate filaments to create desmosomes. The\ncadherins join two adjacent cells together and maintain the cells in a sheet-like formation in organs and tissues that stretch,\nlike the skin, heart, and muscles.\n180\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 4.30 A desmosome forms a very strong spot weld between cells. It is created by the linkage of cadherins and\nintermediate filaments. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nGap Junctions\nGap junctions in animal cells are like plasmodesmata in plant cells in that they are channels between adjacent cells that\nallow for the transport of ions, nutrients, and other substances that enable cells to communicate (Figure 4.31). Structurally,\nhowever, gap junctions and plasmodesmata differ.\nFigure 4.31 A gap junction is a protein-lined pore that allows water and small molecules to pass between adjacent\nanimal cells. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nGap junctions develop when a set of six proteins (called connexins) in the plasma membrane arrange themselves in an\nelongated donut-like configuration called a connexon. When the pores (\u201cdoughnut holes\u201d) of connexons in adjacent animal\ncells align, a channel between the two cells forms. Gap junctions are particularly important in cardiac muscle: The electrical\nsignal for the muscle to contract is passed efficiently through gap junctions, allowing the heart muscle cells to contract in\ntandem.\nChapter 4 | Cell Structure\n181\nTo conduct a virtual microscopy lab and review the parts of a cell, work through the steps of this interactive assignment\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/microscopy_lab) .\nWhat are two similarities and two differences between plant and animal cells that can be seen under a microscope?\na.\nPlant cells have cell walls which provide structure to the plant and also chloroplasts which allow for\nphotosynthesis.

The plasma membrane is selectively permeable, meaning some molecules can\nfreely enter or leave the cell. Others require help from specialized structures, other molecules, or require energy in order to\ncross. One example of a molecule that assists other molecules across the plasma membrane is a protein called NPC1. This\nprotein is involved in moving cholesterol and other types of fats across the plasma membrane. Some people have a genetic\ncondition resulting in improperly functioning NPC1. As a result, excessive cholesterol accumulates within cells causing a\ncondition called NPC Disease.\nScientists from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, and the Whitehead Institute for\nBiomedical Research discovered that the Ebola virus also uses NPC1 to hitch a ride into cells and replicate. The scientists\nused mice that lacked the NPC1 protein to test this hypothesis. When the scientists tried to infect these mice with Ebola,\nnone of the mice got sick. Then they tried to infect mice with partially functioning NPC1 and found that they got sick, but\ndid not die. In other words, without properly functioning NPC1, the Ebola virus cannot infect a mouse. If this pattern also\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\n195\nexists in humans, it means that anyone with NPC Disease and its subsequent problem with high cholesterol may also be\nprotected from Ebola.\nThe complete research report can be found here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32ebolaentry) .\n5.1 | Components and Structure\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow does the fluid mosaic model describe the structure and components of the plasma cell membrane?\n\u2022\nHow do the molecular components of the membrane provide fluidity?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nLike an art mosaic, the plasma membrane consists of several different components. Phospholipids (which we studied in\npreviously) form a bilayer; the hydrophobic, fatty acid tails are in contact with each other and hydrophilic portions of the\nphospholipids are oriented toward the aqueous internal and external environments. Several types of proteins with different\nfunctions stud the membrane. Integral proteins often span the membrane and can transport materials into or out of the cells;\nthese embedded proteins can be hydrophilic or hydrophobic, depending on their placement within the membrane. Peripheral\nproteins found on the exterior and interior surfaces of membranes can serve as enzymes, structural attachments for fibers of\nthe cytoskeleton, and part of a cell\u2019s recognition sites. These \u201ccell-specific\u201d proteins play a vital role in immune function;\nenable cells of a certain type (e.g., liver cells) to identify each other when forming a tissue; and allow hormones and other\nmolecules to recognize target cells. These proteins \u201cfloat\u201d throughout the membrane, constantly in flux.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and learning objectives outlined in\nBig Idea 2 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework. The learning objectives provide a transparent foundation for the\nAP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP\u00ae exam questions.

Cells exclude some substances, take in others, and excrete still others, all in\ncontrolled quantities. The plasma membrane must be very flexible to allow certain cells, such as red blood cells and white\nblood cells, to change shape as they pass through narrow capillaries. These are the more obvious functions of a plasma\nmembrane. In addition, the surface of the plasma membrane carries markers that allow cells to recognize one another, which\nis vital for tissue and organ formation during early development, and which later plays a role in the \u201cself\u201d versus \u201cnon-self\u201d\ndistinction of the immune response.\nAmong the most sophisticated functions of the plasma membrane is the ability to transmit signals by means of complex,\nintegral proteins known as receptors. These proteins act both as receivers of extracellular inputs and as activators of\nintracellular processes. These membrane receptors provide extracellular attachment sites for effectors like hormones and\ngrowth factors, and they activate intracellular response cascades when their effectors are bound. Occasionally, receptors\nare hijacked by viruses that use them to gain entry into cells, and at times, the genes encoding receptors become mutated,\ncausing the process of signal transduction to malfunction with disastrous consequences.\nFluid Mosaic Model\nThe existence of the plasma membrane was identified in the 1890s, and its chemical components were identified in\n1915. The principal components identified at that time were lipids and proteins. The first widely accepted model of the\nplasma membrane\u2019s structure was proposed in 1935 by Hugh Davson and James Danielli; it was based on the \u201crailroad\ntrack\u201d appearance of the plasma membrane in early electron micrographs. They theorized that the structure of the plasma\nmembrane resembles a sandwich, with protein being analogous to the bread, and lipids being analogous to the filling. In\nthe 1950s, advances in microscopy, notably transmission electron microscopy (TEM), allowed researchers to see that the\ncore of the plasma membrane consisted of a double, rather than a single, layer. A new model that better explains both the\nmicroscopic observations and the function of that plasma membrane was proposed by S.J. Singer and Garth L. Nicolson in\n1972.\nThe explanation proposed by Singer and Nicolson is called the fluid mosaic model. The model has evolved somewhat over\ntime, but it still best accounts for the structure and functions of the plasma membrane as we now understand them. The\nfluid mosaic model describes the structure of the plasma membrane as a mosaic of components\u2014including phospholipids,\ncholesterol, proteins, and carbohydrates\u2014that gives the membrane a fluid character. Plasma membranes range from 5 to\n10 nm in thickness. For comparison, human red blood cells, visible via light microscopy, are approximately 8 \u00b5m wide, or\napproximately 1,000 times wider than a plasma membrane. The membrane does look a bit like a sandwich (Figure 5.2).\nFigure 5.2 The fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane describes the plasma membrane as a fluid combination of\nphospholipids, cholesterol, and proteins. Carbohydrates attached to lipids (glycolipids) and to proteins (glycoproteins)\nextend from the outward-facing surface of the membrane.\nThe principal components of a plasma membrane are lipids (phospholipids and cholesterol), proteins, and carbohydrates\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\n197\nattached to some of the lipids and some of the proteins. A phospholipid is a molecule consisting of glycerol, two fatty acids,\nand a phosphate-linked head group. Cholesterol, another lipid composed of four fused carbon rings, is found alongside the\nphospholipids in the core of the membrane. The proportions of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates in the plasma membrane\nvary with cell type, but for a typical human cell, protein accounts for about 50 percent of the composition by mass, lipids\n(of all types) account for about 40 percent of the composition by mass, with the remaining 10 percent of the composition\nby mass being carbohydrates. However, the concentration of proteins and lipids varies with different cell membranes. For\nexample, myelin, an outgrowth of the membrane of specialized cells that insulates the axons of the peripheral nerves,\ncontains only 18 percent protein and 76 percent lipid. The mitochondrial inner membrane contains 76 percent protein and\nonly 24 percent lipid. The plasma membrane of human red blood cells is 30 percent lipid. Carbohydrates are present only\non the exterior surface of the plasma membrane and are attached to proteins, forming glycoproteins, or attached to lipids,\nforming glycolipids.\nPhospholipids\nThe main fabric of the membrane is composed of amphiphilic, phospholipid molecules. The hydrophilic or \u201cwater-loving\u201d\nareas of these molecules (which look like a collection of balls in an artist\u2019s rendition of the model) (Figure 5.2) are in contact\nwith the aqueous fluid both inside and outside the cell. Hydrophobic, or water-hating molecules, tend to be non-polar.\nThey interact with other non-polar molecules in chemical reactions, but generally do not interact with polar molecules.\nWhen placed in water, hydrophobic molecules tend to form a ball or cluster. The hydrophilic regions of the phospholipids\ntend to form hydrogen bonds with water and other polar molecules on both the exterior and interior of the cell. Thus, the\nmembrane surfaces that face the interior and exterior of the cell are hydrophilic. In contrast, the interior of the cell membrane\nis hydrophobic and will not interact with water. Therefore, phospholipids form an excellent two-layer cell membrane that\nseparates fluid within the cell from the fluid outside of the cell.\nA phospholipid molecule (Figure 5.3) consists of a three-carbon glycerol backbone with two fatty acid molecules attached\nto carbons 1 and 2, and a phosphate-containing group attached to the third carbon. This arrangement gives the overall\nmolecule an area described as its head (the phosphate-containing group), which has a polar character or negative charge,\nand an area called the tail (the fatty acids), which has no charge. The head can form hydrogen bonds, but the tail cannot. A\nmolecule with this arrangement of a positively or negatively charged area and an uncharged, or non-polar, area is referred\nto as amphiphilic or \u201cdual-loving.\u201d\nFigure 5.3 This phospholipid molecule is composed of a hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic tails. The hydrophilic\nhead group consists of a phosphate-containing group attached to a glycerol molecule. The hydrophobic tails, each\ncontaining either a saturated or an unsaturated fatty acid, are long hydrocarbon chains.\nThis characteristic is vital to the structure of a plasma membrane because, in water, phospholipids tend to become arranged\nwith their hydrophobic tails facing each other and their hydrophilic heads facing out. In this way, they form a lipid\n198\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nbilayer\u2014a barrier composed of a double layer of phospholipids that separates the water and other materials on one side of\nthe barrier from the water and other materials on the other side. In fact, phospholipids heated in an aqueous solution tend\nto spontaneously form small spheres or droplets (called micelles or liposomes), with their hydrophilic heads forming the\nexterior and their hydrophobic tails on the inside (Figure 5.4).\nFigure 5.4 In an aqueous solution, phospholipids tend to arrange themselves with their polar heads facing outward\nand their hydrophobic tails facing inward. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nProteins\nProteins make up the second major component of plasma membranes. Integral proteins (some specialized types are called\nintegrins) are, as their name suggests, integrated completely into the membrane structure, and their hydrophobic membrane-\nspanning regions interact with the hydrophobic region of the the phospholipid bilayer (Figure 5.2). Single-pass integral\nmembrane proteins usually have a hydrophobic transmembrane segment that consists of 20\u201325 amino acids. Some span\nonly part of the membrane\u2014associating with a single layer\u2014while others stretch from one side of the membrane to the\nother, and are exposed on either side. Some complex proteins are composed of up to 12 segments of a single protein, which\nare extensively folded and embedded in the membrane (Figure 5.5). This type of protein has a hydrophilic region or regions,\nand one or several mildly hydrophobic regions. This arrangement of regions of the protein tends to orient the protein\nalongside the phospholipids, with the hydrophobic region of the protein adjacent to the tails of the phospholipids and the\nhydrophilic region or regions of the protein protruding from the membrane and in contact with the cytosol or extracellular\nfluid.\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\n199\nFigure 5.5 Integral membranes proteins may have one or more alpha-helices that span the membrane (examples 1\nand 2), or they may have beta-sheets that span the membrane (example 3). (credit: \u201cFoobar\u201d/Wikimedia Commons)\nPeripheral proteins are found on the exterior and interior surfaces of membranes, attached either to integral proteins or\nto phospholipids. Peripheral proteins, along with integral proteins, may serve as enzymes, as structural attachments for\nthe fibers of the cytoskeleton, or as part of the cell\u2019s recognition sites. These are sometimes referred to as \u201ccell-specific\u201d\nproteins. The body recognizes its own proteins and attacks foreign proteins associated with invasive pathogens.\nCarbohydrates\nCarbohydrates are the third major component of plasma membranes. They are always found on the exterior surface of cells\nand are bound either to proteins (forming glycoproteins) or to lipids (forming glycolipids) (Figure 5.2). These carbohydrate\nchains may consist of 2\u201360 monosaccharide units and can be either straight or branched. Along with peripheral proteins,\ncarbohydrates form specialized sites on the cell surface that allow cells to recognize each other. These sites have unique\npatterns that allow the cell to be recognized, much the way that the facial features unique to each person allow him or her to\nbe recognized. This recognition function is very important to cells, as it allows the immune system to differentiate between\nbody cells (called \u201cself\u201d) and foreign cells or tissues (called \u201cnon-self\u201d). Similar types of glycoproteins and glycolipids are\nfound on the surfaces of viruses and may change frequently, preventing immune cells from recognizing and attacking them.\nThese carbohydrates on the exterior surface of the cell\u2014the carbohydrate components of both glycoproteins and\nglycolipids\u2014are collectively referred to as the glycocalyx (meaning \u201csugar coating\u201d). The glycocalyx is highly hydrophilic\nand attracts large amounts of water to the surface of the cell. This aids in the interaction of the cell with its watery\nenvironment and in the cell\u2019s ability to obtain substances dissolved in the water. As discussed above, the glycocalyx is\nalso important for cell identification, self/non-self determination, and embryonic development, and is used in cell-cell\nattachments to form tissues.\n200\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nHow Viruses Infect Specific Organs\nGlycoprotein and glycolipid patterns on the surfaces of cells give many viruses an opportunity for infection.\nHIV and hepatitis viruses infect only specific organs or cells in the human body. HIV is able to penetrate\nthe plasma membranes of a subtype of lymphocytes called T-helper cells, as well as some monocytes and\ncentral nervous system cells. The hepatitis virus attacks liver cells.\nThese viruses are able to invade these cells, because the cells have binding sites on their surfaces that are\nspecific to and compatible with certain viruses (Figure 5.6). Other recognition sites on the virus\u2019s surface\ninteract with the human immune system, prompting the body to produce antibodies. Antibodies are made\nin response to the antigens or proteins associated with invasive pathogens, or in response to foreign cells,\nsuch as might occur with an organ transplant. These same sites serve as places for antibodies to attach and\neither destroy or inhibit the activity of the virus. Unfortunately, these recognition sites on HIV change at a\nrapid rate because of mutations, making the production of an effective vaccine against the virus very difficult,\nas the virus evolves and adapts. A person infected with HIV will quickly develop different populations, or\nvariants, of the virus that are distinguished by differences in these recognition sites. This rapid change of\nsurface markers decreases the effectiveness of the person\u2019s immune system in attacking the virus, because\nthe antibodies will not recognize the new variations of the surface patterns. In the case of HIV, the problem\nis compounded by the fact that the virus specifically infects and destroys cells involved in the immune\nresponse, further incapacitating the host.\nFigure 5.6 HIV binds to the CD4 receptor, a glycoprotein on the surfaces of T cells. (credit: modification of work\nby NIH, NIAID)\nWhy does the immune system attack a transplanted organ?\na.\nGlycoproteins and glycolipids on the surface of the organ are similar to those found on pathogens.\nb.\nGlycoproteins and glycolipids on the surface of the organ are not recognized by the immune system.\nc.\nGlycoproteins and glycolipids on the surface of the organ are toxic to the body.\nd.\nGlycoproteins and glycolipids on the surface of the organ are similar to those found on immune cells.\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\n201\nMembrane Fluidity\nThe mosaic characteristic of the membrane, described in the fluid mosaic model, helps to illustrate its nature. The\nintegral proteins and lipids exist in the membrane as separate but loosely attached molecules. These resemble the separate,\nmulticolored tiles of a mosaic picture, and they float, moving somewhat with respect to one another. The membrane is not\nlike a balloon, however, that can expand and contract; rather, it is fairly rigid and can burst if penetrated or if a cell takes in\ntoo much water. However, because of its mosaic nature, a very fine needle can easily penetrate a plasma membrane without\ncausing it to burst, and the membrane will flow and self-seal when the needle is extracted.\nThe mosaic characteristics of the membrane explain some but not all of its fluidity. There are two other factors that help\nmaintain this fluid characteristic. One factor is the nature of the phospholipids themselves. In their saturated form, the fatty\nacids in phospholipid tails are saturated with bound hydrogen atoms. There are no double bonds between adjacent carbon\natoms. This results in tails that are relatively straight. In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids do not contain a maximal number\nof hydrogen atoms, but they do contain some double bonds between adjacent carbon atoms; a double bond results in a bend\nin the string of carbons of approximately 30 degrees (Figure 5.3).\nThus, if saturated fatty acids, with their straight tails, are compressed by decreasing temperatures, they press in on each\nother, making a dense and fairly rigid membrane. If unsaturated fatty acids are compressed, the \u201ckinks\u201d in their tails\nelbow adjacent phospholipid molecules away, maintaining some space between the phospholipid molecules. This \u201celbow\nroom\u201d helps to maintain fluidity in the membrane at temperatures at which membranes with saturated fatty acid tails in\ntheir phospholipids would \u201cfreeze\u201d or solidify. The relative fluidity of the membrane is particularly important in a cold\nenvironment. A cold environment tends to compress membranes composed largely of saturated fatty acids, making them\nless fluid and more susceptible to rupturing. Many organisms (fish are one example) are capable of adapting to cold\nenvironments by changing the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in their membranes in response to the lowering of the\ntemperature.\nVisit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/biological_memb) to see animations of the fluidity and mosaic quality of\nmembranes.\nExplain why glucose cannot pass directly through the cell membrane.\na.\nThe plasma membrane is impermeable to polar molecules, so transport proteins are required.\nb.\nThe plasma membrane is selectively permeable to polar molecules, and a transport protein is required for\nlarger molecules.\nc.\nThe plasma membrane is permeable to all polar molecules, but a transport protein is required.\nd.\nThe plasma membrane is selectively permeable to all polar molecules and a transport protein is never\nrequired for them.\nAnimals have an additional membrane constituent that assists in maintaining fluidity. Cholesterol, which lies alongside the\nphospholipids in the membrane, tends to dampen the effects of temperature on the membrane. Thus, this lipid functions\nas a buffer, preventing lower temperatures from inhibiting fluidity and preventing increased temperatures from increasing\nfluidity too much. Thus, cholesterol extends, in both directions, the range of temperature in which the membrane is\nappropriately fluid and consequently functional. Cholesterol also serves other functions, such as organizing clusters of\ntransmembrane proteins into lipid rafts.\n202\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nThe Components and Functions of the Plasma Membrane\nComponent\nLocation\nPhospholipid\nMain fabric of the membrane\nCholesterol\nAttached between phospholipids and between the two\nphospholipid layers\nIntegral proteins (for example, integrins)\nEmbedded within the phospholipid layer(s).

These changes are taken into consideration in vaccine development. Many\ninfectious diseases, such as smallpox, polio, diphtheria, and tetanus, were conquered by the use of\nvaccines.\nImmunologists are the physicians and scientists who research and develop vaccines, as well as treat and\nstudy allergies or other immune problems. Some immunologists study and treat autoimmune problems\n(diseases in which a person\u2019s immune system attacks his or her own cells or tissues, such as lupus) and\nimmunodeficiencies, whether acquired (by a virus, for example) or hereditary (such as severe combined\nimmunodeficiency, or SCID). Immunologists are called in to help treat organ transplantation patients, who\nmust have their immune systems suppressed so that their bodies will not reject a transplanted organ. Some\nimmunologists work to understand natural immunity and the effects of a person\u2019s environment on it. Others\nwork on questions about how the immune system affects the development of certain chronic diseases.\nTo work as an immunologist, a PhD or MD is required. In addition, immunologists undertake at least 2\u20133\nyears of training in an accredited program and must pass an examination given by the American Board of\nAllergy and Immunology. Immunologists must possess knowledge of the functions of the human body as\nthey relate to issues beyond immunization, and knowledge of pharmacology and medical technology, such\nas medications, therapies, test materials, and surgical procedures.\nActivity\nUsing appropriate media, construct a model of the plasma membrane and its molecular components.

        "summary": "The plasma membrane, described by the fluid mosaic model, is a dynamic, selectively permeable barrier composed mainly of phospholipids, proteins, cholesterol, and carbohydrates. Phospholipids form a bilayer with hydrophilic heads facing aqueous environments and hydrophobic tails inward, creating a stable yet flexible structure. Integral proteins span or embed within the membrane to facilitate transport, act as receptors, or provide structural support, while peripheral proteins attach to surfaces for enzymatic activity, recognition, or cytoskeletal anchoring. Carbohydrates, bound to proteins (glycoproteins) or lipids (glycolipids), form the glycocalyx, aiding in cell recognition, adhesion, and immune responses. Membrane fluidity is maintained by the nature of phospholipid tails (saturated or unsaturated) and regulated by cholesterol, which buffers temperature effects and organizes protein clusters. The specific arrangement of these components enables the membrane\u2019s roles in signaling, intercellular interaction, protection, and environmental adaptation."

If they were to lose this selectivity, the cell would no longer be able\nto sustain itself, and it would be destroyed. Some cells require larger amounts of specific substances than do other cells;\nthey must have a way of obtaining these materials from extracellular fluids. This may happen passively, as certain materials\nmove back and forth, or the cell may have special mechanisms that facilitate transport. Some materials are so important to a\ncell that it spends some of its energy, hydrolyzing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to obtain these materials. Red blood cells\nuse some of their energy doing just that. Most cells spend the majority of their energy to maintain an imbalance of sodium\nand potassium ions between the interior and exterior of the cell.\nThe most direct forms of membrane transport are passive. Passive transport is a naturally occurring phenomenon and does\nnot require the cell to exert any of its energy to accomplish the movement. In passive transport, substances move from an\narea of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. A physical space in which there is a range of concentrations\nof a single substance is said to have a concentration gradient.\nSelective Permeability\nPlasma membranes are asymmetric: the interior of the membrane is not identical to the exterior of the membrane. In fact,\nthere is a considerable difference between the array of phospholipids and proteins between the two leaflets that form a\nmembrane. On the interior of the membrane, some proteins serve to anchor the membrane to fibers of the cytoskeleton.\nThere are peripheral proteins on the exterior of the membrane that bind elements of the extracellular matrix. Carbohydrates,\nattached to lipids or proteins, are also found on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane. These carbohydrate complexes\nhelp the cell bind substances that the cell needs in the extracellular fluid. This adds considerably to the selective nature of\nplasma membranes (Figure 5.7).\nFigure 5.7 The exterior surface of the plasma membrane is not identical to the interior surface of the same membrane.\nRecall that plasma membranes are amphiphilic: They have hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. This characteristic helps\nthe movement of some materials through the membrane and hinders the movement of others. Lipid-soluble material with a\nlow molecular weight can easily slip through the hydrophobic lipid core of the membrane. Substances such as the fat-soluble\nvitamins A, D, E, and K readily pass through the plasma membranes in the digestive tract and other tissues. Fat-soluble\ndrugs and hormones also gain easy entry into cells and are readily transported into the body\u2019s tissues and organs. Similarly,\nmolecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide have no charge and so pass through membranes by simple diffusion.\nPolar substances present problems for the membrane. While some polar molecules connect easily with the outside of a\ncell, they cannot readily pass through the lipid core of the plasma membrane. Additionally, while small ions could easily\nslip through the spaces in the mosaic of the membrane, their charge prevents them from doing so. Ions such as sodium,\npotassium, calcium, and chloride must have special means of penetrating plasma membranes. Simple sugars and amino\nacids also need help with transport across plasma membranes, achieved by various transmembrane proteins (channels).\nDiffusion\nDiffusion is a passive process of transport. A single substance tends to move from an area of high concentration to an area\nof low concentration until the concentration is equal across a space. You are familiar with diffusion of substances through\nthe air. For example, think about someone opening a bottle of ammonia in a room filled with people. The ammonia gas is at\nits highest concentration in the bottle; its lowest concentration is at the edges of the room. The ammonia vapor will diffuse,\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\n205\nor spread away, from the bottle, and gradually, more and more people will smell the ammonia as it spreads. Materials move\nwithin the cell\u2019s cytosol by diffusion, and certain materials move through the plasma membrane by diffusion (Figure 5.8).\nDiffusion expends no energy. On the contrary, concentration gradients are a form of potential energy, dissipated as the\ngradient is eliminated.\nFigure 5.8 Diffusion through a permeable membrane moves a substance from an area of high concentration\n(extracellular fluid, in this case) down its concentration gradient (into the cytoplasm). (credit: modification of work by\nMariana Ruiz Villareal)\nEach separate substance in a medium, such as the extracellular fluid, has its own concentration gradient, independent of\nthe concentration gradients of other materials. In addition, each substance will diffuse according to that gradient. Within a\nsystem, there will be different rates of diffusion of the different substances in the medium.\nFactors That Affect Diffusion\nMolecules move constantly in a random manner, at a rate that depends on their mass, their environment, and the amount\nof thermal energy they possess, which in turn is a function of temperature. This movement accounts for the diffusion of\nmolecules through whatever medium in which they are localized. A substance will tend to move into any space available\nto it until it is evenly distributed throughout it. After a substance has diffused completely through a space, removing its\nconcentration gradient, molecules will still move around in the space, but there will be no net movement of the number of\nmolecules from one area to another. This lack of a concentration gradient in which there is no net movement of a substance\nis known as dynamic equilibrium. While diffusion will go forward in the presence of a concentration gradient of a substance,\nseveral factors affect the rate of diffusion.\n\u2022\nExtent of the concentration gradient: The greater the difference in concentration, the more rapid the diffusion. The\ncloser the distribution of the material gets to equilibrium, the slower the rate of diffusion becomes.\n\u2022\nMass of the molecules diffusing: Heavier molecules move more slowly; therefore, they diffuse more slowly. The\nreverse is true for lighter molecules.\n\u2022\nTemperature: Higher temperatures increase the energy and therefore the movement of the molecules, increasing the\nrate of diffusion. Lower temperatures decrease the energy of the molecules, thus decreasing the rate of diffusion.\n\u2022\nSolvent density: As the density of a solvent increases, the rate of diffusion decreases. The molecules slow down\nbecause they have a more difficult time getting through the denser medium. If the medium is less dense, diffusion\nincreases. Because cells primarily use diffusion to move materials within the cytoplasm, any increase in the\ncytoplasm\u2019s density will inhibit the movement of the materials. An example of this is a person experiencing\ndehydration. As the body\u2019s cells lose water, the rate of diffusion decreases in the cytoplasm, and the cells\u2019 functions\ndeteriorate. Neurons tend to be very sensitive to this effect. Dehydration frequently leads to unconsciousness and\npossibly coma because of the decrease in diffusion rate within the cells.\n\u2022\nSolubility: As discussed earlier, nonpolar or lipid-soluble materials pass through plasma membranes more easily than\npolar materials, allowing a faster rate of diffusion.\n\u2022\nSurface area and thickness of the plasma membrane: Increased surface area increases the rate of diffusion, whereas a\nthicker membrane reduces it.\n\u2022\nDistance travelled: The greater the distance that a substance must travel, the slower the rate of diffusion. This places\nan upper limitation on cell size. A large, spherical cell will die because nutrients or waste cannot reach or leave the\n206\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\ncenter of the cell, respectively. Therefore, cells must either be small in size, as in the case of many prokaryotes, or be\nflattened, as with many single-celled eukaryotes.\nA variation of diffusion is the process of filtration. In filtration, material moves according to its concentration gradient\nthrough a membrane; sometimes the rate of diffusion is enhanced by pressure, causing the substances to filter more rapidly.\nThis occurs in the kidney, where blood pressure forces large amounts of water and accompanying dissolved substances, or\nsolutes, out of the blood and into the renal tubules. The rate of diffusion in this instance is almost totally dependent on\npressure. One of the effects of high blood pressure is the appearance of protein in the urine, which is \u201csqueezed through\u201d by\nthe abnormally high pressure.\nFacilitated transport\nIn facilitated transport, also called facilitated diffusion, materials diffuse across the plasma membrane with the help\nof membrane proteins. A concentration gradient exists that would allow these materials to diffuse into the cell without\nexpending cellular energy. However, these materials are polar molecules that are repelled by the hydrophobic parts of the\ncell membrane. Facilitated transport proteins shield these materials from the repulsive force of the membrane, allowing\nthem to diffuse into the cell.\nThe material being transported is first attached to protein or glycoprotein receptors on the exterior surface of the plasma\nmembrane. This allows the material that is needed by the cell to be removed from the extracellular fluid. The substances are\nthen passed to specific integral proteins that facilitate their passage. Some of these integral proteins are collections of beta\npleated sheets that form a pore or channel through the phospholipid bilayer. Others are carrier proteins which bind with the\nsubstance and aid its diffusion through the membrane.\nChannels\nThe integral proteins involved in facilitated transport are collectively referred to as transport proteins, and they function\nas either channels for the material or carriers. In both cases, they are transmembrane proteins. Channels are specific\nfor the substance that is being transported. Channel proteins have hydrophilic domains exposed to the intracellular and\nextracellular fluids; they additionally have a hydrophilic channel through their core that provides a hydrated opening\nthrough the membrane layers (Figure 5.9). Passage through the channel allows polar compounds to avoid the nonpolar\ncentral layer of the plasma membrane that would otherwise slow or prevent their entry into the cell. Aquaporins are channel\nproteins that allow water to pass through the membrane at a very high rate.\nFigure 5.9 Facilitated transport moves substances down their concentration gradients. They may cross the plasma\nmembrane with the aid of channel proteins. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nChannel proteins are either open at all times or they are \u201cgated,\u201d which controls the opening of the channel. The attachment\nof a particular ion to the channel protein may control the opening, or other mechanisms or substances may be involved.\nIn some tissues, sodium and chloride ions pass freely through open channels, whereas in other tissues a gate must be\nopened to allow passage. An example of this occurs in the kidney, where both forms of channels are found in different\nparts of the renal tubules. Cells involved in the transmission of electrical impulses, such as nerve and muscle cells, have\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\n207\ngated channels for sodium, potassium, and calcium in their membranes. Opening and closing of these channels changes\nthe relative concentrations on opposing sides of the membrane of these ions, resulting in the facilitation of electrical\ntransmission along membranes (in the case of nerve cells) or in muscle contraction (in the case of muscle cells).\nCarrier Proteins\nAnother type of protein embedded in the plasma membrane is a carrier protein. This aptly named protein binds a substance\nand, in doing so, triggers a change of its own shape, moving the bound molecule from the outside of the cell to its interior\n(Figure 5.10); depending on the gradient, the material may move in the opposite direction. Carrier proteins are typically\nspecific for a single substance. This selectivity adds to the overall selectivity of the plasma membrane. The exact mechanism\nfor the change of shape is poorly understood. Proteins can change shape when their hydrogen bonds are affected, but this\nmay not fully explain this mechanism. Each carrier protein is specific to one substance, and there are a finite number of\nthese proteins in any membrane. This can cause problems in transporting enough of the material for the cell to function\nproperly. When all of the proteins are bound to their ligands, they are saturated and the rate of transport is at its maximum.\nIncreasing the concentration gradient at this point will not result in an increased rate of transport.\nFigure 5.10 Some substances are able to move down their concentration gradient across the plasma membrane with\nthe aid of carrier proteins. Carrier proteins change shape as they move molecules across the membrane. (credit:\nmodification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nAn example of this process occurs in the kidney. Glucose, water, salts, ions, and amino acids needed by the body are filtered\nin one part of the kidney. This filtrate, which includes glucose, is then reabsorbed in another part of the kidney. Because\nthere are only a finite number of carrier proteins for glucose, if more glucose is present than the proteins can handle, the\nexcess is not transported and it is excreted from the body in the urine. In a diabetic individual, this is described as \u201cspilling\nglucose into the urine.\u201d A different group of carrier proteins called glucose transport proteins, or GLUTs, are involved in\ntransporting glucose and other hexose sugars through plasma membranes within the body.\nChannel and carrier proteins transport material at different rates. Channel proteins transport much more quickly than do\ncarrier proteins. Channel proteins facilitate diffusion at a rate of tens of millions of molecules per second, whereas carrier\nproteins work at a rate of a thousand to a million molecules per second.\nOsmosis\nOsmosis is the movement of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the concentration gradient of water\nacross the membrane, which is inversely proportional to the concentration of solutes. While diffusion transports material\nacross membranes and within cells, osmosis transports only water across a membrane and the membrane limits the diffusion\nof solutes in the water. Not surprisingly, the aquaporins that facilitate water movement play a large role in osmosis, most\nprominently in red blood cells and the membranes of kidney tubules.\nMechanism\nOsmosis is a special case of diffusion. Water, like other substances, moves from an area of high concentration to one of low\nconcentration. An obvious question is what makes water move at all? Imagine a beaker with a semipermeable membrane\nseparating the two sides or halves (Figure 5.11). On both sides of the membrane the water level is the same, but there are\ndifferent concentrations of a dissolved substance, or solute, that cannot cross the membrane (otherwise the concentrations\non each side would be balanced by the solute crossing the membrane). If the volume of the solution on both sides of the\n208\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nmembrane is the same, but the concentrations of solute are different, then there are different amounts of water, the solvent,\non either side of the membrane.\nFigure 5.11 In osmosis, water always moves from an area of higher water concentration to one of lower concentration.\nIn the diagram shown, the solute cannot pass through the selectively permeable membrane, but the water can.\nTo illustrate this, imagine two full glasses of water. One has a single teaspoon of sugar in it, whereas the second one contains\none-quarter cup of sugar. If the total volume of the solutions in both cups is the same, which cup contains more water?\nBecause the large amount of sugar in the second cup takes up much more space than the teaspoon of sugar in the first cup,\nthe first cup has more water in it.\nReturning to the beaker example, recall that it has a mixture of solutes on either side of the membrane. A principle of\ndiffusion is that the molecules move around and will spread evenly throughout the medium if they can. However, only the\nmaterial capable of getting through the membrane will diffuse through it. In this example, the solute cannot diffuse through\nthe membrane, but the water can. Water has a concentration gradient in this system. Thus, water will diffuse down its\nconcentration gradient, crossing the membrane to the side where it is less concentrated. This diffusion of water through the\nmembrane\u2014osmosis\u2014will continue until the concentration gradient of water goes to zero or until the hydrostatic pressure\nof the water balances the osmotic pressure. Osmosis proceeds constantly in living systems.\nThe beaker example here occurs in an open system where the volume of fluid can increase and decrease freely. Cells, on\nthe other hand, are composed of proteins and other substances embedded in the aqueous cytoplasm. These substances could\nbe considered solutes for the purposes of predicting osmosis. The cell membrane keeps most of the proteins and other\nsubstances within the cell, causing the cell to have a higher osmolarity than pure water.\nSuppose you perform an experiment where you placed red blood cells in an environment of pure water. What do you\nsuppose would happen to the cells? Because the concentration of solute is higher in the red blood cell than it is in the beaker,\nwater would rush into the red blood cell. What do you think would happen to the red blood cell, given that its cell membrane\nis made up of a fixed surface area? It is likely that the red blood cell will undergo hemolysis, where they swell up with water\nand burst. It should be noted, however, that most cells have mechanisms to prevent them from taking on too much water.\nHowever, red blood cells lack these controls, making them ideal for osmolarity studies.\nThis is an important consideration for clinicians delivering drugs intravenously. How would the drug have to be formulated,\nin terms of osmolarity, to prevent red blood cells from undergoing hemolysis? In order to prevent hemolysis of red blood\ncells in the blood, drugs are typically formulated in an isotonic solution with the blood to maintain osmolarity.\nTonicity\nTonicity describes how an extracellular solution can change the volume of a cell by affecting osmosis. A solution's tonicity\noften directly correlates with the osmolarity of the solution. Osmolarity describes the total solute concentration of the\nsolution. A solution with low osmolarity has a greater number of water molecules relative to the number of solute particles;\na solution with high osmolarity has fewer water molecules with respect to solute particles. In a situation in which solutions\nof two different osmolarities are separated by a membrane permeable to water, though not to the solute, water will move\nfrom the side of the membrane with lower osmolarity (and more water) to the side with higher osmolarity (and less water).\nThis effect makes sense if you remember that the solute cannot move across the membrane, and thus the only component in\nthe system that can move\u2014the water\u2014moves along its own concentration gradient. An important distinction that concerns\nliving systems is that osmolarity measures the number of particles (which may be molecules) in a solution. Therefore, a\nsolution that is cloudy with cells may have a lower osmolarity than a solution that is clear, if the second solution contains\nmore dissolved molecules than there are cells.\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\n209\nHypotonic Solutions\nThree terms\u2014hypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonic\u2014are used to relate the osmolarity of a cell to the osmolarity of the\nextracellular fluid that contains the cells. In a hypotonic situation, the extracellular fluid has lower osmolarity than the\nfluid inside the cell, and water enters the cell. (In living systems, the point of reference is always the cytoplasm, so the\nprefix hypo- means that the extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of solutes, or a lower osmolarity, than the cell\ncytoplasm.) It also means that the extracellular fluid has a higher concentration of water in the solution than does the cell.\nIn this situation, water will follow its concentration gradient and enter the cell.\nHypertonic Solutions\nAs for a hypertonic solution, the prefix hyper- refers to the extracellular fluid having a higher osmolarity than the cell\u2019s\ncytoplasm; therefore, the fluid contains less water than the cell does. Because the cell has a relatively higher concentration\nof water, water will leave the cell.\nIsotonic Solutions\nIn an isotonic solution, the extracellular fluid has the same osmolarity as the cell. If the osmolarity of the cell matches that\nof the extracellular fluid, there will be no net movement of water into or out of the cell, although water will still move in and\nout. Blood cells and plant cells in hypertonic, isotonic, and hypotonic solutions take on characteristic appearances (Figure\n5.12).\nFigure 5.12 Osmotic pressure changes the shape of red blood cells in hypertonic, isotonic, and hypotonic solutions\n(credit: Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nFor a video illustrating the process of diffusion in solutions, visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/dispersion) .\nExplain the difference between the two beakers (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/dispersion) .\na.\nThe lower temperature of left beaker causes yellow dye to diffuse faster than the right beaker.\nb.\nThe lower temperature in left beaker causes yellow dye to diffuse slower in it than in the right beaker.\nc.\nThe higher temperature of left beaker causes faster diffusion of yellow dye in the left beaker.\nd.\nThe higher temperature of right beaker causes slower diffusion of yellow dye in the right beaker.\nTonicity in Living Systems\nIn a hypotonic environment, water enters a cell, and the cell swells. In an isotonic condition, the relative concentrations of\nsolute and solvent are equal on both sides of the membrane. There is no net water movement; therefore, there is no change\nin the size of the cell. In a hypertonic solution, water leaves a cell and the cell shrinks. If either the hypo- or hyper- condition\ngoes to excess, the cell\u2019s functions become compromised, and the cell may be destroyed.\n210\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nA red blood cell will burst, or lyse, when it swells beyond the plasma membrane\u2019s capability to expand. Remember, the\nmembrane resembles a mosaic, with discrete spaces between the molecules composing it. If the cell swells, and the spaces\nbetween the lipids and proteins become too large, the cell will break apart.\nIn contrast, when excessive amounts of water leave a red blood cell, the cell shrinks, or crenates. This has the effect of\nconcentrating the solutes left in the cell, making the cytosol denser and interfering with diffusion within the cell. The cell\u2019s\nability to function will be compromised and may also result in the death of the cell.\nVarious living things have ways of controlling the effects of osmosis\u2014a mechanism called osmoregulation. Some\norganisms, such as plants, fungi, bacteria, and some protists, have cell walls that surround the plasma membrane and prevent\ncell lysis in a hypotonic solution. The plasma membrane can only expand to the limit of the cell wall, so the cell will not\nlyse. In fact, the cytoplasm in plants is always slightly hypertonic to the cellular environment, and water will always enter\na cell if water is available. This inflow of water produces turgor pressure, which stiffens the cell walls of the plant (Figure\n5.13). In nonwoody plants, turgor pressure supports the plant. Conversly, if the plant is not watered, the extracellular fluid\nwill become hypertonic, causing water to leave the cell. In this condition, the cell does not shrink because the cell wall is\nnot flexible. However, the cell membrane detaches from the wall and constricts the cytoplasm. This is called plasmolysis.\nPlants lose turgor pressure in this condition and wilt (Figure 5.14).\nFigure 5.13 The turgor pressure within a plant cell depends on the tonicity of the solution that it is bathed in. (credit:\nmodification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nFigure 5.14 Without adequate water, the plant on the left has lost turgor pressure, visible in its wilting; the turgor\npressure is restored by watering it (right). (credit: Victor M. Vicente Selvas)\nTonicity is a concern for all living things. For example, paramecia and amoebas, which are protists that lack cell walls, have\ncontractile vacuoles. This vesicle collects excess water from the cell and pumps it out, keeping the cell from lysing as it\ntakes on water from its environment (Figure 5.15).\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\n211\nFigure 5.15 A paramecium\u2019s contractile vacuole, here visualized using bright field light microscopy at 480x\nmagnification, continuously pumps water out of the organism\u2019s body to keep it from bursting in a hypotonic medium.\n(credit: modification of work by NIH; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nMany marine invertebrates have internal salt levels matched to their environments, making them isotonic with the water\nin which they live.

        "summary": "Passive transport is the movement of substances across the plasma membrane without energy expenditure by the cell, driven by concentration gradients from areas of higher to lower concentration. The selectively permeable membrane allows certain molecules, such as small nonpolar substances, to diffuse directly, while polar molecules and ions require facilitated transport via channel or carrier proteins. Diffusion rates depend on factors like concentration gradient, molecule mass, temperature, solvent density, solubility, membrane surface area/thickness, and travel distance; filtration is a pressure-assisted variation. Osmosis, a special case of diffusion, involves water moving across a semipermeable membrane according to its concentration gradient, influencing cell volume depending on tonicity: hypotonic solutions cause water influx and swelling, hypertonic solutions cause water loss and shrinkage, and isotonic solutions maintain equilibrium. Organisms regulate osmotic effects through strategies like cell walls, contractile vacuoles, salt regulation, and kidney function to maintain homeostasis."

The sodium-potassium pump, which maintains electrochemical gradients across the membranes of\nnerve cells in animals, is an example of primary active transport.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 2.10][APLO 2.17][APLO 1.2][APLO 3.24]\nActive transport mechanisms require the use of the cell\u2019s energy, usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). If\na substance must move into the cell against its concentration gradient\u2014that is, if the concentration of the substance inside\nthe cell is greater than its concentration in the extracellular fluid (and vice versa)\u2014the cell must use energy to move the\nsubstance. Some active transport mechanisms move small-molecular weight materials, such as ions, through the membrane.\nOther mechanisms transport much larger molecules.\nElectrochemical Gradient\nWe have discussed simple concentration gradients\u2014differential concentrations of a substance across a space or a\nmembrane\u2014but in living systems, gradients are more complex. Because ions move into and out of cells and because\ncells contain proteins that do not move across the membrane and are mostly negatively charged, there is also an electrical\ngradient, a difference of charge, across the plasma membrane. The interior of living cells is electrically negative with respect\nto the extracellular fluid in which they are bathed, and at the same time, cells have higher concentrations of potassium (K+)\nand lower concentrations of sodium (Na+) than does the extracellular fluid. So in a living cell, the concentration gradient\nof Na+ tends to drive it into the cell, and the electrical gradient of Na+ (a positive ion) also tends to drive it inward to the\nnegatively charged interior. The situation is more complex, however, for other elements such as potassium. The electrical\ngradient of K+, a positive ion, also tends to drive it into the cell, but the concentration gradient of K+ tends to drive K+\nout of the cell (Figure 5.16). The combined gradient of concentration and electrical charge that affects an ion is called its\nelectrochemical gradient.\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\n213\nFigure 5.16 Electrochemical gradients arise from the combined effects of concentration gradients and electrical\ngradients. Structures labeled A represent proteins.

This energy is harvested\nfrom ATP generated through the cell\u2019s metabolism. Active transport mechanisms, collectively called pumps, work against\nelectrochemical gradients. Small substances constantly pass through plasma membranes. Active transport maintains\nconcentrations of ions and other substances needed by living cells in the face of these passive movements. Much of a cell\u2019s\nsupply of metabolic energy may be spent maintaining these processes. (Most of a red blood cell\u2019s metabolic energy is used\nto maintain the imbalance between exterior and interior sodium and potassium levels required by the cell.) Because active\ntransport mechanisms depend on a cell\u2019s metabolism for energy, they are sensitive to many metabolic poisons that interfere\nwith the supply of ATP.\nTwo mechanisms exist for the transport of small-molecular weight material and small molecules. Primary active transport\nmoves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane, which is directly dependent on ATP.\nSecondary active transport describes the movement of material that is due to the electrochemical gradient established by\nprimary active transport that does not directly require ATP.\n214\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nCarrier Proteins for Active Transport\nAn important membrane adaption for active transport is the presence of specific carrier proteins or pumps to facilitate\nmovement: there are three types of these proteins or transporters (Figure 5.17). A uniporter carries one specific ion or\nmolecule. A symporter carries two different ions or molecules, both in the same direction. An antiporter also carries two\ndifferent ions or molecules, but in different directions. All of these transporters can also transport small, uncharged organic\nmolecules like glucose. These three types of carrier proteins are also found in facilitated diffusion, but they do not require\nATP to work in that process. Some examples of pumps for active transport are Na+-K+ ATPase, which carries sodium and\npotassium ions, and H+-K+ ATPase, which carries hydrogen and potassium ions. Both of these are antiporter carrier proteins.\nTwo other carrier proteins are Ca2+ ATPase and H+ ATPase, which carry only calcium and only hydrogen ions, respectively.\nBoth are pumps.\nFigure 5.17 A uniporter carries one molecule or ion. A symporter carries two different molecules or ions, both in the\nsame direction. An antiporter also carries two different molecules or ions, but in different directions. (credit: modification\nof work by \u201cLupask\u201d/Wikimedia Commons)\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\n215\nThe primary active transport that functions with the active transport of sodium and potassium allows\nsecondary active transport to occur. The second transport method is still considered active because it\ndepends on the use of energy as does primary transport (illustrative example).\nFigure 5.18 Primary active transport moves ions across a membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient\n(electrogenic transport). (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nOne of the most important pumps in animal cells is the sodium-potassium pump (Na+-K+ ATPase), which\nmaintains the electrochemical gradient (and the correct concentrations of Na+ and K+) in living cells. The\nsodium-potassium pump moves K+ into the cell while moving Na+ out at the same time, at a ratio of three\nNa+ for every two K+ ions moved in. The Na+-K+ ATPase exists in two forms, depending on its orientation to\nthe interior or exterior of the cell and its affinity for either sodium or potassium ions. The process consists of\nthe following six steps:\n1.\nWith the enzyme oriented towards the interior of the cell, the carrier has a high affinity for sodium ions.\nThree ions bind to the protein.\n2.\nThe protein carrier hydrolyzes ATP and a low-energy phosphate group attaches to it.\n3.\nAs a result, the carrier changes shape and re-orients itself towards the exterior of the membrane. The\nprotein\u2019s affinity for sodium decreases and the three sodium ions leave the carrier.\n4.\nThe shape change increases the carrier\u2019s affinity for potassium ions, and two such ions attach to the\nprotein. Subsequently, the low-energy phosphate group detaches from the carrier.\n5.\nWith the phosphate group removed and potassium ions attached, the carrier protein repositions itself\ntowards the interior of the cell.\n6.\nThe carrier protein, in its new configuration, has a decreased affinity for potassium, and the two ions\nare released into the cytoplasm. The protein now has a higher affinity for sodium ions, and the process\nstarts again.\nSeveral things have happened as a result of this process. At this point, there are more sodium ions outside\nof the cell than inside and more potassium ions inside than out. For every three ions of sodium that move\nout, two ions of potassium move in. This results in the interior being slightly more negative relative to\nthe exterior. This difference in charge is important to creating the conditions necessary for the secondary\nprocess. Therefore, the sodium-potassium pump is an electrogenic pump (a pump that creates a charge\nimbalance) contributing to the membrane potential.\nWhat will happen to the opening of the sodium-potassium pump if no ATP is present in a cell?\na.\nIt will remain facing the extracellular space, with sodium ions bound.\nb.\nIt will remain facing the extracellular space, with potassium ions bound.\nc.\nIt will remain facing the cytoplasm, but no sodium ions would bind.\n216\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nd.\nIt will remain facing the cytoplasm, with sodium ions bound.\nVisit the site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/Na_K_ATPase) to see a simulation of active transport in a sodium-potassium\nATPase.\nSodium and potassium are necessary electrolytes.

Justify your reasoning.\nSecondary Active Transport (Co-transport)\nSecondary active transport brings sodium ions, and possibly other compounds, into the cell. As sodium ion concentrations\nbuild outside of the plasma membrane because of the action of the primary active transport process, an electrochemical\ngradient is created. If a channel protein exists and is open, the sodium ions will be pulled through the membrane. This\nmovement is used to transport other substances that can attach themselves to the transport protein through the membrane\n(Figure 5.19). Many amino acids, as well as glucose, enter a cell this way. This secondary process is also used to store\nhigh-energy hydrogen ions in the mitochondria of plant and animal cells for the production of ATP. The potential energy\nthat accumulates in the stored hydrogen ions is translated into kinetic energy as the ions surge through the channel protein\nATP synthase, and that energy is used to convert ADP into ATP.\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\n217\nFigure 5.19 An electrochemical gradient, created by primary active transport, can move other substances against\ntheir concentration gradients, a process called co-transport or secondary active transport.

For example, when bacteria invade the human\nbody, a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil will remove the invaders by this process. Similarly, in pinocytosis\nor \u201ccell drinking,\u201d the cell takes in droplets of liquid. In receptor-mediated endocytosis, uptake of substances by the\ncell is targeted to a single type of substance that binds to a specific receptor protein on the external surface of the cell\nmembrane (e.g., hormones and their target cells) before under going endocytosis. Some human diseases, such as familial\nhypercholesterolemia, are caused by the failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Electrochemical gradients combine differences in concentration and electrical charge across the membrane and influence ion movement. Primary active transport, such as the sodium-potassium pump (Na\u207a-K\u207a ATPase), directly uses ATP to move ions and establish charge imbalances critical for cellular function, while secondary active transport (co-transport) uses the energy stored in these gradients to move other substances like glucose or amino acids. Carrier proteins involved include uniporters (one substance, one direction), symporters (two substances, same direction), and antiporters (two substances, opposite directions). The sodium-potassium pump works through a six-step cycle to exchange three sodium ions out for two potassium ions in, creating a slightly negative interior and maintaining essential ionic balances. Secondary active transport leverages these gradients to drive the uptake of other molecules or store ions, such as hydrogen ions in mitochondria, for ATP production."

Similarly, in pinocytosis\nor \u201ccell drinking,\u201d the cell takes in droplets of liquid. In receptor-mediated endocytosis, uptake of substances by the\ncell is targeted to a single type of substance that binds to a specific receptor protein on the external surface of the cell\nmembrane (e.g., hormones and their target cells) before under going endocytosis. Some human diseases, such as familial\nhypercholesterolemia, are caused by the failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Exocytosis is the process of exporting\n218\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nmaterial out of the cell; vesicles containing substances fuse with the plasma membrane and the contents are released to the\nexterior of the cell.

Some cells are even capable of engulfing entire unicellular\nmicroorganisms. You might have correctly hypothesized that the uptake and release of large particles by the cell requires\nenergy. A large particle, however, cannot pass through the membrane, even with energy supplied by the cell.\nEndocytosis\nEndocytosis is a type of active transport that moves particles, such as large molecules, parts of cells, and even whole cells,\ninto a cell. There are different variations of endocytosis, but all share a common characteristic: The plasma membrane of the\ncell invaginates, forming a pocket around the target particle. The pocket pinches off, resulting in the particle being contained\nin a newly created intracellular vesicle formed from the plasma membrane.\nPhagocytosis\nPhagocytosis (the condition of \u201ccell eating\u201d) is the process by which large particles, such as cells or relatively large particles,\nare taken in by a cell. For example, when microorganisms invade the human body, a type of white blood cell called a\nneutrophil will remove the invaders through this process, surrounding and engulfing the microorganism, which is then\ndestroyed by the neutrophil (Figure 5.20).\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\n219\nFigure 5.20 In phagocytosis, the cell membrane surrounds the particle and engulfs it. (credit: Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nIn preparation for phagocytosis, a portion of the inward-facing surface of the plasma membrane becomes coated with a\nprotein called clathrin, which stabilizes this section of the membrane. The coated portion of the membrane then extends\nfrom the body of the cell and surrounds the particle, eventually enclosing it. Once the vesicle containing the particle\nis enclosed within the cell, the clathrin disengages from the membrane and the vesicle merges with a lysosome for the\nbreakdown of the material in the newly formed compartment (endosome). When accessible nutrients from the degradation\nof the vesicular contents have been extracted, the newly formed endosome merges with the plasma membrane and releases\nits contents into the extracellular fluid. The endosomal membrane again becomes part of the plasma membrane.\nActivity\nCreate a representation/diagram to describe how a neutrophil, a type of human white blood cell, attacks and\ndestroys an invading bacterium. What cellular organelles are involved in this process?\nPinocytosis\nA variation of endocytosis is called pinocytosis. This literally means \u201ccell drinking\u201d and was named at a time when the\nassumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid. In reality, this is a process that takes in molecules,\nincluding water, which the cell needs from the extracellular fluid. Pinocytosis results in a much smaller vesicle than does\nphagocytosis, and the vesicle does not need to merge with a lysosome (Figure 5.21).\n220\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 5.21 In pinocytosis, the cell membrane invaginates, surrounds a small volume of fluid, and pinches off. (credit:\nMariana Ruiz Villareal)\nA variation of pinocytosis is called potocytosis. This process uses a coating protein, called caveolin, on the cytoplasmic\nside of the plasma membrane, which performs a similar function to clathrin. The cavities in the plasma membrane that form\nthe vacuoles have membrane receptors and lipid rafts in addition to caveolin. The vacuoles or vesicles formed in caveolae\n(singular caveola) are smaller than those in pinocytosis. Potocytosis is used to bring small molecules into the cell and to\ntransport these molecules through the cell for their release on the other side of the cell, a process called transcytosis.\nReceptor-mediated Endocytosis\nA targeted variation of endocytosis employs receptor proteins in the plasma membrane that have a specific binding affinity\nfor certain substances (Figure 5.22).\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\n221\nFigure 5.22 In receptor-mediated endocytosis, uptake of substances by the cell is targeted to a single type of\nsubstance that binds to the receptor on the external surface of the cell membrane. (credit: modification of work by\nMariana Ruiz Villareal)\nIn receptor-mediated endocytosis, as in phagocytosis, clathrin is attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane.\nIf uptake of a compound is dependent on receptor-mediated endocytosis and the process is ineffective, the material will\nnot be removed from the tissue fluids or blood. Instead, it will stay in those fluids and increase in concentration. Some\nhuman diseases are caused by the failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis. For example, the form of cholesterol termed\nlow-density lipoprotein or LDL (also referred to as \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol) is removed from the blood by receptor-mediated\nendocytosis. In the human genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDL receptors are defective or missing\nentirely. People with this condition have life-threatening levels of cholesterol in their blood, because their cells cannot clear\nLDL particles from their blood.\nAlthough receptor-mediated endocytosis is designed to bring specific substances that are normally found in the extracellular\nfluid into the cell, other substances may gain entry into the cell at the same site. Flu viruses, diphtheria, and cholera toxin\nall have sites that cross-react with normal receptor-binding sites and gain entry into cells.\n222\nChapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nSee receptor-mediated endocytosis in action, and click on different parts (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/endocytosis) for\na focused animation.\nSalmonella is one of the most common food borne illnesses. When salmonella bacteria are engulfed by a white blood\ncell during phagocytosis, it secretes a protein that prevents the fusion of the encased bacteria with the lysosome of the\ncell. What effect would this have?\na.\nThe bacteria will be destroyed and will not cause any illness.\nb.\nThe bacteria will survive and will definitely result in illness.\nc.\nThe bacteria will be destroyed, but will still cause illness.\nd.\nThe bacteria will survive and possibly will cause illness.\nExocytosis\nThe reverse process of moving material into a cell is the process of exocytosis. Exocytosis is the opposite of the processes\ndiscussed above in that its purpose is to expel material from the cell into the extracellular fluid. Waste material is enveloped\nin a membrane and fuses with the interior of the plasma membrane. This fusion opens the membranous envelope on\nthe exterior of the cell, and the waste material is expelled into the extracellular space (Figure 5.23). Other examples\nof cells releasing molecules via exocytosis include the secretion of proteins of the extracellular matrix and secretion of\nneurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft by synaptic vesicles.\nFigure 5.23 In exocytosis, vesicles containing substances fuse with the plasma membrane. The contents are then\nreleased to the exterior of the cell.

        "summary": "Bulk transport is a form of active transport used by cells to move large molecules or particles that cannot pass through the plasma membrane, requiring energy for the process. Endocytosis brings substances into the cell by engulfing them in membrane-bound vesicles and occurs in three forms: phagocytosis (\u201ccell eating\u201d), where cells like neutrophils engulf large particles or microorganisms; pinocytosis (\u201ccell drinking\u201d), which takes in extracellular fluid and dissolved molecules in small vesicles; and receptor-mediated endocytosis, which targets specific substances via receptor proteins, with failures in this process linked to diseases such as familial hypercholesterolemia. Variations like potocytosis use caveolin-coated pits for uptake and transcytosis. In contrast, exocytosis expels materials from the cell by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane, releasing contents such as wastes, extracellular matrix proteins, or neurotransmitters into the extracellular space."

Energy is needed to perform heavy labor and exercise.\nHumans also use a great deal of energy while thinking and even during sleep. In fact, the living cells of every organism\nconstantly use energy. Nutrients and other molecules are imported, metabolized (broken down), synthesized into new\nmolecules, modified if needed, transported around the cell, and, in some cases, distributed to the entire organism. For\nexample, the large proteins that make up muscles are actively built from smaller molecules. Complex carbohydrates are\nbroken down into simple sugars that the cell uses for energy. Just as energy is required to both build and demolish a building,\nenergy is required for both the synthesis and breakdown of molecules. Additionally, signaling molecules such as hormones\nand neurotransmitters are actively transported between cells. Pathogenic bacteria and viruses are ingested and broken down\nby cells. Cells must also export waste and toxins to stay healthy. Many cells swim or move surrounding materials via the\nbeating motion of cellular appendages such as cilia and flagella.\nAll of the cellular processes listed above require a steady supply of energy. From where, and in what form, does this energy\ncome? How do living cells obtain energy and how do they use it? This chapter will discuss different forms of energy and\nthe physical laws that govern energy transfer.\nHow enzymes lower the activation energy required to begin a chemical reaction in the body will also be discussed in this\nchapter. Enzymes are crucial for life; without them the chemical reactions required to survive would not happen fast enough\nfor an organism to survive. For example, in an individual who lacks one of the enzymes needed to break down a type of\ncarbohydrate known as a mucopolysaccharide, waste products accumulate in the cells and cause progressive brain damage.\nThis deadly genetic disease is called Sanfilippo Syndrome type B or Mucopolysaccharidosis III. Previously incurable,\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\n237\nscientists have now discovered a way to replace the missing enzyme in the brain of mice.

A cell\u2019s metabolism refers\nto the chemical reactions that occur within it. Some metabolic reactions involve the breaking down of complex molecules\ninto simpler ones with a release of energy (catabolism), whereas other metabolic reactions require energy to build complex\nmolecules (anabolism). A central example of these pathways is the synthesis and breakdown of glucose.\nThe content presented in this section supports the Learning Objectives outlined in Big Idea 1 and Big Idea 2 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework listed below.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 2.1][APLO 2.3][APLO 4.3][APLO 4.15][APLO 4.17][APLO 2.21]\nScientists use the term bioenergetics to discuss the concept of energy flow (Figure 6.2) through living systems, such as\ncells. Cellular processes such as the building and breaking down of complex molecules occur through stepwise chemical\nreactions. Some of these chemical reactions are spontaneous and release energy, whereas others require energy to proceed.\nJust as living things must continually consume food to replenish what has been used, cells must continually produce more\nenergy to replenish that used by the many energy-requiring chemical reactions that constantly take place. All of the chemical\nreactions that take place inside cells, including those that use energy and those that release energy, are the cell\u2019s metabolism.\nFigure 6.2 Most life forms on earth get their energy from the sun. Plants use photosynthesis to capture sunlight, and\nherbivores eat those plants to obtain energy. Carnivores eat the herbivores, and decomposers digest plant and animal\nmatter.\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\n239\nMetabolism of Carbohydrates\nThe metabolism of sugar (a simple carbohydrate) is a classic example of the many cellular processes that use and produce\nenergy. Living things consume sugar as a major energy source, because sugar molecules have a great deal of energy stored\nwithin their bonds. The breakdown of glucose, a simple sugar, is described by the equation:\nC6 H12 O6 + 6O2 \u21926CO2 + 6H2 O + energy\nCarbohydrates that are consumed have their origins in photosynthesizing organisms like plants (Figure 6.3). During\nphotosynthesis, plants use the energy of sunlight to convert carbon dioxide gas (CO2) into sugar molecules, like glucose\n(C6H12O6). Because this process involves synthesizing a larger, energy-storing molecule, it requires an input of energy to\nproceed. The synthesis of glucose is described by this equation (notice that it is the reverse of the previous equation):\n6CO2 + 6H2 O + energy \u2192C6 H12 O6 + 6O2\nDuring the chemical reactions of photosynthesis, energy is provided in the form of a very high-energy molecule called ATP,\nor adenosine triphosphate, which is the primary energy currency of all cells. Just as the dollar is used as currency to buy\ngoods, cells use molecules of ATP as energy currency to perform immediate work. The sugar (glucose) is stored as starch\nor glycogen. Energy-storing polymers like these are broken down into glucose to supply molecules of ATP.\nSolar energy is required to synthesize a molecule of glucose during the reactions of photosynthesis. In photosynthesis, light\nenergy from the sun is initially transformed into chemical energy that is temporally stored in the energy carrier molecules\nATP and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). The stored energy in ATP and NADPH is then used\nlater in photosynthesis to build one molecule of glucose from six molecules of CO2. This process is analogous to eating\nbreakfast in the morning to acquire energy for your body that can be used later in the day. Under ideal conditions, energy\nfrom 18 molecules of ATP is required to synthesize one molecule of glucose during the reactions of photosynthesis. Glucose\nmolecules can also be combined with and converted into other types of sugars. When sugars are consumed, molecules of\nglucose eventually make their way into each living cell of the organism. Inside the cell, each sugar molecule is broken down\nthrough a complex series of chemical reactions. The goal of these reactions is to harvest the energy stored inside the sugar\nmolecules. The harvested energy is used to make high-energy ATP molecules, which can be used to perform work, powering\nmany chemical reactions in the cell. The amount of energy needed to make one molecule of glucose from six molecules of\ncarbon dioxide is 18 molecules of ATP and 12 molecules of NADPH (each one of which is energetically equivalent to three\nmolecules of ATP), or a total of 54 ATP molecule equivalents required for the synthesis of one molecule of glucose. This\nprocess is a fundamental and efficient way for cells to generate the molecular energy that they require.\nFigure 6.3 Plants, like this oak tree, use energy from sunlight to make sugar and other organic molecules. Both plants\nand animals, like this squirrel, use cellular respiration to derive energy from the organic molecules originally produced\nby plants.\nMetabolic Pathways\nThe processes of making and breaking down sugar molecules illustrate two types of metabolic pathways. A metabolic\npathway is a series of interconnected biochemical reactions that convert a substrate molecule or molecules, step-by-step,\nthrough a series of metabolic intermediates, eventually yielding a final product or products. In the case of sugar metabolism,\nthe first metabolic pathway synthesized sugar from smaller molecules, and the other pathway broke sugar down into smaller\n240\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nmolecules. These two opposite processes\u2014the first requiring energy and the second producing energy\u2014are referred to\nas anabolic (building) and catabolic (breaking down) pathways, respectively. Consequently, metabolism is composed of\nbuilding (anabolism) and degradation (catabolism).\nFigure 6.4 This tree shows the evolution of the various branches of life. The vertical dimension is time. Early life\nforms, in blue, used anaerobic metabolism to obtain energy from their surroundings.\nEvolution of Metabolic Pathways\nThere is more to the complexity of metabolism than understanding the metabolic pathways alone. Metabolic\ncomplexity varies from organism to organism. Photosynthesis is the primary pathway in which\nphotosynthetic organisms like plants (the majority of global synthesis is done by planktonic algae) harvest\nthe sun\u2019s energy and convert it into carbohydrates. The by-product of photosynthesis is oxygen, required\nby some cells to carry out cellular respiration. During cellular respiration, oxygen aids in the catabolic\nbreakdown of carbon compounds, like carbohydrates. Among the products of this catabolism are CO2 and\nATP. In addition, some eukaryotes perform catabolic processes without oxygen (fermentation); that is, they\nperform or use anaerobic metabolism.\nOrganisms probably evolved anaerobic metabolism to survive (living organisms came into existence about\n3.8 billion years ago, when the atmosphere lacked oxygen). Despite the differences between organisms\nand the complexity of metabolism, researchers have found that all branches of life share some of the\nsame metabolic pathways, suggesting that all organisms evolved from the same ancient common ancestor\n(Figure 6.4). Evidence indicates that over time, the pathways diverged, adding specialized enzymes to\nallow organisms to better adapt to their environment, thus increasing their chance to survive. However, the\nunderlying principle remains that all organisms must harvest energy from their environment and convert it\nto ATP to carry out cellular functions.\nThe early atmosphere lacked oxygen. Why do you think this is the case?\na.\nOxygen is a byproduct of photosynthesis, so there was very little oxygen in the atmosphere until\nphotosynthetic organisms evolved.\nb.\nOxygen is a byproduct of anaerobic respiration, so there was very little oxygen in the atmosphere until\nanaerobic organisms evolved.\nc.\nOxygen is a byproduct of fermentation, so there was very little oxygen in the atmosphere until fermentative\norganisms evolved.\nAnabolic and Catabolic Pathways\nAnabolic pathways require an input of energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones. Synthesizing sugar from\nCO2 is one example. Other examples are the synthesis of large proteins from amino acid building blocks, and the synthesis\nof new DNA strands from nucleic acid building blocks.

        "summary": "Energy and metabolism encompass all the chemical reactions within a cell that are necessary for life, collectively known as metabolism, which includes both energy-requiring anabolic pathways that build complex molecules from simpler ones, and energy-releasing catabolic pathways that break down complex molecules into simpler components. Organisms obtain energy through processes such as photosynthesis, in which light energy is transformed into chemical energy stored in molecules like ATP and NADPH for later use in synthesizing glucose, and cellular respiration, in which glucose is broken down to produce ATP. These metabolic pathways, which may be aerobic or anaerobic, are conserved across all forms of life, indicating a common evolutionary origin, and are facilitated by enzymes that catalyze each reaction step. The balance and interplay of anabolic and catabolic processes enable cells to capture, store, and convert energy to perform essential functions such as growth, reproduction, and maintenance."

Energy is available in different forms. For example, objects in motion possess kinetic energy,\nwhereas objects that are not in motion possess potential energy.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 2.5]\nEnergy is defined as the ability to do work. As you\u2019ve learned, energy exists in different forms. For example, electrical\nenergy, light energy, and heat energy are all different types of energy. While these are all familiar types of energy that one\ncan see or feel, there is another type of energy that is much less tangible. This energy is associated with something as simple\nas an object held above the ground. In order to appreciate the way energy flows into and out of biological systems, it is\nimportant to understand more about the different types of energy that exist in the physical world.\nTypes of Energy\nWhen an object is in motion, there is energy associated with that object. In the example of an airplane in flight, there is a\ngreat deal of energy associated with the motion of the airplane. This is because moving objects are capable of enacting a\nchange, or doing work. Think of a wrecking ball. Even a slow-moving wrecking ball can do a great deal of damage to other\nobjects. However, a wrecking ball that is not in motion is incapable of performing work. Energy associated with objects in\nmotion is called kinetic energy. A speeding bullet, a walking person, the rapid movement of molecules in the air (which\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\n243\nproduces heat), and electromagnetic radiation like light all have kinetic energy.\nNow what if that same motionless wrecking ball is lifted two stories above a car with a crane? If the suspended wrecking\nball is unmoving, is there energy associated with it? The answer is yes. The suspended wrecking ball has energy associated\nwith it that is fundamentally different from the kinetic energy of objects in motion. This form of energy results from the\nfact that there is the potential for the wrecking ball to do work. If it is released, indeed it would do work. Because this type\nof energy refers to the potential to do work, it is called potential energy. Objects transfer their energy between kinetic and\npotential in the following way: As the wrecking ball hangs motionless, it has 0 kinetic and 100 percent potential energy.\nOnce it is released, its kinetic energy begins to increase because it builds speed due to gravity. At the same time, as it nears\nthe ground, it loses potential energy. Somewhere mid-fall it has 50 percent kinetic and 50 percent potential energy. Just\nbefore it hits the ground, the ball has nearly lost its potential energy and has near-maximal kinetic energy. Other examples of\npotential energy include the energy of water held behind a dam (Figure 6.6), or a person about to skydive out of an airplane.\nFigure 6.6 Water behind a dam has potential energy. Moving water, such as in a waterfall or a rapidly flowing river, has\nkinetic energy. (credit \u201cdam\u201d: modification of work by \"Pascal\"/Flickr; credit \u201cwaterfall\u201d: modification of work by Frank\nGualtieri)\nPotential energy is not only associated with the location of matter (such as a child sitting on a tree branch), but also with the\nstructure of matter. A spring on the ground has potential energy if it is compressed; so does a rubber band that is pulled taut.\nThe very existence of living cells relies heavily on structural potential energy. On a chemical level, the bonds that hold the\natoms of molecules together have potential energy. Remember that anabolic cellular pathways require energy to synthesize\ncomplex molecules from simpler ones, and catabolic pathways release energy when complex molecules are broken down.\nThe fact that energy can be released by the breakdown of certain chemical bonds implies that those bonds have potential\nenergy. In fact, there is potential energy stored within the bonds of all the food molecules we eat, which is eventually\nharnessed for use. This is because these bonds can release energy when broken. The type of potential energy that exists\nwithin chemical bonds, and is released when those bonds are broken, is called chemical energy (Figure 6.7). Chemical\nenergy is responsible for providing living cells with energy from food. The release of energy is brought about by breaking\nthe molecular bonds within fuel molecules.\n244\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 6.7 The molecules in gasoline (octane, the chemical formula shown) contain chemical energy within the\nchemical bonds.

How can the energy released from\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\n245\none reaction be compared to that of another reaction? A measurement of free energy is used to quantitate these energy\ntransfers. Free energy is called Gibbs free energy (abbreviated with the letter G) after Josiah Willard Gibbs, the scientist\nwho developed the measurement. Recall that according to the second law of thermodynamics, all energy transfers involve\nthe loss of some amount of energy in an unusable form such as heat, resulting in entropy. Gibbs free energy specifically\nrefers to the energy associated with a chemical reaction that is available after entropy is accounted for. In other words, Gibbs\nfree energy is usable energy, or energy that is available to do work.\nEvery chemical reaction involves a change in free energy, called delta G (\u2206G). The change in free energy can be calculated\nfor any system that undergoes such a change, such as a chemical reaction. To calculate \u2206G, subtract the amount of energy\nlost to entropy (denoted as \u2206S) from the total energy change of the system. This total energy change in the system is called\nenthalpy and is denoted as \u2206H . The formula for calculating \u2206G is as follows, where the symbol T refers to absolute\ntemperature in Kelvin (degrees Celsius + 273):\n\u0394G = \u0394H \u2212T\u0394S\nThe standard free energy change of a chemical reaction is expressed as an amount of energy per mole of the reaction product\n(either in kilojoules or kilocalories, kJ/mol or kcal/mol; 1 kJ = 0.239 kcal) under standard pH, temperature, and pressure\nconditions. Standard pH, temperature, and pressure conditions are generally calculated at pH 7.0 in biological systems,\n25 degrees Celsius, and 100 kilopascals (1 atm pressure), respectively. It is important to note that cellular conditions vary\nconsiderably from these standard conditions, and so standard calculated \u2206G values for biological reactions will be different\ninside the cell.\nEndergonic Reactions and Exergonic Reactions\nIf energy is released during a chemical reaction, then the resulting value from the above equation will be a negative number.\nIn other words, reactions that release energy have a \u2206G < 0. A negative \u2206G also means that the products of the reaction\nhave less free energy than the reactants, because they gave off some free energy during the reaction. Reactions that have a\nnegative \u2206G and consequently release free energy are called exergonic reactions. Think: exergonic means energy is exiting\nthe system. These reactions are also referred to as spontaneous reactions, because they can occur without the addition of\nenergy into the system. Understanding which chemical reactions are spontaneous and release free energy is extremely useful\nfor biologists, because these reactions can be harnessed to perform work inside the cell. An important distinction must be\ndrawn between the term spontaneous and the idea of a chemical reaction that occurs immediately. Contrary to the everyday\nuse of the term, a spontaneous reaction is not one that suddenly or quickly occurs. The rusting of iron is an example of a\nspontaneous reaction that occurs slowly, little by little, over time.\nIf a chemical reaction requires an input of energy rather than releasing energy, then the \u2206G for that reaction will be a\npositive value. In this case, the products have more free energy than the reactants. Thus, the products of these reactions can\nbe thought of as energy-storing molecules. These chemical reactions are called endergonic reactions, and they are non-\nspontaneous. An endergonic reaction will not take place on its own without the addition of free energy.\nLet\u2019s revisit the example of the synthesis and breakdown of the food molecule, glucose. Remember that the building of\ncomplex molecules, such as sugars, from simpler ones is an anabolic process and requires energy. Therefore, the chemical\nreactions involved in anabolic processes are endergonic reactions. On the other hand, the catabolic process of breaking\nsugar down into simpler molecules releases energy in a series of exergonic reactions. Like the example of rust above, the\nbreakdown of sugar involves spontaneous reactions, but these reactions don\u2019t occur instantaneously. Figure 6.8 shows some\nother examples of endergonic and exergonic reactions. Later sections will provide more information about what else is\nrequired to make even spontaneous reactions happen more efficiently.\n246\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 6.8 Shown are some examples of endergonic processes (ones that require energy) and exergonic\nprocesses (ones that release energy).

A ball rolling downhill is exergonic process,\nenthalpy decreases and entropy increases.\nd.\nA ball rolling down the hill doesn\u2019t affect the order of system; therefore, the entropy would remain\nunchanged.\nAn important concept in the study of metabolism and energy is that of chemical equilibrium. Most chemical reactions are\nreversible. They can proceed in both directions, releasing energy into their environment in one direction, and absorbing\nit from the environment in the other direction (Figure 6.9). The same is true for the chemical reactions involved in cell\nmetabolism, such as the breaking down and building up of proteins into and from individual amino acids, respectively.\nReactants within a closed system will undergo chemical reactions in both directions until a state of equilibrium is reached.\nThis state of equilibrium is one of the lowest possible free energy and a state of maximal entropy. Energy must be put\ninto the system to push the reactants and products away from a state of equilibrium. Either reactants or products must\n248\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nbe added, removed, or changed. If a cell were a closed system, its chemical reactions would reach equilibrium, and it\nwould die because there would be insufficient free energy left to perform the work needed to maintain life. In a living\ncell, chemical reactions are constantly moving towards equilibrium, but never reach it. This is because a living cell is an\nopen system. Materials pass in and out, the cell recycles the products of certain chemical reactions into other reactions, and\nchemical equilibrium is never reached. In this way, living organisms are in a constant energy-requiring, uphill battle against\nequilibrium and entropy. This constant supply of energy ultimately comes from sunlight, which is used to produce nutrients\nin the process of photosynthesis.\nFigure 6.9 Exergonic and endergonic reactions result in changes in Gibbs free energy. Exergonic reactions release\nenergy; endergonic reactions require energy to proceed.\nActivation Energy\nThere is another important concept that must be considered regarding endergonic and exergonic reactions. Even exergonic\nreactions require a small amount of energy input to get going before they can proceed with their energy-releasing steps.\nThese reactions have a net release of energy, but still require some energy in the beginning. This small amount of energy\ninput necessary for all chemical reactions to occur is called the activation energy (or free energy of activation) and is\nabbreviated EA (Figure 6.10).\nWhy would an energy-releasing, negative \u2206G reaction actually require some energy to proceed? The reason lies in the\nsteps that take place during a chemical reaction. During chemical reactions, certain chemical bonds are broken and new\nones are formed. For example, when a glucose molecule is broken down, bonds between the carbon atoms of the molecule\nare broken. Since these are energy-storing bonds, they release energy when broken. However, to get them into a state that\nallows the bonds to break, the molecule must be somewhat contorted. A small energy input is required to achieve this\ncontorted state. This contorted state is called the transition state, and it is a high-energy, unstable state. For this reason,\nreactant molecules don\u2019t last long in their transition state, but very quickly proceed to the next steps of the chemical reaction.\nFree energy diagrams illustrate the energy profiles for a given reaction. Whether the reaction is exergonic or endergonic\ndetermines whether the products in the diagram will exist at a lower or higher energy state than both the reactants and the\nproducts. However, regardless of this measure, the transition state of the reaction exists at a higher energy state than the\nreactants, and thus, EA is always positive.\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\n249\nWatch an animation of the move from free energy to transition state at this (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/\nenergy_reaction) site.\nExplain why transitional states are unstable.\na.\nMolecules have relaxed molecular structure with low energy.\nb.\nMolecules have strained molecular structure with high energy.\nc.\nMolecules have relaxed molecular structure with high energy.\nd.\nMolecules have strained molecular structure with low energy.\nWhere does the activation energy required by chemical reactants come from? The source of the activation energy needed\nto push reactions forward is typically heat energy from the surroundings. Heat energy (the total bond energy of reactants\nor products in a chemical reaction) speeds up the motion of molecules, increasing the frequency and force with which they\ncollide; it also moves atoms and bonds within the molecule slightly, helping them reach their transition state. For this reason,\nheating up a system will cause chemical reactants within that system to react more frequently. Increasing the pressure on a\nsystem has the same effect. Once reactants have absorbed enough heat energy from their surroundings to reach the transition\nstate, the reaction will proceed.\nThe activation energy of a particular reaction determines the rate at which it will proceed. The higher the activation energy,\nthe slower the chemical reaction will be. The example of iron rusting illustrates an inherently slow reaction. This reaction\noccurs slowly over time because of its high EA. Additionally, the burning of many fuels, which is strongly exergonic, will\ntake place at a negligible rate unless their activation energy is overcome by sufficient heat from a spark. Once they begin to\nburn, however, the chemical reactions release enough heat to continue the burning process, supplying the activation energy\nfor surrounding fuel molecules. Like these reactions outside of cells, the activation energy for most cellular reactions is\ntoo high for heat energy to overcome at efficient rates. In other words, in order for important cellular reactions to occur\nat appreciable rates (number of reactions per unit time), their activation energies must be lowered (Figure 6.10); this is\nreferred to as catalysis. This is a very good thing as far as living cells are concerned. Important macromolecules, such\nas proteins, DNA, and RNA, store considerable energy, and their breakdown is exergonic. If cellular temperatures alone\nprovided enough heat energy for these exergonic reactions to overcome their activation barriers, the essential components\nof a cell would disintegrate.\n250\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 6.10 Activation energy is the energy required for a reaction to proceed, and it is lower if the reaction is\ncatalyzed. The horizontal axis of this diagram describes the sequence of events in time.\nHow does the change in Gibbs free energy (\u0394G) differ between the catalyzed versus uncatalyzed reaction?\na.\n\u0394G is greater for the forward direction than for the reverse direction.\nb.\n\u0394G is greater for the uncatalyzed than the catalyzed reaction.\nc.\n\u0394G is greater for the catalyzed than the uncatalyzed reaction.\nd.\n\u0394G is the same for the catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions.\nThink About It\nAll plants use water, carbon dioxide, and energy from the sun to make sugars. Think about what would happen to plants\nthat do not have sunlight as an energy source or sufficient water. What would happen to organisms that depend on\nthose plants for their own survival? How does depletion or destruction of forests by human activity affect free energy\navailability to organisms living in the rain forest? What measures can be taken to try and restore the free energy to an\nacceptable level?\nSection Summary\nEnergy comes in many different forms. Objects in motion do physical work, and kinetic energy is the energy of objects\nin motion. Objects that are not in motion may have the potential to do work, and thus, have potential energy. Molecules\nalso have potential energy because the breaking of molecular bonds has the potential to release energy. Living cells depend\non the harvesting of potential energy from molecular bonds to perform work. Free energy is a measure of energy that is\navailable to do work. The free energy of a system changes during energy transfers such as chemical reactions, and this\nchange is referred to as \u2206G.\nThe \u2206G of a reaction can be negative or positive, meaning that the reaction releases energy or consumes energy, respectively.\nA reaction with a negative \u2206G that gives off energy is called an exergonic reaction. One with a positive \u2206G that requires\nenergy input is called an endergonic reaction. Exergonic reactions are said to be spontaneous, because their products have\nless energy than their reactants. The products of endergonic reactions have a higher energy state than the reactants, and so\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\n251\nthese are nonspontaneous reactions. However, all reactions (including spontaneous \u2013\u2206G reactions) require an initial input\nof energy in order to reach the transition state, at which they\u2019ll proceed. This initial input of energy is called the activation\nenergy.\n6.3 | The Laws of Thermodynamics\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat is entropy?\n\u2022\nWhat is the difference between the first and second laws of thermodynamics?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nIn studying energy, scientists use the term system to refer to the matter and its environment involved in energy transfers,\nsuch as an ecosystem. Even single cells are biological systems and all systems require energy to maintain order. The more\nordered a system is, the lower its entropy. Entropy is a measure of the disorder of the system. (Think of your bedroom as a\nsystem. On Sunday evening, you throw dirty clothes in the laundry basket, put books back on the shelves, and return dirty\ndishes to the kitchen. Cleaning your room requires an input of energy. What gradually happens as the week progresses? You\nguessed it: entropy.) All biological systems obey the laws of chemistry and physics, including the laws of thermodynamics\nthat describe the properties and processes of energy transfer in systems. The first law states that the total amount of energy\nin the universe is constant; energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be transformed and transferred. The second\nlaw states that every energy transfer involves some loss of energy in an unusable form, such as heat energy, resulting in a\nmore disordered system (e.g., your bedroom over the course of a week). Thus, no energy transfer is completely efficient.\n(We will explore how free energy is stored, transferred, and used in more detail when we study photosynthesis and cellular\nrespiration.)\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section, support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined in\nBig Idea 2 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework.

Free energy, or Gibbs free energy (G), is the portion of a system\u2019s energy available to perform work after accounting for entropy, and its change (\u0394G) during a reaction determines whether the reaction is exergonic (\u0394G < 0, releases energy, spontaneous) or endergonic (\u0394G > 0, requires energy, nonspontaneous). Even spontaneous reactions require an initial activation energy (EA) to reach a high-energy transition state before proceeding. Activation energy often comes from heat in the surroundings and affects the reaction rate, with higher EA leading to slower reactions. Living systems avoid equilibrium by constantly exchanging materials and energy, enabling continuous metabolic processes that convert potential energy into work."

Even single cells are biological systems and all systems require energy to maintain order. The more\nordered a system is, the lower its entropy. Entropy is a measure of the disorder of the system. (Think of your bedroom as a\nsystem. On Sunday evening, you throw dirty clothes in the laundry basket, put books back on the shelves, and return dirty\ndishes to the kitchen. Cleaning your room requires an input of energy. What gradually happens as the week progresses? You\nguessed it: entropy.) All biological systems obey the laws of chemistry and physics, including the laws of thermodynamics\nthat describe the properties and processes of energy transfer in systems. The first law states that the total amount of energy\nin the universe is constant; energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be transformed and transferred. The second\nlaw states that every energy transfer involves some loss of energy in an unusable form, such as heat energy, resulting in a\nmore disordered system (e.g., your bedroom over the course of a week). Thus, no energy transfer is completely efficient.\n(We will explore how free energy is stored, transferred, and used in more detail when we study photosynthesis and cellular\nrespiration.)\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section, support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined in\nBig Idea 2 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework.

The matter and its\nenvironment relevant to a particular case of energy transfer are classified as a system, and everything outside of that system\nis called the surroundings. For instance, when heating a pot of water on the stove, the system includes the stove, the pot, and\nthe water. Energy is transferred within the system (between the stove, pot, and water). There are two types of systems: open\n252\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nand closed. An open system is one in which energy can be transferred between the system and its surroundings. The stovetop\nsystem is open because heat can be lost into the air. A closed system is one that cannot transfer energy to its surroundings.\nBiological organisms are open systems. Energy is exchanged between them and their surroundings, as they consume energy-\nstoring molecules and release energy to the environment by doing work. Like all things in the physical world, energy is\nsubject to the laws of physics. The laws of thermodynamics govern the transfer of energy in and among all systems in the\nuniverse.\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics\nThe first law of thermodynamics deals with the total amount of energy in the universe. It states that this total amount\nof energy is constant. In other words, there has always been, and always will be, exactly the same amount of energy\nin the universe. Energy exists in many different forms. According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy may be\ntransferred from place to place or transformed into different forms, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The transfers and\ntransformations of energy take place around us all the time. Light bulbs transform electrical energy into light energy. Gas\nstoves transform chemical energy from natural gas into heat energy. Plants perform one of the most biologically useful\nenergy transformations on earth: that of converting the energy of sunlight into the chemical energy stored within organic\nmolecules, as shown in Figure 6.2. Some examples of energy transformations are shown in Figure 6.11.\nThe challenge for all living organisms is to obtain energy from their surroundings in forms that they can transfer or\ntransform into usable energy to do work. Living cells have evolved to meet this challenge very well. Chemical energy stored\nwithin organic molecules such as sugars and fats is transformed through a series of cellular chemical reactions into energy\nwithin molecules of ATP. Energy in ATP molecules is easily accessible to do work. Examples of the types of work that cells\nneed to do include building complex molecules, transporting materials, powering the beating motion of cilia or flagella,\ncontracting muscle fibers to create movement, and reproduction.\nFigure 6.11 Shown are two examples of energy being transferred from one system to another and transformed from\none form to another. Humans can convert the chemical energy in food, like this ice cream cone, into kinetic energy\n(the energy of movement to ride a bicycle). Plants can convert electromagnetic radiation (light energy) from the sun\ninto chemical energy. (credit \u201cice cream\u201d: modification of work by D. Sharon Pruitt; credit \u201ckids on bikes\u201d: modification\nof work by Michelle Riggen-Ransom; credit \u201cleaf\u201d: modification of work by Cory Zanker)\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics\nA living cell\u2019s primary tasks of obtaining, transforming, and using energy to do work may seem simple. However,\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\n253\nthe second law of thermodynamics explains why these tasks are harder than they appear. None of the energy transfers\nwe\u2019ve discussed, along with all energy transfers and transformations in the universe, is completely efficient. In every\nenergy transfer, some amount of energy is lost in a form that is unusable. In most cases, this form is heat energy.\nThermodynamically, heat energy is defined as the energy transferred from one system to another that is not doing work.\nFor example, when an airplane flies through the air, some of the energy of the flying plane is lost as heat energy due to\nfriction with the surrounding air. This friction actually heats the air by temporarily increasing the speed of air molecules.\nLikewise, some energy is lost as heat energy during cellular metabolic reactions. This is good for warm-blooded creatures\nlike us, because heat energy helps to maintain our body temperature. Strictly speaking, no energy transfer is completely\nefficient, because some energy is lost in an unusable form.\nAn important concept in physical systems is that of order and disorder (also known as randomness). The more energy that\nis lost by a system to its surroundings, the less ordered and more random the system is. Scientists refer to the measure of\nrandomness or disorder within a system as entropy. High entropy means high disorder and low energy (Figure 6.12). To\nbetter understand entropy, think of a student\u2019s bedroom. If no energy or work were put into it, the room would quickly\nbecome messy. It would exist in a very disordered state, one of high entropy. Energy must be put into the system, in the form\nof the student doing work and putting everything away, in order to bring the room back to a state of cleanliness and order.\nThis state is one of low entropy. Similarly, a car or house must be constantly maintained with work in order to keep it in an\nordered state. Left alone, the entropy of the house or car gradually increases through rust and degradation. Molecules and\nchemical reactions have varying amounts of entropy as well. For example, as chemical reactions reach a state of equilibrium,\nentropy increases, and as molecules at a high concentration in one place diffuse and spread out, entropy also increases.\nTransfer of Energy and the Resulting Entropy\nSet up a simple experiment to understand how energy is transferred and how a change in entropy results.\n1.\nTake a block of ice. This is water in solid form, so it has a high structural order. This means that the\nmolecules cannot move very much and are in a fixed position. The temperature of the ice is 0\u00b0C. As a\nresult, the entropy of the system is low.\n2.\nAllow the ice to melt at room temperature. What is the state of molecules in the liquid water now? How\ndid the energy transfer take place? Is the entropy of the system higher or lower? Why?\n3.\nHeat the water to its boiling point. What happens to the entropy of the system when the water is\nheated?\nAll physical systems can be thought of in this way: Living things are highly ordered, requiring constant energy input to\nbe maintained in a state of low entropy. As living systems take in energy-storing molecules and transform them through\nchemical reactions, they lose some amount of usable energy in the process, because no reaction is completely efficient. They\nalso produce waste and by-products that aren\u2019t useful energy sources. This process increases the entropy of the system\u2019s\nsurroundings. Since all energy transfers result in the loss of some usable energy, the second law of thermodynamics states\nthat every energy transfer or transformation increases the entropy of the universe. Even though living things are highly\nordered and maintain a state of low entropy, the entropy of the universe in total is constantly increasing due to the loss of\nusable energy with each energy transfer that occurs. Essentially, living things are in a continuous uphill battle against this\nconstant increase in universal entropy.\n254\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 6.12 Entropy is a measure of randomness or disorder in a system.

When cells require an input of energy, they\nuse ATP. An ATP nucleotide molecule consists of a five-carbon sugar, the nitrogenous base adenine, and three phosphate\ngroups. (Do not confuse ATP with the nucleotides of DNA and RNA, although they have structural similarities.) The bonds\nthat connect the phosphate have high-energy content, and the energy released from the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP + Pi\n(Adenosine Diphosphate + Pyrophosphate) is used to perform cellular work, such as contracting a muscle or pumping a\nsolute across a cell membrane in active transport. Cells use ATP by coupling the exergonic reaction of ATP hydrolysis with\nendergonic reactions, with ATP donating its phosphate group to another molecule via a process called phosphorylation.\nThe phosphorylated molecule is at a higher energy state and is less stable than its unphosphorylated form and free energy\nis released to substrates to perform work during this process. Phosphorylation is an example of energy transfer between\nmolecules.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined in Big\nIdea 2 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 2.2][APLO 4.14][APLO 2.7][APLO 2.35]\nEven exergonic, energy-releasing reactions require a small amount of activation energy in order to proceed. However,\nconsider endergonic reactions, which require much more energy input, because their products have more free energy than\ntheir reactants. Within the cell, where does energy to power such reactions come from? The answer lies with an energy-\nsupplying molecule called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. ATP is a small, relatively simple molecule (Figure 6.13), but\nwithin some of its bonds, it contains the potential for a quick burst of energy that can be harnessed to perform cellular work.\nThis molecule can be thought of as the primary energy currency of cells in much the same way that money is the currency\nthat people exchange for things they need. ATP is used to power the majority of energy-requiring cellular reactions.\n256\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 6.13 ATP is the primary energy currency of the cell. It has an adenosine backbone with three phosphate groups\nattached.\nAs its name suggests, adenosine triphosphate is comprised of adenosine bound to three phosphate groups (Figure 6.13).\nAdenosine is a nucleoside consisting of the nitrogenous base adenine and a five-carbon sugar, ribose. The three phosphate\ngroups, in order of closest to furthest from the ribose sugar, are labeled alpha, beta, and gamma. Together, these chemical\ngroups constitute an energy powerhouse. However, not all bonds within this molecule exist in a particularly high-energy\nstate. Both bonds that link the phosphates are equally high-energy bonds ( phosphoanhydride bonds) that, when broken,\nrelease sufficient energy to power a variety of cellular reactions and processes. These high-energy bonds are the bonds\nbetween the second and third (or beta and gamma) phosphate groups and between the first and second phosphate groups.\nThe reason that these bonds are considered \u201chigh-energy\u201d is because the products of such bond breaking\u2014adenosine\ndiphosphate (ADP) and one inorganic phosphate group (Pi)\u2014have considerably lower free energy than the reactants: ATP\nand a water molecule. Because this reaction takes place with the use of a water molecule, it is considered a hydrolysis\nreaction. In other words, ATP is hydrolyzed into ADP in the following reaction:\nATP + H2 O \u2192ADP + Pi + free energy\nLike most chemical reactions, the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP is reversible. The reverse reaction regenerates ATP from ADP\n+ Pi. Indeed, cells rely on the regeneration of ATP just as people rely on the regeneration of spent money through some sort\nof income. Since ATP hydrolysis releases energy, ATP regeneration must require an input of free energy. The formation of\nATP is expressed in this equation:\nADP + Pi + free energy \u2192ATP + H2 O\nTwo prominent questions remain with regard to the use of ATP as an energy source. Exactly how much free energy is\nreleased with the hydrolysis of ATP, and how is that free energy used to do cellular work? The calculated \u2206G for the\nhydrolysis of one mole of ATP into ADP and Pi is \u22127.3 kcal/mole (\u221230.5 kJ/mol). Since this calculation is true under\nstandard conditions, it would be expected that a different value exists under cellular conditions. In fact, the \u2206G for the\nhydrolysis of one mole of ATP in a living cell is almost double the value at standard conditions: -14 kcal/mol (\u221257 kJ/mol).\nATP is a highly unstable molecule. Unless quickly used to perform work, ATP spontaneously dissociates into ADP + Pi, and\nthe free energy released during this process is lost as heat. The second question posed above, that is, how the energy released\nby ATP hydrolysis is used to perform work inside the cell, depends on a strategy called energy coupling. Cells couple the\nexergonic reaction of ATP hydrolysis with endergonic reactions, allowing them to proceed. One example of energy coupling\nusing ATP involves a transmembrane ion pump that is extremely important for cellular function. This sodium-potassium\npump (Na+/K+ pump) drives sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell (Figure 6.14). A large percentage of a cell\u2019s\nATP is spent powering this pump, because cellular processes bring a great deal of sodium into the cell and potassium out\nof the cell. The pump works constantly to stabilize cellular concentrations of sodium and potassium. In order for the pump\nto turn one cycle (exporting three Na+ ions and importing two K+ ions), one molecule of ATP must be hydrolyzed. When\nATP is hydrolyzed, its gamma phosphate doesn\u2019t simply float away, but is actually transferred onto the pump protein. This\nprocess of a phosphate group binding to a molecule is called phosphorylation. As with most cases of ATP hydrolysis, a\nphosphate from ATP is transferred onto another molecule. In a phosphorylated state, the Na+/K+ pump has more free energy\nand is triggered to undergo a conformational change. This change allows it to release Na+ to the outside of the cell. It\nthen binds extracellular K+, which, through another conformational change, causes the phosphate to detach from the pump.\nThis release of phosphate triggers the K+ to be released to the inside of the cell. Essentially, the energy released from the\nhydrolysis of ATP is coupled with the energy required to power the pump and transport Na+ and K+ ions. ATP performs\ncellular work using this basic form of energy coupling through phosphorylation.\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\n257\nFigure 6.14 The sodium-potassium pump is an example of energy coupling. The energy derived from exergonic\nATP hydrolysis is used to pump sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane.\nThe hydrolysis of one ATP molecule releases 7.3 kcal/mol of energy (\u0394G = \u22127.3 kcal/mol of energy ) .

One example is\nduring the very first steps of cellular respiration, when a molecule of the sugar glucose is broken down in the process\nof glycolysis. In the first step of this process, ATP is required for the phosphorylation of glucose, creating a high-energy\nbut unstable intermediate. This phosphorylation reaction powers a conformational change that allows the phosphorylated\nglucose molecule to be converted to the phosphorylated sugar fructose. Fructose is a necessary intermediate for glycolysis to\nmove forward. Here, the exergonic reaction of ATP hydrolysis is coupled with the endergonic reaction of converting glucose\ninto a phosphorylated intermediate in the pathway. Once again, the energy released by breaking a phosphate bond within\nATP was used for the phosphorylation of another molecule, creating an unstable intermediate and powering an important\nconformational change.\n258\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nSee an interactive animation of the ATP-producing glycolysis process at this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/\nglycolysis_stgs) .\nExplain why the lock-and-key model does not adequately represent the relationship between hexokinase and glucose.\na.\nHexokinase changes conformation in presence of glucose\nb.\nHexokinase induces change in the glucose structure\nc.\nHexokinase requires an effector molecule to bind at allosteric site\nd.\nHexokinase binds glucose without any conformational change\nThink About It\nThe hydrolysis of one ATP molecules releases 7.3 kcal/mol of energy (\u0394G = \u20137.3 kcal/mol energy).

After the reaction finishes, the\nproduct(s) are released, and the active site returns to its original shape.\nEnzyme activity, and thus the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, is regulated by environmental conditions, including\nthe amount of substrate, temperature, pH, and the presence of coenzymes, cofactors, activators, and inhibitors. Inhibitors,\ncoenzymes, and cofactors can act competitively by binding to the enzyme\u2019s active site, or noncompetitively by binding to\nthe enzyme\u2019s allosteric site. An allosteric site is an alternate part of the enzyme that can bind to non\u2013substrate molecules.\nEnzymes work most efficiently under optimal conditions that are specific to the enzyme. For example, trypsin, an enzyme in\nthe human small intestine, works most efficiently at pH 8, whereas pepsin in the stomach works best under acidic conditions.\nSometimes environmental factors, especially low pH and high temperatures, alter the shape of the active site; if the shape\ncannot be restored, the enzyme denatures. The most common method of enzyme regulation in metabolic pathways is via\nfeedback inhibition.\nHow can various factors, such as feedback inhibition, regulate enzyme activity?\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined in Big\nIdea 4 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 2.15][APLO 4.8][APLO 2.16]\nA substance that helps a chemical reaction to occur is a catalyst, and the special molecules that catalyze biochemical\nreactions are called enzymes. Almost all enzymes are proteins, made up of chains of amino acids, and they perform the\ncritical task of lowering the activation energies of chemical reactions inside the cell. Enzymes do this by binding to the\nreactant molecules, and holding them in such a way as to make the chemical bond-breaking and bond-forming processes\ntake place more readily. It is important to remember that enzymes don\u2019t change the \u2206G of a reaction. In other words, they\ndon\u2019t change whether a reaction is exergonic (spontaneous) or endergonic. This is because they don\u2019t change the free energy\nof the reactants or products. They only reduce the activation energy required to reach the transition state (Figure 6.15).\n260\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 6.15 Enzymes lower the activation energy of the reaction but do not change the free energy of the reaction.\nEnzyme Active Site and Substrate Specificity\nThe chemical reactants to which an enzyme binds are the enzyme\u2019s substrates. There may be one or more substrates,\ndepending on the particular chemical reaction. In some reactions, a single-reactant substrate is broken down into multiple\nproducts. In others, two substrates may come together to create one larger molecule. Two reactants might also enter a\nreaction, both become modified, and leave the reaction as two products. The location within the enzyme where the substrate\nbinds is called the enzyme\u2019s active site. The active site is where the \u201caction\u201d happens, so to speak. Since enzymes are\nproteins, there is a unique combination of amino acid residues (also called side chains, or R groups) within the active site.\nEach residue is characterized by different properties. Residues can be large or small, weakly acidic or basic, hydrophilic or\nhydrophobic, positively or negatively charged, or neutral. The unique combination of amino acid residues, their positions,\nsequences, structures, and properties, creates a very specific chemical environment within the active site. This specific\nenvironment is suited to bind, albeit briefly, to a specific chemical substrate (or substrates). Due to this jigsaw puzzle-like\nmatch between an enzyme and its substrates (which adapts to find the best fit between the transition state and the active\nsite), enzymes are known for their specificity. The \u201cbest fit\u201d results from the shape and the amino acid functional group\u2019s\nattraction to the substrate. There is a specifically matched enzyme for each substrate and, thus, for each chemical reaction;\nhowever, there is flexibility as well.\nThe fact that active sites are so perfectly suited to provide specific environmental conditions also means that they are subject\nto influences by the local environment. It is true that increasing the environmental temperature generally increases reaction\nrates, enzyme-catalyzed or otherwise. However, increasing or decreasing the temperature outside of an optimal range can\naffect chemical bonds within the active site in such a way that they are less well suited to bind substrates. High temperatures\nwill eventually cause enzymes, like other biological molecules, to denature, a process that changes the natural properties\nof a substance. Likewise, the pH of the local environment can also affect enzyme function. Active site amino acid residues\nhave their own acidic or basic properties that are optimal for catalysis. These residues are sensitive to changes in pH that\ncan impair the way substrate molecules bind. Enzymes are suited to function best within a certain pH range, and, as with\ntemperature, extreme pH values (acidic or basic) of the environment can cause enzymes to denature.\nInduced Fit and Enzyme Function\nFor many years, scientists thought that enzyme-substrate binding took place in a simple \u201clock-and-key\u201d fashion. This model\nasserted that the enzyme and substrate fit together perfectly in one instantaneous step. However, current research supports\na more refined view called induced fit (Figure 6.16). The induced-fit model expands upon the lock-and-key model by\ndescribing a more dynamic interaction between enzyme and substrate. As the enzyme and substrate come together, their\ninteraction causes a mild shift in the enzyme\u2019s structure that confirms an ideal binding arrangement between the enzyme\nand the transition state of the substrate. This ideal binding maximizes the enzyme\u2019s ability to catalyze its reaction.\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\n261\nView an animation of induced fit at this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/hexokinase) .\nPhosphofructokinase deficiency occurs when a person lacks an enzyme needed to perform glycolysis in skeletal\nmuscles. What effect could this have on the body?\na.\nProduction of energy by glycolysis will occur, skeletal muscles will function properly\nb.\nProduction of energy by glycolysis will not occur, skeletal muscles will function properly\nc.\nProduction of energy by glycolysis will occur, skeletal muscles will not function properly\nd.\nProduction of energy will not occur, skeletal muscles will not function properly\nWhen an enzyme binds its substrate, an enzyme-substrate complex is formed. This complex lowers the activation energy\nof the reaction and promotes its rapid progression in one of many ways. On a basic level, enzymes promote chemical\nreactions that involve more than one substrate by bringing the substrates together in an optimal orientation. The appropriate\nregion (atoms and bonds) of one molecule is juxtaposed to the appropriate region of the other molecule with which it must\nreact. Another way in which enzymes promote the reaction of their substrates is by creating an optimal environment within\nthe active site for the reaction to occur. Certain chemical reactions might proceed best in a slightly acidic or non-polar\nenvironment. The chemical properties that emerge from the particular arrangement of amino acid residues within an active\nsite create the perfect environment for an enzyme\u2019s specific substrates to react.\nYou\u2019ve learned that the activation energy required for many reactions includes the energy involved in manipulating or\nslightly contorting chemical bonds so that they can easily break and allow others to reform. Enzymatic action can aid this\nprocess. The enzyme-substrate complex can lower the activation energy by contorting substrate molecules in such a way\nas to facilitate bond-breaking, helping to reach the transition state. Finally, enzymes can also lower activation energies by\ntaking part in the chemical reaction itself. The amino acid residues can provide certain ions or chemical groups that actually\nform covalent bonds with substrate molecules as a necessary step of the reaction process. In these cases, it is important to\nremember that the enzyme will always return to its original state at the completion of the reaction. One of the hallmark\nproperties of enzymes is that they remain ultimately unchanged by the reactions they catalyze. After an enzyme is done\ncatalyzing a reaction, it releases its product(s).\nFigure 6.16 According to the induced-fit model, both enzyme and substrate undergo dynamic conformational changes\nupon binding. The enzyme contorts the substrate into its transition state, thereby increasing the rate of the reaction.\n262\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nActivity\nAP Biology Investigation 13: Enzyme Activity. This investigation allows you to design and conduct experiments to\nexplore the effects of environmental variables, such as temperature and pH, on the rates of enzymatic reactions.\nControl of Metabolism Through Enzyme Regulation\nIt would seem ideal to have a scenario in which all of the enzymes encoded in an organism\u2019s genome existed in abundant\nsupply and functioned optimally under all cellular conditions, in all cells, at all times. In reality, this is far from the case.\nA variety of mechanisms ensure that this does not happen. Cellular needs and conditions vary from cell to cell, and change\nwithin individual cells over time. The required enzymes and energetic demands of stomach cells are different from those\nof fat storage cells, skin cells, blood cells, and nerve cells. Furthermore, a digestive cell works much harder to process and\nbreak down nutrients during the time that closely follows a meal compared with many hours after a meal. As these cellular\ndemands and conditions vary, so do the amounts and functionality of different enzymes.\nSince the rates of biochemical reactions are controlled by activation energy, and enzymes lower and determine activation\nenergies for chemical reactions, the relative amounts and functioning of the variety of enzymes within a cell ultimately\ndetermine which reactions will proceed and at which rates. This determination is tightly controlled. In certain cellular\nenvironments, enzyme activity is partly controlled by environmental factors, like pH and temperature. There are other\nmechanisms through which cells control the activity of enzymes and determine the rates at which various biochemical\nreactions will occur.\nRegulation of Enzymes by Molecules\nEnzymes can be regulated in ways that either promote or reduce their activity. There are many different kinds of molecules\nthat inhibit or promote enzyme function, and various mechanisms exist for doing so. In some cases of enzyme inhibition,\nfor example, an inhibitor molecule is similar enough to a substrate that it can bind to the active site and simply block the\nsubstrate from binding. When this happens, the enzyme is inhibited through competitive inhibition, because an inhibitor\nmolecule competes with the substrate for active site binding (Figure 6.17). On the other hand, in noncompetitive inhibition,\nan inhibitor molecule binds to the enzyme in a location other than an allosteric site and still manages to block substrate\nbinding to the active site.\nFigure 6.17 Competitive and noncompetitive inhibition affect the rate of reaction differently. Competitive inhibitors\naffect the initial rate but do not affect the maximal rate, whereas noncompetitive inhibitors affect the maximal rate.\nSome inhibitor molecules bind to enzymes in a location where their binding induces a conformational change that reduces\nthe affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. This type of inhibition is called allosteric inhibition (Figure 6.18). Most\nallosterically regulated enzymes are made up of more than one polypeptide, meaning that they have more than one protein\nsubunit. When an allosteric inhibitor binds to an enzyme, all active sites on the protein subunits are changed slightly such\nthat they bind their substrates with less efficiency. There are allosteric activators as well as inhibitors. Allosteric activators\nbind to locations on an enzyme away from the active site, inducing a conformational change that increases the affinity of\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\n263\nthe enzyme\u2019s active site(s) for its substrate(s).\nFigure 6.18 Allosteric inhibitors modify the active site of the enzyme so that substrate binding is reduced or prevented.\nIn contrast, allosteric activators modify the active site of the enzyme so that the affinity for the substrate increases.\n264\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 6.19 Have you ever wondered how pharmaceutical drugs are developed? (credit: Deborah Austin)\nDrug Discovery by Looking for Inhibitors of Key Enzymes in\nSpecific Pathways\nEnzymes are key components of metabolic pathways. Understanding how enzymes work and how they can\nbe regulated is a key principle behind the development of many of the pharmaceutical drugs (Figure 6.19)\non the market today. Biologists working in this field collaborate with other scientists, usually chemists, to\ndesign drugs.\nConsider statins for example\u2014which is the name given to the class of drugs that reduces cholesterol levels.\nThese compounds are essentially inhibitors of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. HMG-CoA reductase is\nthe enzyme that synthesizes cholesterol from lipids in the body. By inhibiting this enzyme, the levels of\ncholesterol synthesized in the body can be reduced. Similarly, acetaminophen is an inhibitor of the enzyme\ncyclooxygenase. While it is effective in providing relief from fever and inflammation (pain), its mechanism of\naction is still not completely understood.\nHow are drugs developed? One of the first challenges in drug development is identifying the specific\nmolecule that the drug is intended to target. In the case of statins, HMG-CoA reductase is the drug target.\nDrug targets are identified through painstaking research in the laboratory. Identifying the target alone is not\nsufficient; scientists also need to know how the target acts inside the cell and which reactions go awry in\nthe case of disease. Once the target and the pathway are identified, then the actual process of drug design\nbegins. During this stage, chemists and biologists work together to design and synthesize molecules that\ncan either block or activate a particular reaction. However, this is only the beginning: both if and when a drug\nprototype is successful in performing its function, then it must undergo many tests from in vitro experiments\nto clinical trials before it can get FDA approval to be on the market.\nStatins reduce the level of cholesterol in the blood. Based on the everyday connection, which of the following might\nalso reduce cholesterol levels in the blood?\na.\na drug that increases HMG-CoA reductase levels\nb.\na drug that reduces cyclooxygenase levels\nc.\na drug that reduces lipid levels in the body\nd.\na drug that blocks the action of acetaminophen\nMany enzymes don\u2019t work optimally, or even at all, unless bound to other specific non-protein helper molecules, either\ntemporarily through ionic or hydrogen bonds or permanently through stronger covalent bonds. Two types of helper\nmolecules are cofactors and coenzymes. Binding to these molecules promotes optimal conformation and function for their\nrespective enzymes. Cofactors are inorganic ions such as iron (Fe++) and magnesium (Mg++). One example of an enzyme\nthat requires a metal ion as a cofactor is the enzyme that builds DNA molecules, DNA polymerase, which requires a bound\nzinc ion (Zn++) to function. Coenzymes are organic helper molecules, with a basic atomic structure made up of carbon and\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\n265\nhydrogen, which are required for enzyme action. The most common sources of coenzymes are dietary vitamins (Figure\n6.20). Some vitamins are precursors to coenzymes and others act directly as coenzymes. Vitamin C is a coenzyme for\nmultiple enzymes that take part in building the important connective tissue component, collagen. An important step in the\nbreakdown of glucose to yield energy is catalysis by a multi-enzyme complex called pyruvate dehydrogenase. Pyruvate\ndehydrogenase is a complex of several enzymes that actually requires one cofactor (a magnesium ion) and five different\norganic coenzymes to catalyze its specific chemical reaction. Therefore, enzyme function is, in part, regulated by an\nabundance of various cofactors and coenzymes, which are supplied primarily by the diets of most organisms.\nFigure 6.20 Vitamins are important coenzymes or precursors of coenzymes, and are required for enzymes to function\nproperly. Multivitamin capsules usually contain mixtures of all the vitamins at different percentages.\nEnzyme Compartmentalization\nIn eukaryotic cells, molecules such as enzymes are usually compartmentalized into different organelles. This allows for yet\nanother level of regulation of enzyme activity. Enzymes required only for certain cellular processes can be housed separately\nalong with their substrates, allowing for more efficient chemical reactions. Examples of this sort of enzyme regulation\nbased on location and proximity include the enzymes involved in the latter stages of cellular respiration, which take place\nexclusively in the mitochondria, and the enzymes involved in the digestion of cellular debris and foreign materials, located\nwithin lysosomes.\nFeedback Inhibition in Metabolic Pathways\nMolecules can regulate enzyme function in many ways. A major question remains, however: What are these molecules\nand where do they come from? Some are cofactors and coenzymes, ions, and organic molecules, as you\u2019ve learned. What\nother molecules in the cell provide enzymatic regulation, such as allosteric modulation, and competitive and noncompetitive\ninhibition? The answer is that a wide variety of molecules can perform these roles. Some of these molecules include\npharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical drugs, toxins, and poisons from the environment. Perhaps the most relevant sources\nof enzyme regulatory molecules, with respect to cellular metabolism, are the products of the cellular metabolic reactions\nthemselves. In a most efficient and elegant way, cells have evolved to use the products of their own reactions for feedback\ninhibition of enzyme activity. Feedback inhibition involves the use of a reaction product to regulate its own further\nproduction (Figure 6.21). The cell responds to the abundance of specific products by slowing down production during\nanabolic or catabolic reactions. Such reaction products may inhibit the enzymes that catalyzed their production through the\nmechanisms described above.\n266\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 6.21 Metabolic pathways are a series of reactions catalyzed by multiple enzymes. Feedback inhibition, where\nthe end product of the pathway inhibits an upstream step, is an important regulatory mechanism in cells.\nThe production of both amino acids and nucleotides is controlled through feedback inhibition. Additionally, ATP is an\nallosteric regulator of some of the enzymes involved in the catabolic breakdown of sugar, the process that produces ATP.\nIn this way, when ATP is abundant, the cell can prevent its further production. Remember that ATP is an unstable molecule\nthat can spontaneously dissociate into ADP. If too much ATP were present in a cell, much of it would go to waste. On the\nother hand, ADP serves as a positive allosteric regulator (an allosteric activator) for some of the same enzymes that are\ninhibited by ATP. Thus, when relative levels of ADP are high compared to ATP, the cell is triggered to produce more ATP\nthrough the catabolism of sugar.\nSection Summary\nEnzymes are chemical catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions at physiological temperatures by lowering their activation\nenergy. Enzymes are usually proteins consisting of one or more polypeptide chains. Enzymes have an active site that\nprovides a unique chemical environment, made up of certain amino acid R groups (residues). This unique environment\nis perfectly suited to convert particular chemical reactants for that enzyme, called substrates, into unstable intermediates\ncalled transition states. Enzymes and substrates are thought to bind with an induced fit, which means that enzymes undergo\nslight conformational adjustments upon substrate contact, leading to full, optimal binding. Enzymes bind to substrates and\ncatalyze reactions in four different ways: bringing substrates together in an optimal orientation, compromising the bond\nstructures of substrates so that bonds can be more easily broken, providing optimal environmental conditions for a reaction\nto occur, or participating directly in their chemical reaction by forming transient covalent bonds with the substrates.\nEnzyme action must be regulated so that in a given cell at a given time, the desired reactions are being catalyzed and\nthe undesired reactions are not. Enzymes are regulated by cellular conditions, such as temperature and pH. They are\nalso regulated through their location within a cell, sometimes being compartmentalized so that they can only catalyze\nreactions under certain circumstances. Inhibition and activation of enzymes via other molecules are other important ways\nthat enzymes are regulated. Inhibitors can act competitively, noncompetitively, or allosterically; noncompetitive inhibitors\nare usually allosteric. Activators can also enhance the function of enzymes allosterically. The most common method by\nwhich cells regulate the enzymes in metabolic pathways is through feedback inhibition. During feedback inhibition, the\nproducts of a metabolic pathway serve as inhibitors (usually allosteric) of one or more of the enzymes (usually the first\ncommitted enzyme of the pathway) involved in the pathway that produces them.\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\n267\nactivation energy\nactive site\nallosteric inhibition\nanabolic\nATP\nbioenergetics\ncatabolic\nchemical energy\ncoenzyme\ncofactor\ncompetitive inhibition\ndenature\nendergonic\nenthalpy\nentropy (S)\nexergonic\nfeedback inhibition\nfree energy\nheat\nheat energy\ninduced fit\nkinetic energy\nmetabolism\nphosphoanhydride bond\npotential energy\nsubstrate\nthermodynamics\ntransition state\nKEY TERMS\nenergy necessary for reactions to occur\nspecific region of the enzyme to which the substrate binds\ninhibition by a binding event at a site different from the active site, which induces a conformational\nchange and reduces the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate\n(also, anabolism) pathways that require an input of energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones\nadenosine triphosphate, the cell\u2019s energy currency\nstudy of energy flowing through living systems\n(also, catabolism) pathways in which complex molecules are broken down into simpler ones\npotential energy in chemical bonds that is released when those bonds are broken\nsmall organic molecule, such as a vitamin or its derivative, which is required to enhance the activity of an\nenzyme\ninorganic ion, such as iron and magnesium ions, required for optimal regulation of enzyme activity\ntype of inhibition in which the inhibitor competes with the substrate molecule by binding to the\nactive site of the enzyme\nprocess that changes the natural properties of a substance\ndescribes chemical reactions that require energy input\ntotal energy of a system\nmeasure of randomness or disorder within a system\ndescribes chemical reactions that release free energy\neffect of a product of a reaction sequence to decrease its further production by inhibiting the activity\nof the first enzyme in the pathway that produces it\nGibbs free energy is the usable energy, or energy that is available to do work.\nenergy energy transferred from one system to another that is not work (energy of the motion of molecules or particles)\ntotal bond energy of reactants or products in a chemical reaction\ndynamic fit between the enzyme and its substrate, in which both components modify their structures to allow\nfor ideal binding\ntype of energy associated with objects or particles in motion\nall the chemical reactions that take place inside cells, including anabolism and catabolism\nbond that connects phosphates in an ATP molecule\ntype of energy that has the potential to do work; stored energy\nmolecule on which the enzyme acts\nstudy of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter\nhigh-energy, unstable state (an intermediate form between the substrate and the product) occurring\nduring a chemical reaction\n268\nChapter 6 | Metabolism\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6",
        "summary": "Enzymes are biological catalysts, usually proteins, that speed up chemical reactions by lowering activation energy without altering the reaction\u2019s free energy. They have highly specific active sites whose unique chemical environments, created by amino acid side chains, enable temporary binding with substrates through an induced fit, optimizing conditions for the reaction. Enzymes facilitate reactions by orienting substrates, destabilizing bonds, providing optimal environments, or forming temporary covalent bonds, and remain unchanged after catalysis. Their activity is influenced by environmental factors like temperature and pH, as well as by cofactors (inorganic ions) and coenzymes (organic molecules, often vitamins). Cells regulate enzymes through competitive, noncompetitive, and allosteric inhibition or activation, compartmentalization within organelles, and feedback inhibition, where end products inhibit early steps in metabolic pathways to prevent overproduction. This regulation ensures that specific reactions proceed at appropriate rates to meet cellular needs."

Like a generating plant, plants and animals also must take in energy from\nthe environment and convert it into a form that their cells can use. Energy enters an organism\u2019s body in one form and is\nconverted into another form that can fuel the organism\u2019s life functions. In the process of photosynthesis, plants and other\nphotosynthetic producers take in energy in the form of light (solar energy) and convert it into chemical energy, glucose,\nwhich stores this energy in its chemical bonds. Then, a series of metabolic pathways, collectively called cellular respiration,\nextract the energy from the carbon\u2013carbon bonds of glucose and convert it into a form that all living things can use\u2014both\nproducers, such as plants, and consumers, such as animals.\nNearly all organisms perform glycolysis, the first part of both aerobic and anaerobic respiration. One of the key enzymes\nof glycolysis is pyruvate kinase. Without this enzyme, an organism will die because it is unable to convert nutrients into\nthe energy it needs for survival. Scientists have taken advantage of that fact by blocking pyruvate kinase in some deadly\nparasites, such as the ones that cause African Sleeping Sickness and Chagas disease.

ATP (adenosine triphosphate) functions as the energy currency for cells. It\nallows the cells to store energy and transfer it within the cells to provide energy for cellular processes such as growth,\nmovement and active transport. The ATP molecule consists of a ribose sugar and an adenine base with three phosphates\nattached. In the hydrolysis of ATP, free energy is supplied when a phosphate group or two are detached, and either ADP\n(adenosine diphosphate) or AMP (adenosine monophosphate) is produced. Energy derived from the metabolism of glucose\nis used to convert ADP to ATP during cellular respiration. As we explore cellular respiration, we\u2019ll learn that the two ways\nATP is regenerated by the cell are called substrate-level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined in\nBig Idea 2 and Big Idea 4 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework, as shown in the table.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 2.5][APLO 2.16]\nEnergy production within a cell involves many coordinated chemical pathways. Most of these pathways are combinations of\noxidation and reduction reactions. Oxidation and reduction occur in tandem. An oxidation reaction strips an electron from\nan atom in a compound, and the addition of this electron to another compound is a reduction reaction. Because oxidation\n282\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nand reduction usually occur together, these pairs of reactions are called oxidation reduction reactions, or redox reactions.\nElectrons and Energy\nThe removal of an electron from a molecule, oxidizing it, results in a decrease in potential energy in the oxidized compound.\nThe electron (sometimes as part of a hydrogen atom), does not remain unbonded, however, in the cytoplasm of a cell.\nRather, the electron is shifted to a second compound, reducing the second compound. The shift of an electron from one\ncompound to another removes some potential energy from the first compound (the oxidized compound) and increases the\npotential energy of the second compound (the reduced compound). The transfer of electrons between molecules is important\nbecause most of the energy stored in atoms and used to fuel cell functions is in the form of high-energy electrons. The\ntransfer of energy in the form of electrons allows the cell to transfer and use energy in an incremental fashion\u2014in small\npackages rather than in a single, destructive burst. This chapter focuses on the extraction of energy from food; you will see\nthat as you track the path of the transfers, you are tracking the path of electrons moving through metabolic pathways.\nElectron Carriers\nIn living systems, a small class of compounds functions as electron shuttles: They bind and carry high-energy electrons\nbetween compounds in pathways. The principal electron carriers we will consider are derived from the B vitamin group\nand are derivatives of nucleotides. These compounds can be easily reduced (that is, they accept electrons) or oxidized (they\nlose electrons). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) (Figure 7.2) is derived from vitamin B3, niacin. NAD+ is the\noxidized form of the molecule; NADH is the reduced form of the molecule after it has accepted two electrons and a proton\n(which together are the equivalent of a hydrogen atom with an extra electron).\nNAD+ can accept electrons from an organic molecule according to the general equation:\nRH\nReducing \nagent\n + \nNAD+\nOxidizing\nagent\n\u2192 NADH\nReduced +\nR\nOxidized\nWhen electrons are added to a compound, they are reduced. A compound that reduces another is called a reducing agent. In\nthe above equation, RH is a reducing agent, and NAD+ is reduced to NADH. When electrons are removed from compound,\nit is oxidized. A compound that oxidizes another is called an oxidizing agent. In the above equation, NAD+ is an oxidizing\nagent, and RH is oxidized to R.\nSimilarly, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD+) is derived from vitamin B2, also called riboflavin. Its reduced form is FADH2.\nA second variation of NAD, NADP, contains an extra phosphate group. Both NAD+ and FAD+ are extensively used in\nenergy extraction from sugars, and NADP plays an important role in anabolic reactions and photosynthesis.\nFigure 7.2 The oxidized form of the electron carrier (NAD+) is shown on the left and the reduced form (NADH) is shown\non the right. The nitrogenous base in NADH has one more hydrogen ion and two more electrons than in NAD+.\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\n283\nATP in Living Systems\nA living cell cannot store significant amounts of free energy. Excess free energy would result in an increase of heat in the\ncell, which would result in excessive thermal motion that could damage and then destroy the cell. Rather, a cell must be able\nto handle that energy in a way that enables the cell to store energy safely and release it for use only as needed. Living cells\naccomplish this by using the compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is often called the \u201cenergy currency\u201d of the cell,\nand, like currency, this versatile compound can be used to fill any energy need of the cell. How? It functions similarly to a\nrechargeable battery.\nWhen ATP is broken down, usually by the removal of its terminal phosphate group, energy is released. The energy is\nused to do work by the cell, usually by the released phosphate binding to another molecule, activating it. For example, in\nthe mechanical work of muscle contraction, ATP supplies the energy to move the contractile muscle proteins. Recall the\nactive transport work of the sodium-potassium pump in cell membranes. ATP alters the structure of the integral protein that\nfunctions as the pump, changing its affinity for sodium and potassium. In this way, the cell performs work, pumping ions\nagainst their electrochemical gradients.\nATP Structure and Function\nAt the heart of ATP is a molecule of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which is composed of an adenine molecule bonded\nto a ribose molecule and to a single phosphate group (Figure 7.3). The addition of a second phosphate group to this core\nmolecule results in the formation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP); the addition of a third phosphate group forms adenosine\ntriphosphate (ATP).\nFigure 7.3 ATP (adenosine triphosphate) has three phosphate groups that can be removed by hydrolysis to form ADP\n(adenosine diphosphate) or AMP (adenosine monophosphate).The negative charges on the phosphate group naturally\nrepel each other, requiring energy to bond them together and releasing energy when these bonds are broken.\nThe addition of a phosphate group to a molecule requires energy. Phosphate groups are negatively charged and thus repel\none another when they are arranged in series, as they are in ADP and ATP. This repulsion makes the ADP and ATP\nmolecules inherently unstable. The release of one or two phosphate groups from ATP, a process called dephosphorylation,\nreleases energy.\nEnergy from ATP\nHydrolysis is the process of breaking complex macromolecules apart. During hydrolysis, water is split, or lysed, and the\nresulting hydrogen atom (H+) and a hydroxyl group (OH-) are added to the larger molecule. The hydrolysis of ATP produces\nADP, together with an inorganic phosphate ion (Pi), and the release of free energy. To carry out life processes, ATP is\ncontinuously broken down into ADP, and like a rechargeable battery, ADP is continuously regenerated into ATP by the\nreattachment of a third phosphate group. Water, which was broken down into its hydrogen atom and hydroxyl group during\nATP hydrolysis, is regenerated when a third phosphate is added to the ADP molecule, reforming ATP.\nObviously, energy must be infused into the system to regenerate ATP. Where does this energy come from? In nearly every\nliving thing on earth, the energy comes from the metabolism of glucose. In this way, ATP is a direct link between the limited\nset of exergonic pathways of glucose catabolism and the multitude of endergonic pathways that power living cells.\nPhosphorylation\nRecall that, in some chemical reactions, enzymes may bind to several substrates that react with each other on the enzyme,\n284\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nforming an intermediate complex. An intermediate complex is a temporary structure, and it allows one of the substrates\n(such as ATP) and reactants to more readily react with each other; in reactions involving ATP, ATP is one of the substrates\nand ADP is a product. During an endergonic chemical reaction, ATP forms an intermediate complex with the substrate and\nenzyme in the reaction. This intermediate complex allows the ATP to transfer its third phosphate group, with its energy,\nto the substrate, a process called phosphorylation. Phosphorylation refers to the addition of the phosphate (~P). This is\nillustrated by the following generic reaction:\nA + enzyme + ATP \u2192 \n\u23a1\n\u23a3A \u2212 enzyme \u2212 \u223cP\n\u23a4\n\u23a6 \u2192 B + enzyme + ADP + phosphate ion\nWhen the intermediate complex breaks apart, the energy is used to modify the substrate and convert it into a product of the\nreaction. The ADP molecule and a free phosphate ion are released into the medium and are available for recycling through\ncell metabolism.\nSubstrate Phosphorylation\nATP is generated through two mechanisms during the breakdown of glucose. A few ATP molecules are generated (that\nis, regenerated from ADP) as a direct result of the chemical reactions that occur in the catabolic pathways. A phosphate\ngroup is removed from an intermediate reactant in the pathway, and the free energy of the reaction is used to add the third\nphosphate to an available ADP molecule, producing ATP (Figure 7.4). This very direct method of phosphorylation is called\nsubstrate-level phosphorylation.\nFigure 7.4 In phosphorylation reactions, the gamma phosphate of ATP is attached to a protein.\nOxidative Phosphorylation\nMost of the ATP generated during glucose catabolism, however, is derived from a much more complex process,\nchemiosmosis, which takes place in mitochondria (Figure 7.5) within a eukaryotic cell or the plasma membrane of a\nprokaryotic cell. Chemiosmosis, a process of ATP production in cellular metabolism, is used to generate 90 percent of the\nATP made during glucose catabolism and is also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to harness the\nenergy of sunlight. The production of ATP using the process of chemiosmosis is called oxidative phosphorylation because\nof the involvement of oxygen in the process.\nFigure 7.5 In eukaryotes, oxidative phosphorylation takes place in mitochondria. In prokaryotes, this process takes\nplace in the plasma membrane.

        "summary": "Energy in living systems involves capturing, storing, and using free energy to power essential life processes such as growth, reproduction, and active transport, with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) serving as the primary energy currency of the cell. Energy is transferred through oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions, in which high-energy electrons are moved between molecules via electron carriers like NAD\u207a/NADH and FAD/FADH\u2082. ATP stores energy in the bonds between its phosphate groups, and energy is released when these bonds are broken, typically by removing the terminal phosphate group. This released energy is used for cellular work, such as muscle contraction and active transport. ATP is regenerated from ADP primarily through substrate-level phosphorylation, where a phosphate group is transferred directly from a substrate to ADP, and oxidative phosphorylation, a more complex process involving chemiosmosis in mitochondria or prokaryotic plasma membranes. Oxidative phosphorylation accounts for most ATP production and requires oxygen. Together, these processes link the breakdown of glucose to the wide range of energy-requiring activities in living cells."

Glycolysis\nis the first step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cellular metabolism. Nearly all living organisms carry\nout glycolysis as part of their metabolism. The process does not use oxygen and is therefore anaerobic. Glycolysis takes\nplace in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Glucose enters heterotrophic cells in two ways. One method\nis through secondary active transport in which the transport takes place against the glucose concentration gradient. The\nother mechanism uses a group of integral proteins called GLUT proteins, also known as glucose transporter proteins. These\ntransporters assist in the facilitated diffusion of glucose.\nGlycolysis begins with the six carbon ring-shaped structure of a single glucose molecule and ends with two molecules of\na three-carbon sugar called pyruvate. Glycolysis consists of two distinct phases. The first part of the glycolysis pathway\ntraps the glucose molecule in the cell and uses energy to modify it so that the six-carbon sugar molecule can be split evenly\ninto the two three-carbon molecules. The second part of glycolysis extracts energy from the molecules and stores it in the\nform of ATP and NADH, the reduced form of NAD+.\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\n287\nFirst Half of Glycolysis (Energy-Requiring Steps)\nStep 1. The first step in glycolysis (Figure 7.6) is catalyzed by hexokinase, an enzyme with broad specificity that catalyzes\nthe phosphorylation of six-carbon sugars. Hexokinase phosphorylates glucose using ATP as the source of the phosphate,\nproducing glucose-6-phosphate, a more reactive form of glucose. This reaction prevents the phosphorylated glucose\nmolecule from continuing to interact with the GLUT proteins, and it can no longer leave the cell because the negatively\ncharged phosphate will not allow it to cross the hydrophobic interior of the plasma membrane.\nStep 2. In the second step of glycolysis, an isomerase converts glucose-6-phosphate into one of its isomers,\nfructose-6-phosphate. An isomerase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of a molecule into one of its isomers. (This\nchange from phosphoglucose to phosphofructose allows the eventual split of the sugar into two three-carbon molecules.).\nStep 3. The third step is the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate, catalyzed by the enzyme phosphofructokinase. A\nsecond ATP molecule donates a high-energy phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, producing fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. In\nthis pathway, phosphofructokinase is a rate-limiting enzyme. It is active when the concentration of ADP is high; it is less\nactive when ADP levels are low and the concentration of ATP is high. Thus, if there is \u201csufficient\u201d ATP in the system, the\npathway slows down. This is a type of end product inhibition, since ATP is the end product of glucose catabolism.\nStep 4. The newly added high-energy phosphates further destabilize fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The fourth step in glycolysis\nemploys an enzyme, aldolase, to cleave fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into two three-carbon isomers: dihydroxyacetone-\nphosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.\nStep\n5.\nIn\nthe\nfifth\nstep,\nan\nisomerase\ntransforms\nthe\ndihydroxyacetone-phosphate\ninto\nits\nisomer,\nglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Thus, the pathway will continue with two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. At this\npoint in the pathway, there is a net investment of energy from two ATP molecules in the breakdown of one glucose molecule.\nFigure 7.6 The first half of glycolysis uses two ATP molecules in the phosphorylation of glucose, which is then split\ninto two three-carbon molecules.\nSecond Half of Glycolysis (Energy-Releasing Steps)\nSo far, glycolysis has cost the cell two ATP molecules and produced two small, three-carbon sugar molecules. Both of these\nmolecules will proceed through the second half of the pathway, and sufficient energy will be extracted to pay back the two\nATP molecules used as an initial investment and produce a profit for the cell of two additional ATP molecules and two even\nhigher-energy NADH molecules.\nStep 6. The sixth step in glycolysis (Figure 7.7) oxidizes the sugar (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate), extracting high-energy\nelectrons, which are picked up by the electron carrier NAD+, producing NADH. The sugar is then phosphorylated by the\naddition of a second phosphate group, producing 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Note that the second phosphate group does not\nrequire another ATP molecule.\n288\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 7.7 The second half of glycolysis involves phosphorylation without ATP investment (step 6) and produces two\nNADH and four ATP molecules per glucose.\nHere again is a potential limiting factor for this pathway. The continuation of the reaction depends upon the availability of\nthe oxidized form of the electron carrier, NAD+. Thus, NADH must be continuously oxidized back into NAD+ in order to\nkeep this step going. If NAD+ is not available, the second half of glycolysis slows down or stops. If oxygen is available in\nthe system, the NADH will be oxidized readily, though indirectly, and the high-energy electrons from the hydrogen released\nin this process will be used to produce ATP. In an environment without oxygen, an alternate pathway (fermentation) can\nprovide the oxidation of NADH to NAD+.\nStep 7. In the seventh step, catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase (an enzyme named for the reverse reaction),\n1,3-bisphosphoglycerate donates a high-energy phosphate to ADP, forming one molecule of ATP. (This is an example of\nsubstrate-level phosphorylation.) A carbonyl group on the 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is oxidized to a carboxyl group, and\n3-phosphoglycerate is formed.\nStep 8. In the eighth step, the remaining phosphate group in 3-phosphoglycerate moves from the third carbon to the second\ncarbon, producing 2-phosphoglycerate (an isomer of 3-phosphoglycerate). The enzyme catalyzing this step is a mutase\n(isomerase).\nStep 9. Enolase catalyzes the ninth step. This enzyme causes 2-phosphoglycerate to lose water from its structure; this is\na dehydration reaction, resulting in the formation of a double bond that increases the potential energy in the remaining\nphosphate bond and produces phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP).\nStep 10. The last step in glycolysis is catalyzed by the enzyme pyruvate kinase (the enzyme in this case is named for the\nreverse reaction of pyruvate\u2019s conversion into PEP) and results in the production of a second ATP molecule by substrate-\nlevel phosphorylation and the compound pyruvic acid (or its salt form, pyruvate). Many enzymes in enzymatic pathways\nare named for the reverse reactions, since the enzyme can catalyze both forward and reverse reactions (these may have been\ndescribed initially by the reverse reaction that takes place in vitro, under non-physiological conditions).\nGain a better understanding of the breakdown of glucose by glycolysis by visiting this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/\nl/glycolysis) to see the process in action.\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\n289\nGlycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of nearly every cell. Organisms, from the small, circular colonies of\nbacteria pictured here to the human holding the petri dish, perform glycolysis using the same ten enzymes.\nBecause of this, it is thought that glycolysis must have evolved in the very earliest forms of life.\nFigure 7.8\nATP energy is needed for glycolysis.

The citric acid cycle (CAC or TCA- tricarboxylic acid cycle) is also known as the Krebs cycle. During the conversion\nof pyruvate into the acetyl group, a molecule of CO2 and two high-energy electrons are removed. (Remember that glycolysis\nproduces two molecules of pyruvate, and each can attach to a molecule of CoA and then enter the citric acid cycle.

The glucose molecule that originally entered cellular respiration in glycolysis has\nbeen completely oxidized. Chemical potential energy stored within the glucose molecules has been transferred to NADH or\nhas been used to synthesize ATP molecules.\nThe citric acid cycle occurs in the mitochondrial matrix and involves a series of redox and decarboxylation reactions that\nagain remove high energy electrons and produce CO2. These electrons are carried by NADH and FADH2 to the electron\ntransport chain located in the cristae of the mitochondrion. (You do not need to memorize the steps in the citric acid cycle,\nbut if provided with a diagram of the cycle, you should be able to interpret the steps.) During the cycle, ATP is synthesized\nfrom ADP and inorganic phosphate by substrate-level phosphorylation.\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\n291\n",
        "summary": "Glycolysis is an ancient, universal metabolic pathway that occurs in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and does not require oxygen.

The second, energy\u2011releasing phase, oxidizes these three\u2011carbon molecules to generate four ATP molecules (via substrate\u2011level phosphorylation) and two NADH molecules, yielding a net gain of two ATP and two NADH per glucose molecule. The process depends on the availability of NAD+ and key regulatory enzymes such as phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. If pyruvate is not further metabolized, glycolysis alone provides only these ATP molecules, as in red blood cells that rely solely on this pathway for energy."

(You do not need to memorize the steps in the citric acid cycle,\nbut if provided with a diagram of the cycle, you should be able to interpret the steps.)

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 2.1][APLO 2.5][APLO 2.16][APLO 2.17][APLO 2.18]\nIf oxygen is available, aerobic respiration will go forward. In eukaryotic cells, the pyruvate molecules produced at the end\nof glycolysis are transported into mitochondria. There, pyruvate will be transformed into an acetyl group that will be picked\nup and activated by a carrier compound called coenzyme A (CoA). The resulting compound is called acetyl CoA. CoA is\nmade from vitamin B5, pantothenic acid. Acetyl CoA can be used in a variety of ways by the cell, but its major function is\nto deliver the acetyl group derived from pyruvate to the next stage of the pathway in glucose catabolism.\nBreakdown of Pyruvate\nIn order for pyruvate, the product of glycolysis, to enter the next pathway, it must undergo several changes. The conversion\nis a three-step process (Figure 7.9).\nStep 1. A carboxyl group is removed from pyruvate, releasing a molecule of carbon dioxide into the surrounding medium.\nThe result of this step is a two-carbon hydroxyethyl group bound to the enzyme (pyruvate dehydrogenase). This is the first\nof the six carbons from the original glucose molecule to be removed. This step proceeds twice (remember: there are two\npyruvate molecules produced at the end of glycolsis) for every molecule of glucose metabolized; thus, two of the six carbons\nwill have been removed at the end of both steps.\n292\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nStep 2. The hydroxyethyl group is oxidized to an acetyl group, and the electrons are picked up by NAD+, forming NADH.\nThe high-energy electrons from NADH will be used later to generate ATP.\nStep 3. The enzyme-bound acetyl group is transferred to CoA, producing a molecule of acetyl CoA.\nFigure 7.9 Upon entering the mitochondrial matrix, a multi-enzyme complex converts pyruvate into acetyl CoA. In the\nprocess, carbon dioxide is released and one molecule of NADH is formed.\nNote that during the second stage of glucose metabolism, whenever a carbon atom is removed, it is bound to two oxygen\natoms, producing carbon dioxide, one of the major end products of cellular respiration.\nAcetyl CoA to CO2\nIn the presence of oxygen, acetyl CoA delivers its acetyl group to a four-carbon molecule, oxaloacetate, to form citrate,\na six-carbon molecule with three carboxyl groups; this pathway will harvest the remainder of the extractable energy from\nwhat began as a glucose molecule. This single pathway is called by different names: the citric acid cycle (for the first\nintermediate formed\u2014citric acid, or citrate\u2014when acetate joins to the oxaloacetate), the TCA cycle (since citric acid or\ncitrate and isocitrate are tricarboxylic acids), and the Krebs cycle, after Hans Krebs, who first identified the steps in the\npathway in the 1930s in pigeon flight muscles.\nCitric Acid Cycle\nLike the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, the citric acid cycle takes place in the matrix of mitochondria. Almost\nall of the enzymes of the citric acid cycle are soluble, with the single exception of the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase,\nwhich is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Unlike glycolysis, the citric acid cycle is a closed loop:\nThe last part of the pathway regenerates the compound used in the first step. The eight steps of the cycle are a series of\nredox, dehydration, hydration, and decarboxylation reactions that produce two carbon dioxide molecules, one GTP/ATP,\nand reduced forms of NADH and FADH2 (Figure 7.10). This is considered an aerobic pathway because the NADH and\nFADH2 produced must transfer their electrons to the next pathway in the system, which will use oxygen. If this transfer\ndoes not occur, the oxidation steps of the citric acid cycle also do not occur. Note that the citric acid cycle produces very\nlittle ATP directly and does not directly consume oxygen.\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\n293\nFigure 7.10 In the citric acid cycle, the acetyl group from acetyl CoA is attached to a four-carbon oxaloacetate molecule\nto form a six-carbon citrate molecule. Through a series of steps, citrate is oxidized, releasing two carbon dioxide\nmolecules for each acetyl group fed into the cycle. In the process, three NAD+ molecules are reduced to NADH, one\nFAD molecule is reduced to FADH2, and one ATP or GTP (depending on the cell type) is produced (by substrate-level\nphosphorylation). Because the final product of the citric acid cycle is also the first reactant, the cycle runs continuously\nin the presence of sufficient reactants. (credit: modification of work by \u201cYikrazuul\u201d/Wikimedia Commons)\nSteps in the Citric Acid Cycle\nStep 1. Prior to the start of the first step, a transitional phase occurs during which pyruvic acid is converted to acetyl CoA.\nThen, the first step of the cycle begins: This is a condensation step, combining the two-carbon acetyl group with a four-\ncarbon oxaloacetate molecule to form a six-carbon molecule of citrate. CoA is bound to a sulfhydryl group (-SH) and\ndiffuses away to eventually combine with another acetyl group. This step is irreversible because it is highly exergonic. The\nrate of this reaction is controlled by negative feedback and the amount of ATP available. If ATP levels increase, the rate of\nthis reaction decreases. If ATP is in short supply, the rate increases.\nStep 2. In step two, citrate loses one water molecule and gains another as citrate is converted into its isomer, isocitrate.\nStep 3. In step three, isocitrate is oxidized, producing a five-carbon molecule, \u03b1-ketoglutarate, together with a molecule of\nCO2 and two electrons, which reduce NAD+ to NADH. This step is also regulated by negative feedback from ATP and\nNADH, and a positive effect of ADP.\nSteps 3 and 4. Steps three and four are both oxidation and decarboxylation steps, which release electrons that reduce NAD+\nto NADH and release carboxyl groups that form CO2 molecules. \u03b1-Ketoglutarate is the product of step three, and a succinyl\ngroup is the product of step four. CoA binds the succinyl group to form succinyl CoA. The enzyme that catalyzes step four\n294\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nis regulated by feedback inhibition of ATP, succinyl CoA, and NADH.\nStep 5. In step five, a phosphate group is substituted for coenzyme A, and a high-energy bond is formed. This energy is\nused in substrate-level phosphorylation (during the conversion of the succinyl group to succinate) to form either guanine\ntriphosphate (GTP) or ATP. There are two forms of the enzyme, called isoenzymes, for this step, depending upon the type of\nanimal tissue in which they are found. One form is found in tissues that use large amounts of ATP, such as heart and skeletal\nmuscle. This form produces ATP. The second form of the enzyme is found in tissues that have a high number of anabolic\npathways, such as liver tissues. This form produces GTP. GTP is energetically equivalent to ATP; however, its use is more\nrestricted. In particular, protein synthesis primarily uses GTP.\nStep 6. Step six is a dehydration process that converts succinate into fumarate. Two hydrogen atoms are transferred to\nFAD, producing FADH2. The energy contained in the electrons of these atoms is insufficient to reduce NAD+ but adequate\nto reduce FAD. Unlike NADH, this carrier remains attached to the enzyme and transfers the electrons to the electron\ntransport chain directly. This process is made possible by the localization of the enzyme catalyzing this step inside the inner\nmembrane of the mitochondrion.\nStep 7. Water is added to fumarate during step seven, and malate is produced. The last step in the citric acid cycle\nregenerates oxaloacetate by oxidizing malate. Another molecule of NADH is produced in the process.\nClick through each step of the citric acid cycle here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/krebs_cycle) .\nWhy is the mitochondria considered the powerhouse of the cell?\na.\nGlycolysis takes place in mitochondria which extract energy by glucose breakdown for cellular metabolism.\nb.\nMost of the ATP is produced in mitochondria by oxidative phosphorylation.\nc.\nAll the pathways involved in ATP production take place in the mitochondria.\nd.\nThe outer membrane of mitochondria is loaded with proteins involved in electron transfer and ATP synthesis.\nProducts of the Citric Acid Cycle\nTwo carbon atoms come into the citric acid cycle from each acetyl group, representing four out of the six carbons of one\nglucose molecule. Two carbon dioxide molecules are released on each turn of the cycle; however, these do not necessarily\ncontain the most recently added carbon atoms. The two acetyl carbon atoms will eventually be released on later turns of the\ncycle; thus, all six carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are eventually incorporated into carbon dioxide. Each\nturn of the cycle forms three NADH molecules and one FADH2 molecule. These carriers will connect with the last portion\nof aerobic respiration to produce ATP molecules. One GTP or ATP is also made in each cycle. Several of the intermediate\ncompounds in the citric acid cycle can be used in synthesizing non-essential amino acids; therefore, the cycle is amphibolic\n(both catabolic and anabolic).\nThink About It\nExplain how citrate from the citric acid cycle might affect glycolysis. What other factors might affect the efficiency of\nthe citric acid cycle and its products?\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\n295\n7.4 | Oxidative Phosphorylation\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow do electrons move through the electron transport chain and what happens to their energy levels?\n\u2022\nHow is a proton (H+) gradient established and maintained by the electron transport chain and how many ATP\nmolecules are produced by chemiosmosis?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe electron transport chain (ETC) is the stage of aerobic respiration that uses free oxygen as the final electron acceptor of\nthe electrons removed during glucose metabolism in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.

        "summary": "In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate from glycolysis is transported into the mitochondria, where it undergoes a three-step conversion to acetyl CoA: removal of a carboxyl group as CO\u2082, oxidation of the remaining group to form NADH, and transfer of the acetyl group to coenzyme A. Acetyl CoA then enters the citric acid cycle (Krebs or TCA cycle) in the mitochondrial matrix, where it combines with oxaloacetate to form citrate and proceeds through a closed loop of eight steps involving oxidation, decarboxylation, dehydration, and hydration reactions. Each turn of the cycle releases two CO\u2082 molecules, produces three NADH, one FADH\u2082, and one ATP (or GTP) via substrate-level phosphorylation, while regenerating oxaloacetate to sustain the cycle. These reduced electron carriers feed into the electron transport chain for further ATP production, and several intermediates serve as precursors for anabolic pathways, making the cycle amphibolic."

Most of the ATP generated during the aerobic catabolism of glucose, however, is not generated directly from these\n296\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\npathways. Rather, it is derived from a process that begins with moving electrons through a series of electron transporters\nthat undergo redox reactions. This causes hydrogen ions to accumulate within the matrix space. Therefore, a concentration\ngradient forms in which hydrogen ions diffuse out of the matrix space by passing through ATP synthase. The current of\nhydrogen ions powers the catalytic action of ATP synthase, which phosphorylates ADP, producing ATP.\nElectron Transport Chain\nThe electron transport chain (Figure 7.11) is the last component of aerobic respiration and is the only part of glucose\nmetabolism that uses atmospheric oxygen. Oxygen continuously diffuses into plants; in animals, it enters the body through\nthe respiratory system. Electron transport is a series of redox reactions that resemble a relay race or bucket brigade in\nthat electrons are passed rapidly from one component to the next, to the endpoint of the chain where the electrons reduce\nmolecular oxygen, producing water. There are four complexes composed of proteins, labeled I through IV in Figure 7.11,\nand the aggregation of these four complexes, together with associated mobile, accessory electron carriers, is called the\nelectron transport chain. The electron transport chain is present in multiple copies in the inner mitochondrial membrane of\neukaryotes and the plasma membrane of prokaryotes.\nFigure 7.11 The electron transport chain is a series of electron transporters embedded in the inner mitochondrial\nmembrane that shuttles electrons from NADH and FADH2 to molecular oxygen. In the process, protons are pumped\nfrom the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, and oxygen is reduced to form water.\nComplex I\nTo start, two electrons are carried to the first complex aboard NADH. This complex, labeled I, is composed of flavin\nmononucleotide (FMN) and an iron-sulfur (Fe-S)-containing protein. FMN, which is derived from vitamin B2, also called\nriboflavin, is one of several prosthetic groups or co-factors in the electron transport chain. A prosthetic group is a non-\nprotein molecule required for the activity of a protein. Prosthetic groups are organic or inorganic, non-peptide molecules\nbound to a protein that facilitate its function; prosthetic groups include co-enzymes, which are the prosthetic groups of\nenzymes. The enzyme in complex I is NADH dehydrogenase and is a very large protein, containing 45 amino acid chains.\nComplex I can pump four hydrogen ions across the membrane from the matrix into the intermembrane space, and it is in\nthis way that the hydrogen ion gradient is established and maintained between the two compartments separated by the inner\nmitochondrial membrane.\nQ and Complex II\nComplex II directly receives FADH2, which does not pass through complex I. The compound connecting the first and\nsecond complexes to the third is ubiquinone (Q). The Q molecule is lipid soluble and freely moves through the hydrophobic\ncore of the membrane. Once it is reduced, (QH2), ubiquinone delivers its electrons to the next complex in the electron\ntransport chain. Q receives the electrons derived from NADH from complex I, and the electrons derived from FADH2 from\ncomplex II. This enzyme and FADH2 form a small complex that delivers electrons directly to the electron transport chain,\nbypassing the first complex. Since these electrons bypass and thus do not energize the proton pump in the first complex,\nfewer ATP molecules are made from the FADH2 electrons. The number of ATP molecules ultimately obtained is directly\nproportional to the number of protons pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane.\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\n297\nComplex III\nThe third complex is composed of cytochrome b, another Fe-S protein, Rieske center (2Fe-2S center), and cytochrome c\nproteins; this complex is also called cytochrome oxidoreductase. Cytochrome proteins have a prosthetic group of heme.\nThe heme molecule is similar to the heme in hemoglobin, but it carries electrons, not oxygen. As a result, the iron ion at\nits core is reduced and oxidized as it passes the electrons, fluctuating between different oxidation states: Fe++ (reduced)\nand Fe+++ (oxidized). The heme molecules in the cytochromes have slightly different characteristics due to the effects of\nthe different proteins binding them, giving slightly different characteristics to each complex. Complex III pumps protons\nthrough the membrane and passes its electrons to cytochrome c for transport to the fourth complex of proteins and enzymes\n(cytochrome c is the acceptor of electrons from Q; however, whereas Q carries pairs of electrons, cytochrome c can accept\nonly one at a time).\nComplex IV\nThe fourth complex is composed of cytochrome proteins c, a, and a3. This complex contains two heme groups (one in each\nof the two cytochromes, a, and a3) and three copper ions (a pair of CuA and one CuB in cytochrome a3). The cytochromes\nhold an oxygen molecule very tightly between the iron and copper ions until the oxygen is completely reduced. The reduced\noxygen then picks up two hydrogen ions from the surrounding medium to make water (H2O). The removal of the hydrogen\nions from the system contributes to the ion gradient used in the process of chemiosmosis.\nChemiosmosis\nIn chemiosmosis, the free energy from the series of redox reactions just described is used to pump hydrogen ions (protons)\nacross the membrane. The uneven distribution of H+ ions across the membrane establishes both concentration and electrical\ngradients (thus, an electrochemical gradient), owing to the hydrogen ions\u2019 positive charge and their aggregation on one side\nof the membrane.\nIf the membrane were open to diffusion by the hydrogen ions, the ions would tend to diffuse back across into the matrix,\ndriven by their electrochemical gradient. Recall that many ions cannot diffuse through the nonpolar regions of phospholipid\nmembranes without the aid of ion channels. Similarly, hydrogen ions in the matrix space can only pass through the inner\nmitochondrial membrane through an integral membrane protein called ATP synthase (Figure 7.12). This complex protein\nacts as a tiny generator, turned by the force of the hydrogen ions diffusing through it, down their electrochemical gradient.\nThe turning of parts of this molecular machine facilitates the addition of a phosphate to ADP, forming ATP, using the\npotential energy of the hydrogen ion gradient.\n298\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 7.12 ATP synthase is a complex, molecular machine that uses a proton (H+) gradient to form ATP from\nADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). (Credit: modification of work by Klaus Hoffmeier)\nDinitrophenol (DNP) is an uncoupler that makes the inner mitochondrial membrane leak protons (H+ ) . It was used\nuntil 1938 as a weight-loss drug.

Recall that the production of ATP using the process of chemiosmosis in mitochondria is called\noxidative phosphorylation. The overall result of these reactions is the production of ATP from the energy of the electrons\nremoved from hydrogen atoms. These atoms were originally part of a glucose molecule. At the end of the pathway, the\nelectrons are used to reduce an oxygen molecule to oxygen ions. The extra electrons on the oxygen attract hydrogen ions\n(protons) from the surrounding medium, and water is formed.\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\n299\nFigure 7.13 In oxidative phosphorylation, the pH gradient formed by the electron transport chain is used by ATP\nsynthase to form ATP.\nCyanide inhibits cytochrome c oxidase, a component of the electron transport chain.

For example, the number of hydrogen\nions that the electron transport chain complexes can pump through the membrane varies between species. Another source\nof variance stems from the shuttle of electrons across the membranes of the mitochondria. (The NADH generated from\nglycolysis cannot easily enter mitochondria.) Thus, electrons are picked up on the inside of mitochondria by either NAD+\nor FAD+. As you have learned earlier, these FAD+ molecules can transport fewer ions; consequently, fewer ATP molecules\nare generated when FAD+ acts as a carrier. NAD+ is used as the electron transporter in the liver and FAD+ acts in the brain.\nAnother factor that affects the yield of ATP molecules generated from glucose is the fact that intermediate compounds in\nthese pathways are used for other purposes. Glucose catabolism connects with the pathways that build or break down all\nother biochemical compounds in cells, and the result is somewhat messier than the ideal situations described thus far. For\nexample, sugars other than glucose are fed into the glycolytic pathway for energy extraction. Moreover, the five-carbon\nsugars that form nucleic acids are made from intermediates in glycolysis. Certain nonessential amino acids can be made\nfrom intermediates of both glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. Lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides, are also made\nfrom intermediates in these pathways, and both amino acids and triglycerides are broken down for energy through these\npathways. Overall, in living systems, these pathways of glucose catabolism extract about 34 percent of the energy contained\nin glucose.\n300\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nActivity\nUse construction paper and other art materials to create your own diagram of the electron transport chain\n(ETC).

If oxygen is not\npresent, ATP is only produced by substrate-level phosphorylation. Without oxygen, organisms must use another electron\nacceptor. Most organisms will use some form of fermentation to accomplish the regeneration of NAD+ to ensure the\ncontinuation of glycolysis. In alcohol fermentation, pyruvate from glycolysis is converted to ethyl alcohol; during lactic\nacid fermentation, pyruvate is reduced to form lactate as an end-product.

        "summary": "Oxidative phosphorylation is the final stage of aerobic respiration, in which electrons from NADH and FADH\u2082 are transferred through a series of protein complexes (I-IV) and mobile carriers in the inner mitochondrial membrane, ultimately reducing oxygen to water. As electrons pass through the chain via redox reactions, free energy is used at specific points to pump protons (H\u207a) from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient. This proton motive force drives chemiosmosis, where protons flow back into the matrix through ATP synthase, powering the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. Complex I receives electrons from NADH and pumps protons, while Complex II delivers electrons from FADH\u2082 without proton pumping; both feed electrons to ubiquinone (Q), which delivers them to Complex III, which pumps more protons and passes electrons to cytochrome c. Complex IV transfers electrons to oxygen, forming water and contributing further to the gradient. Chemiosmosis produces about 90% of the ATP generated in aerobic respiration, with the total ATP yield (typically 36\u201338 per glucose) varying by species, cell type, and pathway interactions."

If oxygen is not\npresent, ATP is only produced by substrate-level phosphorylation. Without oxygen, organisms must use another electron\nacceptor. Most organisms will use some form of fermentation to accomplish the regeneration of NAD+ to ensure the\ncontinuation of glycolysis. In alcohol fermentation, pyruvate from glycolysis is converted to ethyl alcohol; during lactic\nacid fermentation, pyruvate is reduced to form lactate as an end-product. Without fermentation and anaerobic respiration,\nwe wouldn\u2019t have yogurt or soy sauce.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 2.21][APLO 2.24][APLO 4.14][APLO 4.26]\nIn aerobic respiration, the final electron acceptor is an oxygen molecule, O2. If aerobic respiration occurs, then ATP will be\nproduced using the energy of high-energy electrons carried by NADH or FADH2 to the electron transport chain. If aerobic\nrespiration does not occur, NADH must be reoxidized to NAD+ for reuse as an electron carrier for the glycolytic pathway to\ncontinue. How is this done? Some living systems use an organic molecule as the final electron acceptor. Processes that use\nan organic molecule to regenerate NAD+ from NADH are collectively referred to as fermentation. In contrast, some living\nsystems use an inorganic molecule as a final electron acceptor. Both methods are called anaerobic cellular respiration in\nwhich organisms convert energy for their use in the absence of oxygen.\nAnaerobic Cellular Respiration\nCertain prokaryotes, including some species of bacteria and Archaea, use anaerobic respiration. For example, the group of\nArchaea called methanogens reduces carbon dioxide to methane to oxidize NADH. These microorganisms are found in soil\nand in the digestive tracts of ruminants, such as cows and sheep. Similarly, sulfate-reducing bacteria and Archaea, most of\nwhich are anaerobic ( Figure 7.14), reduce sulfate to hydrogen sulfide to regenerate NAD+ from NADH.\n302\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 7.14 The green color seen in these coastal waters is from an eruption of hydrogen sulfide-producing bacteria.\nThese anaerobic, sulfate-reducing bacteria release hydrogen sulfide gas as they decompose algae in the water.\n(credit: modification of work by NASA/Jeff Schmaltz, MODIS Land Rapid Response Team at NASA GSFC, Visible\nEarth Catalog of NASA images)\nVisit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/fermentation) to see anaerobic cellular respiration in action.\nHow does the formation of NAD+\ndiffer between aerobic and anaerobic respiration?\na.\nNAD+\nis formed in aerobic respiration by a fermentation process and formed in anaerobic respiration by\noxidation of NADH .\nb.\nNAD+ is formed by a fermentation process in anaerobic conditions by the conversion of pyruvate into\nlactate and by simple oxidation of NADH in aerobic respiration.\nc.\nUnder aerobic conditions, the electron acceptor is a molecule other than oxygen for NAD+\nproduction,\nwhereas under anaerobic conditions the electron acceptor is oxygen.\nd.\nNAD+\nis formed by a fermentation process in anaerobic conditions whereas in aerobic respiration it is\nformed by the breakdown of pyruvate into lactic acid or alcohol.\nLactic Acid Fermentation\nThe fermentation method used by animals and certain bacteria, like those in yogurt, is lactic acid fermentation (Figure\n7.15). This type of fermentation is used routinely in mammalian red blood cells and in skeletal muscle that has an\ninsufficient oxygen supply to allow aerobic respiration to continue (that is, in muscles used to the point of fatigue). In\nmuscles, lactic acid accumulation must be removed by the blood circulation and the lactate brought to the liver for further\nmetabolism. The chemical reactions of lactic acid fermentation are the following:\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\n303\nPyruvic acid + NADH \u2194lactic acid + NAD+\nThe enzyme used in this reaction is lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The reaction can proceed in either direction, but the\nreaction from left to right is inhibited by acidic conditions. Such lactic acid accumulation was once believed to cause\nmuscle stiffness, fatigue, and soreness, although more recent research disputes this hypothesis. Once the lactic acid has been\nremoved from the muscle and circulated to the liver, it can be reconverted into pyruvic acid and further catabolized for\nenergy.\n304\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 7.15 Lactic acid fermentation is common in muscle cells that have run out of oxygen.\nTremetol, a metabolic poison found in the white snake root plant, prevents the metabolism of lactate.

Symptoms of this disease, which include vomiting, abdominal pain, and tremors, become worse after\nexercise. Why do you think this is the case?\nTremetol, a metabolic poison found in the white snake root plant, prevents the metabolism of lactate. When cows eat\nthis plant, it is concentrated in the milk they produce. Humans who consume the milk become ill. Symptoms of this\ndisease, which include vomiting, abdominal pain, and tremors, become worse after exercise. Why do you think this is\nthe case?\na.\nTremetol inhibits enzymes that convert lactate into less harmful compounds. Exercise worsens this by\nproducing more lactate.\nb.\nTremetol increases the production of lactate dehydrogenase, causing lactic acid to accumulate in the body.\nc.\nTremetol inhibits the production of NAD+ after exercise. The lack of oxygen causes lactic acid to accumulate\nin the body.\nd.\nTremetol binds to lactic acid, inhibiting its breakdown into other compounds and causing it to accumulate\nafter exercising.\nAlcohol Fermentation\nAnother familiar fermentation process is alcohol fermentation (Figure 7.16) that produces ethanol, an alcohol. The first\nchemical reaction of alcohol fermentation is the following (CO2 does not participate in the second reaction):\npyruvic acid + H+ \u2192CO2 + acetaldehyde + NADH + H+ \u2192ethanol + NAD+\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\n305\nThe first reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate decarboxylase, a cytoplasmic enzyme, with a coenzyme of thiamine\npyrophosphate (TPP, derived from vitamin B1 and also called thiamine). A carboxyl group is removed from pyruvic\nacid, releasing carbon dioxide as a gas. The loss of carbon dioxide reduces the size of the molecule by one carbon,\nmaking acetaldehyde. The second reaction is catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase to oxidize NADH to NAD+ and reduce\nacetaldehyde to ethanol. The fermentation of pyruvic acid by yeast produces the ethanol. Ethanol tolerance of yeast is\nvariable, ranging from about 5 percent to 21 percent, depending on the yeast strain and environmental conditions.\nFigure 7.16 Fermentation of grape juice produces CO2 as a byproduct. Fermentation tanks have valves so that the\npressure inside the tanks created by the carbon dioxide produced can be released.\nOther Types of Fermentation\nOther fermentation methods occur in bacteria. Many prokaryotes are facultatively anaerobic. This means that they can\nswitch between aerobic respiration and fermentation, depending on the availability of oxygen. Certain prokaryotes, like\nClostridia, are obligate anaerobes. Obligate anaerobes live and grow in the absence of molecular oxygen. Oxygen is a\npoison to these microorganisms and kills them on exposure. It should be noted that all forms of fermentation, except lactic\nacid fermentation, produce gas. The production of particular types of gas is used as an indicator of the fermentation of\nspecific carbohydrates, which plays a role in the laboratory identification of the bacteria. Various methods of fermentation\nare used by assorted organisms to ensure an adequate supply of NAD+ for the sixth step in glycolysis. Without these\npathways, that step would not occur and no ATP would be harvested from the breakdown of glucose.\nLab Investigation\nLab Investigation: Respiration of Sugars by Yeast. You are given the opportunity to design and conduct\nexperiments to investigate whether yeasts are able to metabolize a variety of sugars, using gas pressure\nsensors or other means to measure CO2 production.\nThink About It\nTremetol, a metabolic poison found in the white snake plant root, prevents the metabolism of lactate. When female\ncows eat this plant, tremetol becomes concentrated in their milk. Humans who consume the milk become ill.

        "summary": "Metabolism without oxygen occurs when cells must generate energy in the absence of oxygen, relying on substrate-level phosphorylation for ATP production and alternative methods to regenerate NAD+ from NADH so glycolysis can continue. In anaerobic cellular respiration, some prokaryotes use inorganic molecules, such as carbon dioxide or sulfate, as final electron acceptors, producing methane or hydrogen sulfide, respectively. Fermentation, which uses organic molecules as electron acceptors, is another common strategy. In lactic acid fermentation, used by animals and certain bacteria, pyruvate is reduced to lactate, allowing NAD+ regeneration; this process occurs in fatigued muscles and in red blood cells. Alcohol fermentation, carried out by yeast, converts pyruvate into acetaldehyde (releasing CO2) and then reduces it to ethanol while oxidizing NADH to NAD+. Other fermentation types occur in bacteria, with some species being facultative anaerobes and others obligate anaerobes, and most (except lactic acid fermentation) produce gases useful in identifying microbial species. All these processes ensure a supply of NAD+ for glycolysis, which is essential for ATP production in the absence of oxygen."

The catabolism of both fructose\nand galactose produces the same number of ATP molecules as glucose.\nConnections of Proteins to Glucose Metabolism\nProteins are hydrolyzed by a variety of enzymes in cells. Most of the time, the amino acids are recycled into the synthesis\nof new proteins. If there are excess amino acids, however, or if the body is in a state of starvation, some amino acids will be\nshunted into the pathways of glucose catabolism (Figure 7.17). Each amino acid must have its amino group removed prior\nto entry into these pathways. The amino group is converted into ammonia. In mammals, the liver synthesizes urea from two\nammonia molecules and a carbon dioxide molecule. Thus, urea is the principal waste product in mammals, produced from\nthe nitrogen originating in amino acids, and it leaves the body in urine.\nFigure 7.17 The carbon skeletons of certain amino acids (indicated in boxes) derived from proteins can feed into the\ncitric acid cycle. (credit: modification of work by Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m)\nConnections of Lipid and Glucose Metabolisms\nThe lipids that are connected to the glucose pathways are cholesterol and triglycerides. Cholesterol is a lipid that contributes\nto cell membrane flexibility and is a precursor of steroid hormones. The synthesis of cholesterol starts with acetyl groups\nand proceeds in only one direction. The process cannot be reversed.\nTriglycerides are a form of long-term energy storage in animals. Triglycerides are made of glycerol and three fatty acids.\nAnimals can make most of the fatty acids they need. Triglycerides can be both made and broken down through parts of the\nglucose catabolism pathways. Glycerol can be phosphorylated to glycerol-3-phosphate, which continues through glycolysis.\nFatty acids are catabolized in a process called beta-oxidation that takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria and converts\ntheir fatty acid chains into two carbon units of acetyl groups. The acetyl groups are picked up by CoA to form acetyl CoA\nthat proceeds into the citric acid cycle.\n308\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 7.18 Glycogen from the liver and muscles, hydrolyzed into glucose-1-phosphate, together with fats and\nproteins, can feed into the catabolic pathways for carbohydrates.\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\n309\nPathways of Photosynthesis and Cellular Metabolism\nThe processes of photosynthesis and cellular metabolism consist of several very complex pathways. It is\ngenerally thought that the first cells arose in an aqueous environment\u2014a \u201csoup\u201d of nutrients\u2014probably on\nthe surface of some porous clays. If these cells reproduced successfully and their numbers climbed steadily,\nit follows that the cells would begin to deplete the nutrients from the medium in which they lived as they\nshifted the nutrients into the components of their own bodies. This hypothetical situation would have resulted\nin natural selection favoring those organisms that could exist by using the nutrients that remained in their\nenvironment and by manipulating these nutrients into materials upon which they could survive. Selection\nwould favor those organisms that could extract maximal value from the nutrients to which they had access.\nAn early form of photosynthesis developed that harnessed the sun\u2019s energy using water as a source\nof hydrogen atoms, but this pathway did not produce free oxygen (anoxygenic photosynthesis). (Early\nphotosynthesis did not produce free oxygen because it did not use water as the source of hydrogen\nions; instead, it used materials like hydrogen sulfide and consequently produced sulfur). It is thought that\nglycolysis developed at this time and could take advantage of the simple sugars being produced, but these\nreactions were unable to fully extract the energy stored in the carbohydrates. The development of glycolysis\nprobably predated the evolution of photosynthesis, as it was well suited to extract energy from materials\nspontaneously accumulating in the \u201cprimeval soup.\u201d A later form of photosynthesis used water as a source\nof electrons and hydrogen, and generated free oxygen. Over time, the atmosphere became oxygenated,\nbut not before the oxygen released oxidized metals in the ocean and created a \u201crust\u201d layer in the sediment,\npermitting the dating of the rise of the first oxygenic photosynthesizers. Living things adapted to exploit\nthis new atmosphere that allowed aerobic respiration as we know it to evolve. When the full process of\noxygenic photosynthesis developed and the atmosphere became oxygenated, cells were finally able to use\nthe oxygen expelled by photosynthesis to extract considerably more energy from the sugar molecules using\nthe citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.\nAccording to the Evolution Connection passage, in what order did the metabolic pathways evolve?\na.\n1.\nanoxygenic photosynthesis\n2.\nglycolysis\n3.\noxygenic photosynthesis\n4.\ncitric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation\nb.\n1.\nglycolysis\n2.\ncitric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation\n3.\nanoxygenic photosynthesis\n4.\noxygenic photosynthesis\nc.\n1.\nanoxygenic photosynthesis\n2.\noxygenic photosynthesis\n3.\nglycolysis\n4.\ncitric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation\nd.\n1.\nglycolysis\n2.\nanoxygenic photosynthesis\n3.\noxygenic photosynthesis\n4.\ncitric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation\n310\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nThink About It\nExplain how free energy can be obtained from the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and even nucleic\nacids.

        "summary": "Carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolic pathways are interconnected through glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, with each macromolecule entering these pathways at different points to provide free energy. Carbohydrates, such as glycogen, can be stored in the liver and muscle and later broken down into glucose-1-phosphate, which is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and enters glycolysis; other sugars like fructose and galactose are also metabolized to yield similar ATP amounts. Proteins are broken down into amino acids, which, after deamination and conversion of the amino group into urea for excretion, can feed their carbon skeletons into intermediates of the citric acid cycle. Lipids, including cholesterol and triglycerides, are linked to these pathways as well; cholesterol is synthesized from acetyl groups, while triglycerides can be broken into glycerol (entering glycolysis) and fatty acids, which undergo beta-oxidation to produce acetyl CoA for the citric acid cycle. These interconnections make metabolic pathways porous, allowing intermediates to move between pathways for flexibility in energy production."

The cell also must\ngenerate a number of intermediate compounds that are used in the anabolism and catabolism of macromolecules. Without\ncontrols, metabolic reactions would quickly come to a stand-still as the forward and backward reactions reached a state of\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\n311\nequilibrium. Resources would be used inappropriately. A cell does not need the maximum amount of ATP that it can make\nall the time: At times, the cell needs to shunt some of the intermediates to pathways for amino acid, protein, glycogen, lipid,\nand nucleic acid production. In short, the cell needs to control its metabolism.\nRegulatory Mechanisms\nA variety of mechanisms is used to control cellular respiration. Some type of control exists at each stage of glucose\nmetabolism. Access of glucose to the cell can be regulated using the GLUT proteins that transport glucose (Figure 7.19).\nDifferent forms of the GLUT protein control passage of glucose into the cells of specific tissues.\nFigure 7.19 GLUT4 is a glucose transporter that is stored in vesicles. A cascade of events that occurs upon insulin\nbinding to a receptor in the plasma membrane causes GLUT4-containing vesicles to fuse with the plasma membrane\nso that glucose may be transported into the cell.\nSome reactions are controlled by having two different enzymes\u2014one each for the two directions of a reversible reaction.\nReactions that are catalyzed by only one enzyme can go to equilibrium, stalling the reaction. In contrast, if two different\nenzymes (each specific for a given direction) are necessary for a reversible reaction, the opportunity to control the rate of\nthe reaction increases, and equilibrium is not reached.\nA number of enzymes involved in each of the pathways\u2014in particular, the enzyme catalyzing the first committed reaction\nof the pathway\u2014are controlled by attachment of a molecule to an allosteric site on the protein. The molecules most\ncommonly used in this capacity are the nucleotides ATP, ADP, AMP, NAD+, and NADH. These regulators, allosteric\neffectors, may increase or decrease enzyme activity, depending on the prevailing conditions. The allosteric effector alters\nthe steric structure of the enzyme, usually affecting the configuration of the active site. This alteration of the protein\u2019s (the\nenzyme\u2019s) structure either increases or decreases its affinity for its substrate, with the effect of increasing or decreasing the\nrate of the reaction. The attachment signals to the enzyme. This binding can increase or decrease the enzyme\u2019s activity,\nproviding feedback. This feedback type of control is effective as long as the chemical affecting it is attached to the enzyme.\nOnce the overall concentration of the chemical decreases, it will diffuse away from the protein, and the control is relaxed.\nControl of Catabolic Pathways\nEnzymes, proteins, electron carriers, and pumps that play roles in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport\nchain tend to catalyze non-reversible reactions. In other words, if the initial reaction takes place, the pathway is committed\nto proceeding with the remaining reactions. Whether a particular enzyme activity is released depends upon the energy needs\nof the cell (as reflected by the levels of ATP, ADP, and AMP).\nGlycolysis\nThe control of glycolysis begins with the first enzyme in the pathway, hexokinase (Figure 7.20). This enzyme catalyzes\nthe phosphorylation of glucose, which helps to prepare the compound for cleavage in a later step. The presence of the\nnegatively charged phosphate in the molecule also prevents the sugar from leaving the cell. When hexokinase is inhibited,\nglucose diffuses out of the cell and does not become a substrate for the respiration pathways in that tissue. The product of\nthe hexokinase reaction is glucose-6-phosphate, which accumulates when a later enzyme, phosphofructokinase, is inhibited.\n312\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 7.20 The glycolysis pathway is primarily regulated at the three key enzymatic steps (1, 2, and 7) as indicated.\nNote that the first two steps that are regulated occur early in the pathway and involve hydrolysis of ATP.\nPhosphofructokinase is the main enzyme controlled in glycolysis. High levels of ATP, citrate, or a lower, more acidic pH\ndecrease the enzyme\u2019s activity. An increase in citrate concentration can occur because of a blockage in the citric acid cycle.\nFermentation, with its production of organic acids like lactic acid, frequently accounts for the increased acidity in a cell;\nhowever, the products of fermentation do not typically accumulate in cells.\nThe last step in glycolysis is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase. The pyruvate produced can proceed to be catabolized or\nconverted into the amino acid alanine. If no more energy is needed and alanine is in adequate supply, the enzyme\nis inhibited. The enzyme\u2019s activity is increased when fructose-1,6-bisphosphate levels increase. (Recall that\nfructose-1,6-bisphosphate is an intermediate in the first half of glycolysis.) The regulation of pyruvate kinase involves\nphosphorylation by a kinase (pyruvate kinase kinase), resulting in a less-active enzyme. Dephosphorylation by a\nphosphatase reactivates it. Pyruvate kinase is also regulated by ATP (a negative allosteric effect).\nIf more energy is needed, more pyruvate will be converted into acetyl CoA through the action of pyruvate dehydrogenase. If\neither acetyl groups or NADH accumulate, there is less need for the reaction and the rate decreases. Pyruvate dehydrogenase\nis also regulated by phosphorylation: A kinase phosphorylates it to form an inactive enzyme, and a phosphatase reactivates\nit. The kinase and the phosphatase are also regulated.\nCitric Acid Cycle\nThe citric acid cycle is controlled through the enzymes that catalyze the reactions that make the first two molecules of\nNADH (Figure 7.10). These enzymes are isocitrate dehydrogenase and \u03b1\u2011ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. When adequate\nATP and NADH levels are available, the rates of these reactions decrease. When more ATP is needed, as reflected in\nrising ADP levels, the rate increases. \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase will also be affected by the levels of succinyl CoA\u2014a\nsubsequent intermediate in the cycle\u2014causing a decrease in activity. A decrease in the rate of operation of the pathway at\nthis point is not necessarily negative, as the increased levels of the \u03b1-ketoglutarate not used by the citric acid cycle can be\nused by the cell for amino acid (glutamate) synthesis.\nElectron Transport Chain\nSpecific enzymes of the electron transport chain are unaffected by feedback inhibition, but the rate of electron transport\nthrough the pathway is affected by the levels of ADP and ATP. Greater ATP consumption by a cell is indicated by a buildup\nof ADP. As ATP usage decreases, the concentration of ADP decreases, and now, ATP begins to build up in the cell. This\nchange in the relative concentration of ADP to ATP triggers the cell to slow down the electron transport chain.\nChapter 7 | Cellular Respiration\n313\nVisit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/electron_transp) to see an animation of the electron transport chain and ATP\nsynthesis.\nWhich statement best describes the formation and importance of the hydrogen ion gradient during the electron transport\nchain?\na.\nA hydrogen ion gradient across the membrane establishes a concentration gradient and not an electrical\ngradient, thus assisting during the electron transport chain.\nb.\nA hydrogen ion gradient is established by pumping two hydrogen ions across the membrane from the matrix\nin the intermembrane space.

        "summary": "Cellular respiration is regulated to balance ATP production with the cell\u2019s energy demands and to ensure intermediates are available for anabolic pathways. Control occurs at multiple stages, beginning with glucose entry via GLUT transport proteins, and primarily through negative feedback mechanisms involving key enzymes that respond to ATP, ADP, AMP, NAD+, and NADH levels. Many reactions are regulated by allosteric effectors that alter enzyme activity, often at the first committed step of a pathway. In glycolysis, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase are tightly regulated by products, energy charge, pH, and intermediates such as fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Pyruvate dehydrogenase, which converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA, is inhibited by high levels of acetyl CoA or NADH and activated by ADP and pyruvate, with phosphorylation controlling its activity. The citric acid cycle is regulated mainly at isocitrate dehydrogenase and \u03b1\u2011ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, which are inhibited by ATP, NADH, or succinyl CoA and activated by ADP or calcium ions. While enzymes in the electron transport chain are not directly feedback inhibited, its rate is modulated by relative ADP and ATP levels\u2014rising ADP accelerates the chain, while high ATP slows it."

To get this energy, many organisms access stored energy by eating, that is, by\ningesting other organisms. But where does the stored energy in food originate? Almost all of this energy can be traced back\nto photosynthesis.\nPhotosynthetic organisms are the basis for almost all of the food webs on the planet. For example, the Indian River Lagoon,\na 156 mile mixture of fresh and salt water along the eastern coast of Florida, depends on its sea grass for the survival of\nits marine life. Unfortunately, when certain algal phytoplankton species grow in overabundance, it destroys the sea grass.\nScientists conducted a 16 year study of algal blooms and found that extreme climate conditions, such as cold weather and\nlow rainfall, change which particular species of phytoplankton is more likely to bloom, resulting in a die-off of sea grass,\ndecrease in other marine life, and changes in salinity. The research study can be found here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/\n32algae) .\nChapter 8 | Photosynthesis\n329\n8.1 | Overview of Photosynthesis\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat is the relevance of photosynthesis to living organisms?\n\u2022\nWhat are the main cellular structures involved in photosynthesis?\n\u2022\nWhat are the substrates and products of photosynthesis?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nAs we learned in Chapter 7, all living organisms, from simple bacteria to complex plants and animals, require free\nenergy to carry out cellular processes, such as growth and reproduction. Organisms use various strategies to capture,\nstore, transform, and transfer free energy, including photosynthesis. Photosynthesis allows organisms to access enormous\namounts of free energy from the sun and transform it to the chemical energy of sugars. Although all organisms carry out\nsome form of cellular respiration, only certain organisms, called photoautotrophs, can perform photosynthesis. Examples\nof photoautotrophs include plants, algae, some unicellular eukaryotes, and cyanobacteria. They require the presence of\nchlorophyll, a specialized pigment that absorbs certain wavelengths of the visible light spectrum to harness free energy\nfrom the sun. Photosynthesis is a process where components of water and carbon dioxide are used to assemble carbohydrate\nmolecules and where oxygen waste products are released into the atmosphere. In eukaryotes, the reactions of photosynthesis\noccur in chloroplasts; in prokaryotes, such as cyanobacteria, the reactions are less localized and occur within membranes\nand in the cytoplasm. (The structural features of the chloroplast that participate in photosynthesis will be explored in more\ndetail later in The Light-Dependent Reactions of Photosynthesis and Using Light Energy to Make Organic Molecules.)\nAlthough photosynthesis and cellular respiration evolved as independent processes\u2014with photosynthesis creating an\noxidizing atmosphere early in Earth\u2019s history\u2014today they are interdependent. As we studied in Cellular Respiration, aerobic\ncellular respiration taps into the oxidizing ability of oxygen to synthesize the organic compounds that are used to power\ncellular processes.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and learning objectives outlined in Big\nIdea 1 and Big Idea 2 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework, as shown in the table.

It is the only biological process that can\ncapture energy that originates in outer space (sunlight) and convert it into chemical compounds (carbohydrates) that every\norganism uses to power its metabolism. In brief, the energy of sunlight is captured and used to energize electrons, whose\nenergy is then stored in the covalent bonds of sugar molecules. How long lasting and stable are those covalent bonds? The\nenergy extracted today by the burning of coal and petroleum products represents sunlight energy captured and stored by\nphotosynthesis almost 200 million years ago.\nPlants, algae, and a group of bacteria called cyanobacteria are the only organisms capable of performing photosynthesis\n(Figure 8.2). Because they use light to manufacture their own food, they are called photoautotrophs (literally, \u201cself-feeders\nusing light\u201d). Other organisms, such as animals, fungi, and most other bacteria, are termed heterotrophs (\u201cother feeders\u201d),\nbecause they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs. A third very interesting\ngroup of bacteria synthesize sugars, not by using sunlight\u2019s energy, but by extracting energy from inorganic chemical\ncompounds; hence, they are referred to as chemoautotrophs.\nChapter 8 | Photosynthesis\n331\nFigure 8.2 Photoautotrophs including (a) plants, (b) algae, and (c) cyanobacteria synthesize their organic compounds\nvia photosynthesis using sunlight as an energy source. Cyanobacteria and planktonic algae can grow over enormous\nareas in water, at times completely covering the surface. In a (d) deep sea vent, chemoautotrophs, such as these\n(e) thermophilic bacteria, capture energy from inorganic compounds to produce organic compounds. The ecosystem\nsurrounding the vents has a diverse array of animals, such as tubeworms, crustaceans, and octopi that derive\nenergy from the bacteria.

A lizard sunning itself on a cold day can\nuse the sun\u2019s energy to warm up. Photosynthesis is vital because it evolved as a way to store the energy in solar radiation (the\n\u201cphoto-\u201d part) as energy in the carbon-carbon bonds of carbohydrate molecules (the \u201c-synthesis\u201d part). Those carbohydrates\nare the energy source that heterotrophs use to power the synthesis of ATP via respiration. Therefore, photosynthesis powers\n99 percent of Earth\u2019s ecosystems. When a top predator, such as a wolf, preys on a deer (Figure 8.3), the wolf is at the end of\nan energy path that went from nuclear reactions on the surface of the sun, to light, to photosynthesis, to vegetation, to deer,\nand finally to wolf.\nFigure 8.3 The energy stored in carbohydrate molecules from photosynthesis passes through the food chain. The\npredator that eats these deer receives a portion of the energy that originated in the photosynthetic vegetation that the\ndeer consumed.

What evidence supports the claim that\nphotosynthesis and cellular respiration are interdependent processes?\nMain Structures and Summary of Photosynthesis\nPhotosynthesis is a multi-step process that requires sunlight, carbon dioxide (which is low in energy), and water as\nsubstrates (Figure 8.4). After the process is complete, it releases oxygen and produces glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA3P),\nsimple carbohydrate molecules (which are high in energy) that can subsequently be converted into glucose, sucrose, or any\nof dozens of other sugar molecules. These sugar molecules contain energy and the energized carbon that all living things\nneed to survive.\nFigure 8.4 Photosynthesis uses solar energy, carbon dioxide, and water to produce energy-storing carbohydrates.\nOxygen is generated as a waste product of photosynthesis.\nThe following is the chemical equation for photosynthesis (Figure 8.5):\nFigure 8.5 The basic equation for photosynthesis is deceptively simple. In reality, the process takes place in many\nsteps involving intermediate reactants and products. Glucose, the primary energy source in cells, is made from two\nthree-carbon GA3Ps.\nAlthough the equation looks simple, the many steps that take place during photosynthesis are actually quite complex. Before\nChapter 8 | Photosynthesis\n333\nlearning the details of how photoautotrophs turn sunlight into food, it is important to become familiar with the structures\ninvolved.\nIn plants, photosynthesis generally takes place in leaves, which consist of several layers of cells. The process of\nphotosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the mesophyll. The gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs\nthrough small, regulated openings called stomata (singular: stoma), which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange\nand water balance. The stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf, which helps to minimize water loss. Each\nstoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response to\nosmotic changes.\nIn all autotrophic eukaryotes, photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a chloroplast. For plants, chloroplast-\ncontaining cells exist in the mesophyll. Chloroplasts have a double membrane envelope (composed of an outer membrane\nand an inner membrane). Within the chloroplast are stacked, disc-shaped structures called thylakoids. Embedded in the\nthylakoid membrane is chlorophyll, a pigment (molecule that absorbs light) responsible for the initial interaction between\nlight and plant material, and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain. The thylakoid membrane encloses\nan internal space called the thylakoid lumen. As shown in Figure 8.6, a stack of thylakoids is called a granum, and the\nliquid-filled space surrounding the granum is called stroma or \u201cbed\u201d (not to be confused with stoma or \u201cmouth,\u201d an opening\non the leaf epidermis).\nFigure 8.6 Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts, which have an outer membrane and an inner membrane.\nStacks of thylakoids called grana form a third membrane layer.\nOn a hot, dry day, plants close their stomata to conserve water. What impact will this have on photosynthesis?\na.\nRate of photosynthesis will be inhibited as the level of carbon dioxide decreases.\nb.\nRate of photosynthesis will be inhibited as the level of oxygen decreases.\nc.\nThe rate of photosynthesis will increase as the level of carbon dioxide increases.\nd.\nRate of photosynthesis will increase as the level of oxygen increases.\nThe Two Parts of Photosynthesis\nPhotosynthesis takes place in two sequential stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light independent-reactions. In\nthe light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored\nchemical energy. In the light-independent reactions, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions\ndrives the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. Therefore, although the light-independent reactions do not use\nlight as a reactant, they require the products of the light-dependent reactions to function. In addition, several enzymes of\nthe light-independent reactions are activated by light. The light-dependent reactions utilize certain molecules to temporarily\nstore the energy: These are referred to as energy carriers. The energy carriers that move energy from light-dependent\nreactions to light-independent reactions can be thought of as \u201cfull\u201d because they are rich in energy. After the energy is\n334\nChapter 8 | Photosynthesis\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nreleased, the \u201cempty\u201d energy carriers return to the light-dependent reaction to obtain more energy. Figure 8.7 illustrates the\ncomponents inside the chloroplast where the light-dependent and light-independent reactions take place.\nFigure 8.7 Photosynthesis takes place in two stages: light dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. Light-dependent\nreactions, which take place in the thylakoid membrane, use light energy to make ATP and NADPH. The Calvin cycle,\nwhich takes place in the stroma, uses energy derived from these compounds to make GA3P from CO2.\nClick the link (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/photosynthesis) to learn more about photosynthesis.\nExplain how the light reactions and light independent reactions (Calvin cycle) of photosynthesis are interdependent on\neach other.\na.\nThe light reactions produces ATP and NADPH, which are then used in the Calvin cycle.\nb.\nThe light reactions produces NADP+ and ADP, which are then used in the Calvin cycle.\nc.\nThe light reactions uses NADPH and ATP, which are produced by the Calvin cycle.\nd.\nThe light reactions produce only NADPH, which is produced by the Calvin cycle.\nChapter 8 | Photosynthesis\n335\nPhotosynthesis at the Grocery Store\nFigure 8.8 Foods that humans consume originate from photosynthesis. (credit: Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de\nSupermercados)\nMajor grocery stores in the United States are organized into departments, such as dairy, meats, produce,\nbread, cereals, and so forth. Each aisle (Figure 8.8) contains hundreds, if not thousands, of different\nproducts for customers to buy and consume.\nAlthough there is a large variety, each item links back to photosynthesis. Meats and dairy link, because the\nanimals were fed plant-based foods. The breads, cereals, and pastas come largely from starchy grains,\nwhich are the seeds of photosynthesis-dependent plants. What about desserts and drinks? All of these\nproducts contain sugar\u2014sucrose is a plant product, a disaccharide, a carbohydrate molecule, which is built\ndirectly from photosynthesis. Moreover, many items are less obviously derived from plants: For instance,\npaper goods are generally plant products, and many plastics (abundant as products and packaging) are\nderived from algae. Virtually every spice and flavoring in the spice aisle was produced by a plant as a leaf,\nroot, bark, flower, fruit, or stem.

        "summary": "Photosynthesis is the process by which photoautotrophs\u2014plants, algae, some unicellular eukaryotes, and cyanobacteria\u2014capture energy from sunlight using chlorophyll and convert water and carbon dioxide into energy-rich carbohydrate molecules, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. It is vital to life on Earth because it is the primary means of converting solar energy into chemical energy, which powers nearly all ecosystems and supports both autotrophs and heterotrophs. In plants, photosynthesis typically occurs in the mesophyll cells of leaves, where gas exchange happens through stomata and the reactions take place in chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain thylakoids, which house chlorophyll in their membranes, organized into stacks called grana, surrounded by the stroma. Photosynthesis occurs in two stages: light-dependent reactions, which capture solar energy in ATP and NADPH, and light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle), which use this stored energy to synthesize glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA3P) from carbon dioxide. The process underpins the entire food web, as all food sources\u2014directly or indirectly\u2014derive from photosynthetic production."

Each aisle (Figure 8.8) contains hundreds, if not thousands, of different\nproducts for customers to buy and consume.\nAlthough there is a large variety, each item links back to photosynthesis. Meats and dairy link, because the\nanimals were fed plant-based foods. The breads, cereals, and pastas come largely from starchy grains,\nwhich are the seeds of photosynthesis-dependent plants. What about desserts and drinks? All of these\nproducts contain sugar\u2014sucrose is a plant product, a disaccharide, a carbohydrate molecule, which is built\ndirectly from photosynthesis.

What wavelengths are used in\nphotosynthesis?\n\u2022\nHow and where does photosynthesis occur within a plant?\n336\nChapter 8 | Photosynthesis\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nPhotosynthesis consists of two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions or Calvin cycle.\nThe light-dependent reactions occur when light is available. The overall equation for photosynthesis shows that is it a redox\nreaction; carbon dioxide is reduced and water is oxidized to produce oxygen:\nEnergy\u2009+\u20096CO2 \u2009+\u2009H2 O\u2009 \u2192\u2009C6 H12 O6 \u2009+\u20096O2\nThe light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, whereas the Calvin cycle occurs in the\nstroma of chloroplasts. Embedded in the thylakoid membranes are two photosystems (PS I and PS II), which are complexes\nof pigments that capture solar energy. Chlorophylls a and b absorb violet, blue, and red wavelengths from the visible\nlight spectrum and reflect green. The carotenoid pigments absorb violet-blue-green light and reflect yellow-to-orange\nlight. Environmental factors such as day length and temperature influence which pigments predominant at certain times\nof the year. Although the two photosystems run simultaneously, it is easier to explore them separately. Let\u2019s begin with\nphotosystem II.\nA photon of light strikes the antenna pigments of PS II to initiate photosynthesis. In the noncyclic pathway, PS II captures\nphotons at a slightly higher energy level than PS I. (Remember that shorter wavelengths of light carry more energy.) The\nabsorbed energy travels to the reaction center of the antenna pigment that contains chlorophyll a and boosts chlorophyll a\nelectrons to a higher energy level. The electrons are accepted by a primary electron acceptor protein and then pass to the\nelectron transport chain also embedded in the thylakoid membrane. The energy absorbed in PS II is enough to oxidize (split)\nwater, releasing oxygen into the atmosphere; the electrons released from the oxidation of water replace the electrons that\nwere boosted from the reaction center chlorophyll. As the electrons from the reaction center chlorophyll pass through the\nseries of electron carrier proteins, hydrogen ions (H+) are pumped across the membrane via chemiosmosis into the interior\nof the thylakoid. (If this sounds familiar, it should. We studied chemiosmosis in our exploration of cellular respiration\nin Cellular Respiration.) This action builds up a high concentration of H+ ions, and as they flow through ATP synthase,\nmolecules of ATP are formed. These molecules of ATP will be used to provide free energy for the synthesis of carbohydrate\nin the Calvin cycle, the second stage of photosynthesis. The electron transport chain connects PS II and PS I. Similar to the\nevents occurring in PS II, this second photosystem absorbs a second photon of light, resulting in the formation of a molecule\nof NADPH from NADP+. The energy carried in NADPH also is used to power the chemical reactions of the Calvin cycle.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and learning objectives outlined\nin Big Idea 2 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework, as shown in the table.

When a person turns on a lamp, electrical energy becomes light energy. Like all\nother forms of kinetic energy, light can travel, change form, and be harnessed to do work. In the case of photosynthesis,\nlight energy is converted into chemical energy, which photoautotrophs use to build carbohydrate molecules (Figure 8.9).\nHowever, autotrophs only use a few specific components of sunlight.\n338\nChapter 8 | Photosynthesis\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 8.9 Photoautotrophs can capture light energy from the sun, converting it into the chemical energy used to build\nfood molecules. (credit: Gerry Atwell)\nWhat Is Light Energy?\nThe sun emits an enormous amount of electromagnetic radiation (solar energy). Humans can see only a fraction of this\nenergy, which portion is therefore referred to as \u201cvisible light.\u201d The manner in which solar energy travels is described\nas waves. Scientists can determine the amount of energy of a wave by measuring its wavelength, the distance between\nconsecutive points of a wave. A single wave is measured from two consecutive points, such as from crest to crest or from\ntrough to trough (Figure 8.10).\nFigure 8.10 The wavelength of a single wave is the distance between two consecutive points of similar position (two\ncrests or two troughs) along the wave.\nVisible light constitutes only one of many types of electromagnetic radiation emitted from the sun and other stars. Scientists\ndifferentiate the various types of radiant energy from the sun within the electromagnetic spectrum. The electromagnetic\nspectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of radiation (Figure 8.11). The difference between wavelengths relates to\nthe amount of energy carried by them.\nChapter 8 | Photosynthesis\n339\nFigure 8.11 The sun emits energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. This radiation exists at different\nwavelengths, each of which has its own characteristic energy. All electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, is\ncharacterized by its wavelength.\nEach type of electromagnetic radiation travels at a particular wavelength. The longer the wavelength (or the more stretched\nout it appears in the diagram), the less energy is carried. Short, tight waves carry the most energy. This may seem illogical,\nbut think of it in terms of a piece of moving a heavy rope. It takes little effort by a person to move a rope in long, wide\nwaves. To make a rope move in short, tight waves, a person would need to apply significantly more energy.\nThe electromagnetic spectrum (Figure 8.11) shows several types of electromagnetic radiation originating from the sun,\nincluding X-rays and ultraviolet (UV) rays. The higher-energy waves can penetrate tissues and damage cells and DNA,\nexplaining why both X-rays and UV rays can be harmful to living organisms.\nAbsorption of Light\nLight energy initiates the process of photosynthesis when pigments absorb the light. Organic pigments, whether in the\nhuman retina or the chloroplast thylakoid, have a narrow range of energy levels that they can absorb. Energy levels lower\nthan those represented by red light are insufficient to raise an orbital electron to a populatable, excited (quantum) state.\nEnergy levels higher than those in blue light will physically tear the molecules apart, called bleaching. So retinal pigments\ncan only \u201csee\u201d (absorb) 700 nm to 400 nm light, which is therefore called visible light. For the same reasons, plants pigment\nmolecules absorb only light in the wavelength range of 700 nm to 400 nm; plant physiologists refer to this range for plants\nas photosynthetically active radiation.\nThe visible light seen by humans as white light actually exists in a rainbow of colors. Certain objects, such as a prism or\na drop of water, disperse white light to reveal the colors to the human eye. The visible light portion of the electromagnetic\nspectrum shows the rainbow of colors, with violet and blue having shorter wavelengths, and therefore higher energy. At the\nother end of the spectrum toward red, the wavelengths are longer and have lower energy (Figure 8.12).\n340\nChapter 8 | Photosynthesis\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 8.12 The colors of visible light do not carry the same amount of energy. Violet has the shortest wavelength and\ntherefore carries the most energy, whereas red has the longest wavelength and carries the least amount of energy.\n(credit: modification of work by NASA)\nUnderstanding Pigments\nDifferent kinds of pigments exist, and each absorbs only certain wavelengths (colors) of visible light. Pigments reflect or\ntransmit the wavelengths they cannot absorb, making them appear in the corresponding color.\nChlorophylls and carotenoids are the two major classes of photosynthetic pigments found in plants and algae; each class\nhas multiple types of pigment molecules. There are five major chlorophylls: a, b, c and d and a related molecule found in\nprokaryotes called bacteriochlorophyll. Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are found in higher plant chloroplasts and will be\nthe focus of the following discussion.\nWith dozens of different forms, carotenoids are a much larger group of pigments. The carotenoids found in fruit\u2014such as\nthe red of tomato (lycopene), the yellow of corn seeds (zeaxanthin), or the orange of an orange peel (\u03b2-carotene)\u2014are used\nas advertisements to attract seed dispersers. In photosynthesis, carotenoids function as photosynthetic pigments that are\nvery efficient molecules for the disposal of excess energy. When a leaf is exposed to full sun, the light-dependent reactions\nare required to process an enormous amount of energy; if that energy is not handled properly, it can do significant damage.\nTherefore, many carotenoids reside in the thylakoid membrane, absorb excess energy, and safely dissipate that energy as\nheat.\nEach type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light, which is the\nabsorption spectrum. The graph in Figure 8.13 shows the absorption spectra for chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and a type\nof carotenoid pigment called \u03b2-carotene (which absorbs blue and green light). Notice how each pigment has a distinct set\nof peaks and troughs, revealing a highly specific pattern of absorption. Chlorophyll a absorbs wavelengths from either end\nof the visible spectrum (blue and red), but not green. Because green is reflected or transmitted, chlorophyll appears green.\nCarotenoids absorb in the short-wavelength blue region, and reflect the longer yellow, red, and orange wavelengths.\nChapter 8 | Photosynthesis\n341\nFigure 8.13 (a) Chlorophyll a, (b) chlorophyll b, and (c) \u03b2-carotene are hydrophobic organic pigments found in\nthe thylakoid membrane. Chlorophyll a and b, which are identical except for the part indicated in the red box, are\nresponsible for the green color of leaves. \u03b2-carotene is responsible for the orange color in carrots. Each pigment has\n(d) a unique absorbance spectrum.\nMany photosynthetic organisms have a mixture of pigments; using them, the organism can absorb energy from a wider\nrange of wavelengths. Not all photosynthetic organisms have full access to sunlight. Some organisms grow underwater\nwhere light intensity and quality decrease and change with depth. Other organisms grow in competition for light. Plants on\nthe rainforest floor must be able to absorb any bit of light that comes through, because the taller trees absorb most of the\nsunlight and scatter the remaining solar radiation (Figure 8.14).\nFigure 8.14 Plants that commonly grow in the shade have adapted to low levels of light by changing the relative\nconcentrations of their chlorophyll pigments. (credit: Jason Hollinger)\nWhen studying a photosynthetic organism, scientists can determine the types of pigments present by generating absorption\nspectra. An instrument called a spectrophotometer can differentiate which wavelengths of light a substance can absorb.\nSpectrophotometers measure transmitted light and compute from it the absorption. By extracting pigments from leaves\nand placing these samples into a spectrophotometer, scientists can identify which wavelengths of light an organism can\nabsorb. Additional methods for the identification of plant pigments include various types of chromatography that separate\nthe pigments by their relative affinities to solid and mobile phases.\n342\nChapter 8 | Photosynthesis\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nHow Light-Dependent Reactions Work\nThe overall function of light-dependent reactions is to convert solar energy into chemical energy in the form of NADPH\nand ATP. This chemical energy supports the light-independent reactions and fuels the assembly of sugar molecules. The\nlight-dependent reactions are depicted in Figure 8.15. Protein complexes and pigment molecules work together to produce\nNADPH and ATP.\nFigure 8.15 A photosystem consists of a light-harvesting complex and a reaction center. Pigments in the light-\nharvesting complex pass light energy to two special chlorophyll a molecules in the reaction center. The light excites\nan electron from the chlorophyll a pair, which passes to the primary electron acceptor. The excited electron must then\nbe replaced. In (a) photosystem II, the electron comes from the splitting of water, which releases oxygen as a waste\nproduct. In (b) photosystem I, the electron comes from the chloroplast electron transport chain discussed below.\nThe actual step that converts light energy into chemical energy takes place in a multiprotein complex called a photosystem,\ntwo types of which are found embedded in the thylakoid membrane, photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI)\n(Figure 8.16). The two complexes differ on the basis of what they oxidize (that is, the source of the low-energy electron\nsupply) and what they reduce (the place to which they deliver their energized electrons).\nBoth photosystems have the same basic structure; a number of antenna proteins to which the chlorophyll molecules are\nbound surround the reaction center where the photochemistry takes place. Each photosystem is serviced by the light-\nharvesting complex, which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center; it consists of multiple antenna proteins that\ncontain a mixture of 300\u2013400 chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids. The absorption of\na single photon or distinct quantity or \u201cpacket\u201d of light by any of the chlorophylls pushes that molecule into an excited\nstate. In short, the light energy has now been captured by biological molecules but is not stored in any useful form yet. The\nenergy is transferred from chlorophyll to chlorophyll until eventually (after about a millionth of a second), it is delivered to\nthe reaction center. Up to this point, only energy has been transferred between molecules, not electrons.\nChapter 8 | Photosynthesis\n343\nFigure 8.16 In the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center, energy from sunlight is used to extract electrons from\nwater. The electrons travel through the chloroplast electron transport chain to photosystem I (PSI), which reduces\nNADP+ to NADPH. The electron transport chain moves protons across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. At\nthe same time, splitting of water adds protons to the lumen, and reduction of NADPH removes protons from the\nstroma. The net result is a low pH in the thylakoid lumen, and a high pH in the stroma. ATP synthase uses this\nelectrochemical gradient to make ATP.\nWhat is the external source of the electrons that ultimately pass through photosynthetic electron transport chains?\na.\ncarbon dioxide\nb.\nNADPH\nc.\noxygen\nd.\nwater\nThe reaction center contains a pair of chlorophyll a molecules with a special property. Those two chlorophylls can undergo\noxidation upon excitation; they can actually give up an electron in a process called a photoact. It is at this step in the reaction\ncenter, this step in photosynthesis, that light energy is converted into an excited electron. All of the subsequent steps involve\ngetting that electron onto the energy carrier NADPH for delivery to the Calvin cycle where the electron is deposited onto\ncarbon for long-term storage in the form of a carbohydrate.PSII and PSI are two major components of the photosynthetic\nelectron transport chain, which also includes the cytochrome complex. The cytochrome complex, an enzyme composed\nof two protein complexes, transfers the electrons from the carrier molecule plastoquinone (Pq) to the protein plastocyanin\n(Pc), thus enabling both the transfer of protons across the thylakoid membrane and the transfer of electrons from PSII to\nPSI.\nThe reaction center of PSII (called P680) delivers its high-energy electrons, one at the time, to the primary electron\nacceptor, and through the electron transport chain (Pq to cytochrome complex to plastocyanine) to PSI. P680\u2019s missing\nelectron is replaced by extracting a low-energy electron from water; thus, water is split and PSII is re-reduced after every\nphotoact. Splitting one H2O molecule releases two electrons, two hydrogen atoms, and one atom of oxygen. Splitting two\nmolecules is required to form one molecule of diatomic O2 gas. About 10 percent of the oxygen is used by mitochondria\nin the leaf to support oxidative phosphorylation. The remainder escapes to the atmosphere where it is used by aerobic\norganisms to support respiration.\n344\nChapter 8 | Photosynthesis\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nAs electrons move through the proteins that reside between PSII and PSI, they lose energy. That energy is used to move\nhydrogen atoms from the stromal side of the membrane to the thylakoid lumen. Those hydrogen atoms, plus the ones\nproduced by splitting water, accumulate in the thylakoid lumen and will be used to synthesize ATP in a later step. Because\nthe electrons have lost energy prior to their arrival at PSI, they must be re-energized by PSI, hence, another photon is\nabsorbed by the PSI antenna. That energy is relayed to the PSI reaction center (called P700). P700 is oxidized and sends a\nhigh-energy electron to NADP+ to form NADPH. Thus, PSII captures the energy to create proton gradients to make ATP,\nand PSI captures the energy to reduce NADP+ into NADPH. The two photosystems work in concert, in part, to guarantee\nthat the production of NADPH will roughly equal the production of ATP. Other mechanisms exist to fine tune that ratio to\nexactly match the chloroplast\u2019s constantly changing energy needs.\nGenerating an Energy Carrier: ATP\nAs in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria during cellular respiration, the buildup of hydrogen ions inside the\nthylakoid lumen creates a concentration gradient. The passive diffusion of hydrogen ions from high concentration (in the\nthylakoid lumen) to low concentration (in the stroma) is harnessed to create ATP, just as in the electron transport chain of\ncellular respiration. The ions build up energy because of diffusion and because they all have the same electrical charge,\nrepelling each other.\nTo release this energy, hydrogen ions will rush through any opening, similar to water jetting through a hole in a dam. In the\nthylakoid, that opening is a passage through a specialized protein channel called the ATP synthase. The energy released by\nthe hydrogen ion stream allows ATP synthase to attach a third phosphate group to ADP, which forms a molecule of ATP\n(Figure 8.16). The flow of hydrogen ions through ATP synthase is called chemiosmosis because the ions move from an\narea of high to an area of low concentration through a semi-permeable structure.\nVisit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/light_reactions) and click through the animation to view the process of\nphotosynthesis within a leaf.\nWhat role do electrons play in the formation of NADPH?\na.\nElectrons from PS I cause the reduction of NADPH to NADP+ .\nb.\nElectrons from PSII cause the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH.\nc.\nElectrons from PS I cause the reduction of NADP+\nto NADPH.\nd.\nElectrons are gained which causes the oxidation of NADP+ .\nChapter 8 | Photosynthesis\n345\nFigure 8.17 The anatomy of a leaf.

        "summary": "The light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, where pigments such as chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids absorb light in the 700\u2013400 nm range (photosynthetically active radiation) to capture solar energy. These reactions use two photosystems, PSII and PSI, each composed of a light-harvesting complex and a reaction center, to convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH. In PSII, absorbed photons excite electrons that are replaced by those obtained from splitting water, releasing oxygen and contributing protons to the thylakoid lumen. Electrons move through an electron transport chain, creating a proton gradient used by ATP synthase to produce ATP through chemiosmosis. Electrons arriving at PSI are re-energized by another photon and used to reduce NADP+ to NADPH. Together, PSII mainly generates the proton gradient for ATP synthesis while PSI primarily produces NADPH, with both energy carriers used in the Calvin cycle to build carbohydrates. Pigment diversity allows organisms to absorb light across a broad range of wavelengths, and carotenoids also protect against excess energy damage by dissipating it as heat."

For example, when it\u2019s hot outside, plants tend\nto keep their stomata closed to prevent excessive water loss; when the outside temperature cools, stomata open and plants\ntake in CO2 and use a more efficient system to feed it into the Calvin cycle.\nAs we explored in Overview of Photosynthesis, photosynthesis forms an energy link with cellular respiration. Plants need\nboth photosynthesis and respiration in order to conduct metabolic processes during both light and dark times. Therefore,\nplant cells contain both chloroplasts and mitochondria.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section, support concepts and learning objectives outlined\nin Big Idea 2 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework, as shown in the table. The learning objectives listed in\nthe Curriculum Framework provide a transparent foundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory\nexperience, instructional activities, and AP\u00ae exam questions.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 2.5][APLO 2.11][APLO 4.17]\nThe Calvin Cycle\nAfter the energy from the sun is converted into chemical energy and temporarily stored in ATP and NADPH molecules, the\ncell has the fuel needed to build carbohydrate molecules for long-term energy storage. The products of the light-dependent\nreactions, ATP and NADPH, have lifespans in the range of millionths of seconds, whereas the products of the light-\nindependent reactions (carbohydrates and other forms of reduced carbon) can survive for hundreds of millions of years. The\ncarbohydrate molecules made will have a backbone of carbon atoms. Where does the carbon come from? It comes from\ncarbon dioxide, the gas that is a waste product of respiration in microbes, fungi, plants, and animals.\nIn plants, carbon dioxide (CO2) enters the leaves through stomata, where it diffuses over short distances through\nintercellular spaces until it reaches the mesophyll cells. Once in the mesophyll cells, CO2 diffuses into the stroma of\nthe chloroplast\u2014the site of light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. These reactions actually have several names\nassociated with them. Another term, the Calvin cycle, is named for the man who discovered it, and because these reactions\nfunction as a cycle. Others call it the Calvin-Benson cycle to include the name of another scientist involved in its discovery.\nThe most outdated name is dark reactions, because light is not directly required (Figure 8.18). However, the term dark\nreaction can be misleading because it implies incorrectly that the reaction only occurs at night or is independent of light,\nwhich is why most scientists and instructors no longer use it.\n348\nChapter 8 | Photosynthesis\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 8.18 Light reactions harness energy from the sun to produce chemical bonds, ATP, and NADPH. These energy-\ncarrying molecules are made in the stroma where carbon fixation takes place.\nThe light-independent reactions of the Calvin cycle can be organized into three basic stages: fixation, reduction, and\nregeneration.\nStage 1: Fixation\nIn the stroma, in addition to CO2, two other components are present to initiate the light-independent reactions: an enzyme\ncalled ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), and three molecules of ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP),\nas shown in Figure 8.19. RuBP has five atoms of carbon, flanked by two phosphates.\nChapter 8 | Photosynthesis\n349\nFigure 8.19 The Calvin cycle has three stages. In stage 1, the enzyme RuBisCO incorporates carbon dioxide into\nan organic molecule, 3-PGA. In stage 2, the organic molecule is reduced using electrons supplied by NADPH. In\nstage 3, RuBP, the molecule that starts the cycle, is regenerated so that the cycle can continue. Only one carbon\ndioxide molecule is incorporated at a time, so the cycle must be completed three times to produce a single three-\ncarbon GA3P molecule, and six times to produce a six-carbon glucose molecule.\nWhich of the following statements is true?\na.\nIn photosynthesis, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ATP and NADPH are reactants. GA3P and water are products.\nb.\nIn photosynthesis, chlorophyll, water and carbon dioxide are reactants. GA3P and oxygen are products.\nc.\nIn photosynthesis, water, carbon dioxide, ATP and NADPH are reactants. RuBP and oxygen are products.\nd.\nIn photosynthesis, water and carbon dioxide are reactants. GA3P and oxygen are products.\nRuBisCO catalyzes a reaction between CO2 and RuBP. For each CO2 molecule that reacts with one RuBP, two molecules\nof another compound (3-PGA) form. PGA has three carbons and one phosphate. Each turn of the cycle involves only one\nRuBP and one carbon dioxide and forms two molecules of 3-PGA. The number of carbon atoms remains the same, as the\natoms move to form new bonds during the reactions (3 atoms from 3CO2 + 15 atoms from 3RuBP = 18 atoms in 3 atoms of\n3-PGA). This process is called carbon fixation, because CO2 is \u201cfixed\u201d from an inorganic form into organic molecules.\nStage 2: Reduction\nATP and NADPH are used to convert the six molecules of 3-PGA into six molecules of a chemical called glyceraldehyde\n3-phosphate (G3P). That is a reduction reaction because it involves the gain of electrons by 3-PGA. Recall that a reduction\nis the gain of an electron by an atom or molecule. Six molecules of both ATP and NADPH are used. For ATP, energy is\nreleased with the loss of the terminal phosphate atom, converting it into ADP; for NADPH, both energy and a hydrogen\natom are lost, converting it into NADP+. Both of these molecules return to the nearby light-dependent reactions to be reused\nand reenergized.\nStage 3: Regeneration\nInterestingly, at this point, only one of the G3P molecules leaves the Calvin cycle and is sent to the cytoplasm to contribute\nto the formation of other compounds needed by the plant. Because the G3P exported from the chloroplast has three carbon\natoms, it takes three \u201cturns\u201d of the Calvin cycle to fix enough net carbon to export one G3P. But each turn makes two G3Ps,\nthus three turns make six G3Ps. One is exported while the remaining five G3P molecules remain in the cycle and are used\n350\nChapter 8 | Photosynthesis\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nto regenerate RuBP, which enables the system to prepare for more CO2 to be fixed.

These variations increase the efficiency of water usage, helping to\nconserve water and energy. (credit: Piotr Wojtkowski)\nWhich of the following events is associated with the development of oxygenic photosynthesis?\na.\nPhotosynthetic organisms began to use NADPH and ATP as an energy source.\nb.\nPhotosynthetic organisms evolved from single-celled bacteria into multicellular plants.\nc.\nPhotosynthetic organisms began to use two photosystems instead of one.\nd.\nPhotosynthetic organisms began to use light reactions as well as dark reactions.\nThe Energy Cycle\nWhether the organism is a bacterium, plant, or animal, all living things access energy by breaking down carbohydrate\nmolecules. But if plants make carbohydrate molecules, why would they need to break them down, especially when it has\nbeen shown that the gas organisms release as a \u201cwaste product\u201d (CO2) acts as a substrate for the formation of more food in\nphotosynthesis? Remember, living things need energy to perform life functions. In addition, an organism can either make\nits own food or eat another organism\u2014either way, the food still needs to be broken down. Finally, in the process of breaking\ndown food, called cellular respiration, heterotrophs release needed energy and produce \u201cwaste\u201d in the form of CO2 gas.\nIn nature, there is no such thing as waste. Every single atom of matter and energy is conserved, recycling over and\nover infinitely. Substances change form or move from one type of molecule to another, but their constituent atoms never\ndisappear. (Figure 1.21 is an illustrative example of this process.)\nCO2 is no more a form of waste than oxygen is wasteful to photosynthesis. Both are byproducts of reactions that move\non to other reactions. Photosynthesis absorbs light energy to build carbohydrates in chloroplasts, and aerobic cellular\nrespiration releases energy by using oxygen to metabolize carbohydrates in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Both processes\nuse electron transport chains to capture the energy necessary to drive other reactions. These two powerhouse processes,\nphotosynthesis and cellular respiration, function in biological, cyclical harmony to allow organisms to access life-sustaining\nenergy that originates millions of miles away in a burning star humans call the sun.\n352\nChapter 8 | Photosynthesis\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 8.21 Photosynthesis consumes carbon dioxide and produces oxygen. Aerobic respiration consumes oxygen\nand produces carbon dioxide. These two processes play an important role in the carbon cycle. (credit: modification of\nwork by Stuart Bassil)\nPhotosynthesis and aerobic respiration are interrelated in important ways. During photosynthesis, plants\ntake in carbon dioxide and water. The water molecule is split, the oxygen is released into the atmosphere,\nand the carbon dioxide is used to build carbohydrates. During aerobic respiration, organisms take in water\nand oxygen for respiration and produce carbon dioxide.\nThe Earth did not contain oxygen in its atmosphere throughout much of its history, even after life on Earth had already\nbegan. It did, however, contain carbon dioxide. What does this suggest about when photosynthetic organisms evolved,\nrelative to non-photosynthetic organisms, and why?\na.\nPhotosynthetic organisms evolved before non-photosynthetic organisms because no oxygen was present in\nthe atmosphere when life began.\nb.\nPhotosynthetic organisms evolved after non-photosynthetic organisms because no oxygen was present in the\natmosphere when life began.\nc.\nNon-photosynthetic organisms evolved before photosynthetic organisms because no oxygen was present in\nthe atmosphere when life began.\nd.\nPhotosynthetic organisms evolved before non-photosynthetic organisms because no oxygen was present in\nthe atmosphere when life began.\nChapter 8 | Photosynthesis\n353\nActivity\nCreate a model or diagram to show the links between photosynthesis and cellular respiration.\nThink About It\nWhat cellular features and processes are similar in both respiration and photosynthesis?\n354\nChapter 8 | Photosynthesis\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nabsorption spectrum\nantenna protein\nCalvin cycle\ncarbon fixation\ncarotenoid\nchemoautotroph\nchlorophyll a\nchlorophyll b\nchloroplast\ncytochrome complex\nelectromagnetic spectrum\nelectron transport chain\ngranum\nheterotroph\nlight harvesting complex\nlight-dependent reaction\nlight-independent reaction\nmesophyll\nP680\nP700\nphotoact\nphotoautotroph\nphoton\nphotosystem\nphotosystem I\nKEY TERMS\nrange of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation absorbed by a given substance\npigment molecule that directly absorbs light and transfers the energy absorbed to other pigment\nmolecules\nlight-independent reactions of photosynthesis that convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into\ncarbohydrates using the energy and reducing power of ATP and NADPH\nprocess of converting inorganic CO2 gas into organic compounds\nphotosynthetic pigment that functions to dispose of excess energy\norganism that can build organic molecules using energy derived from inorganic chemicals instead of\nsunlight\nform of chlorophyll that absorbs violet-blue and red light and consequently has a bluish-green color;

        "summary": "The Calvin cycle, or light-independent reactions of photosynthesis, uses the ATP and NADPH generated in the light-dependent reactions to convert atmospheric CO\u2082 into organic molecules. Occurring in the chloroplast stroma, it consists of three stages: fixation, reduction, and regeneration. In fixation, the enzyme RuBisCO catalyzes the incorporation of CO\u2082 into ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), producing 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA). In reduction, ATP and NADPH reduce 3-PGA into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), with one G3P exiting the cycle after three turns to contribute to carbohydrate formation while the rest are used to regenerate RuBP. Regeneration requires ATP and ensures the cycle can continue fixing CO\u2082. Three turns of the cycle are needed for one net G3P molecule, and six turns yield enough carbon for one glucose. Certain plants have evolved modifications to improve CO\u2082 capture under limiting conditions, such as closed stomata in hot environments. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are interconnected in the energy cycle, with photosynthesis storing energy in carbohydrates and respiration releasing it for cellular processes, continually recycling CO\u2082 and O\u2082 in a balanced system that sustains life."

You would not be able to express\nyour wishes, nor could you ask questions to find out more about your environment. Social organization is dependent on\ncommunication between the individuals; without communication, society would fall apart.\nAs with people, it is vital for a cell to interact with its environment. This is true whether it is a unicellular organism or one\nof many cells forming a larger organism. In order to respond to external stimuli, cells have developed complex mechanisms\nof communication that can receive a message, transfer the information across the plasma membrane, and produce changes\nwithin the cell in response to the message. In multicellular organisms, cells send and receive chemical messages constantly\nto coordinate the actions of distant organs, tissues, and cells.\nWhile the necessity for cellular communication in larger organisms seems obvious, even single-celled organisms\ncommunicate with each other. Yeast cells signal each other to aid in mating. Some forms of bacteria coordinate their actions\nin order to form large complexes called biofilms (Figure 9.18) or to organize the production of toxins to remove competing\norganisms. The ability of cells to communicate through chemical signals originated in single cells and was essential for the\nevolution of multicellular organisms.\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\n365\nCell signaling is vital to the survival of organisms. For example, chemical signals tell cells when to make hormones such as\ninsulin. Cell division also depends on chemical signals. When the chemical signals do not function properly, cells can divide\nuncontrollably, forming cancerous tumors. Scientists recently discovered a cell signaling pathway that protects cancer cells\nfrom being killed by the body\u2019s immune system. The hope is to use this knowledge to create treatments that target this cell\nsignaling pathway so that the cancer cells self destruct. More about that can be found here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/\n32cancerdefense) : \u201cScientists pinpoint a new line of defense used by cancer cells.\u201d\n9.1 | Signaling Molecules and Cellular Receptors\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the four types of signaling that are found in multicellular organisms?\n\u2022\nWhat are the differences between internal receptors and cell-surface receptors?\n\u2022\nWhat is the relationship between a ligand\u2019s structure and its mechanism of action?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nJust like you communicate with your classmates face-to-face, using your phone, or via e-mail, cells communicate with\neach other by both inter\u2019and intracellular signaling. Cells detect and respond to changes in the environment using signaling\npathways. Signaling pathways enable organisms to coordinate cellular activities and metabolic processes. Errors in these\npathways can cause disease. Signaling cells secrete molecules called ligands that bind to target cells and initiate a chain\nof events within the target cell. For example, when epinephrine is released, binding to target cells, those cells respond by\nconverting glycogen to glucose. Cell communication can happen over short distances. For example, neurotransmitters are\nreleased across a synapse to transfer messages between neurons Figure 1.3. Gap junctions and plasmodesmata allow small\nmolecules, including signaling molecules, to flow between neighboring cells. Cell communication can also happen over\nlong distances using. For example, hormones released from endocrine cells travel to target cells in multiple body systems.\nHow does a ligand such as a hormone traveling through the bloodstream \u201cknow\u201d when it has reached its target organ\nto initiate a cellular response? Nearly all cell signaling pathways involve three stages: reception, signal transduction, and\ncellular response.\nCell signaling pathways begin when the ligand binds to a receptor, a protein that is embedded in the plasma membrane of the\ntarget cell or found in the cell cytoplasm. The receptors are very specific, and each ligand is recognized by a different one.\nThis stage of the pathway is called reception. Molecules that are nonpolar, such as steroids, diffuse across the cell membrane\nand bind to internal receptors. In turn, the receptor-ligand complex moves to the nucleus and interacts with cellular DNA.\nThis changes how a gene is expressed. Polar ligands, on the other hand, interact with membrane receptor protein. Some\nmembrane receptors work by changing conformation so that certain ions, such as Na+ and K+, can pass through the plasma\nmembrane. Other membrane receptors interact with a G-protein on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, which\ncauses a series of reactions inside the cell. Disruptions to this process are linked to several diseases, including cholera.\nIt is important to keep in mind that each cell has a variety of receptors, allowing it to respond to a variety of stimuli. Some\nreceptors can bind several different ligands; for example, odorant molecules/receptors associated with the sense of smell in\nanimals. Once the signaling molecule and receptor interact, a cascade of events called signal transduction usually amplifies\nthe signal inside the cell.\nThe content presented in this section supports the Learning Objectives outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP\u00ae Biology\nCurriculum Framework listed.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 3.33][APLO 3.36]\nThere are two kinds of communication in the world of living cells. Communication between cells is called intercellular\nsignaling, and communication within a cell is called intracellular signaling. An easy way to remember the distinction is by\nunderstanding the Latin origin of the prefixes: inter- means \"between\" (for example, intersecting lines are those that cross\neach other) and intra- means \"inside\" (like intravenous).\nChemical signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small, usually volatile or soluble molecules called ligands.\nA ligand is a molecule that binds another specific molecule, in some cases, delivering a signal in the process. Ligands can\nthus be thought of as signaling molecules. Ligands interact with proteins in target cells, which are cells that are affected\nby chemical signals; these proteins are also called receptors. Ligands and receptors exist in several varieties; however, a\nspecific ligand will have a specific receptor that typically binds only that ligand.\nForms of Signaling\nThere are four categories of chemical signaling found in multicellular organisms: paracrine signaling, endocrine signaling,\nautocrine signaling, and direct signaling across gap junctions (Figure 9.2). The main difference between the different\ncategories of signaling is the distance that the signal travels through the organism to reach the target cell. Not all cells are\naffected by the same signals.\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\n367\nFigure 9.2 In chemical signaling, a cell may target itself (autocrine signaling), a cell connected by gap junctions,\na nearby cell (paracrine signaling), or a distant cell (endocrine signaling). Paracrine signaling acts on nearby cells,\nendocrine signaling uses the circulatory system to transport ligands, and autocrine signaling acts on the signaling cell.\nSignaling via gap junctions involves signaling molecules moving directly between adjacent cells.\nParacrine Signaling\nSignals that act locally between cells that are close together are called paracrine signals. Paracrine signals move by\ndiffusion through the extracellular matrix. These types of signals usually elicit quick responses that last only a short amount\nof time. In order to keep the response localized, paracrine ligand molecules are normally quickly degraded by enzymes\nor removed by neighboring cells. Removing the signals will reestablish the concentration gradient for the signal, allowing\nthem to quickly diffuse through the intracellular space if released again.\nOne example of paracrine signaling is the transfer of signals across synapses between nerve cells. A nerve cell consists of\na cell body, several short, branched extensions called dendrites that receive stimuli, and a long extension called an axon,\nwhich transmits signals to other nerve cells or muscle cells. The junction between nerve cells where signal transmission\noccurs is called a synapse. A synaptic signal is a chemical signal that travels between nerve cells. Signals within the nerve\ncells are propagated by fast-moving electrical impulses. When these impulses reach the end of the axon, the signal continues\non to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell (the\ncell emitting the signal). The neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances between nerve cells, which\nare called chemical synapses (Figure 9.3). The small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly; this\nenables an immediate response, such as, Take your hand off the stove!\nWhen the neurotransmitter binds the receptor on the surface of the postsynaptic cell, the electrochemical potential of the\ntarget cell changes, and the next electrical impulse is launched. The neurotransmitters that are released into the chemical\nsynapse are degraded quickly or get reabsorbed by the presynaptic cell so that the recipient nerve cell can recover quickly\nand be prepared to respond rapidly to the next synaptic signal.\n368\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 9.3 The distance between the presynaptic cell and the postsynaptic cell\u2014called the synaptic gap\u2014is very\nsmall and allows for rapid diffusion of the neurotransmitter. Enzymes in the synapatic cleft degrade some types of\nneurotransmitters to terminate the signal.\nEndocrine Signaling\nSignals from distant cells are called endocrine signals, and they originate from endocrine cells. (In the body, many\nendocrine cells are located in endocrine glands, such as the thyroid gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary gland.)\nThese types of signals usually produce a slower response but have a longer-lasting effect. The ligands released in endocrine\nsignaling are called hormones, signaling molecules that are produced in one part of the body but affect other body regions\nsome distance away.\nHormones travel the large distances between endocrine cells and their target cells via the bloodstream, which is a relatively\nslow way to move throughout the body. Because of their form of transport, hormones get diluted and are present in low\nconcentrations when they act on their target cells. This is different from paracrine signaling, in which local concentrations\nof ligands can be very high.\nAutocrine Signaling\nAutocrine signals are produced by signaling cells that can also bind to the ligand that is released. This means the signaling\ncell and the target cell can be the same or a similar cell (the prefix auto- means self, a reminder that the signaling cell sends a\nsignal to itself). This type of signaling often occurs during the early development of an organism to ensure that cells develop\ninto the correct tissues and take on the proper function. Autocrine signaling also regulates pain sensation and inflammatory\nresponses. Further, if a cell is infected with a virus, the cell can signal itself to undergo programmed cell death, killing\nthe virus in the process. In some cases, neighboring cells of the same type are also influenced by the released ligand. In\nembryological development, this process of stimulating a group of neighboring cells may help to direct the differentiation\nof identical cells into the same cell type, thus ensuring the proper developmental outcome.\nDirect Signaling Across Gap Junctions\nGap junctions in animals and plasmodesmata in plants are connections between the plasma membranes of neighboring cells.\nThese fluid-filled channels allow small signaling molecules, called intracellular mediators, to diffuse between the two\ncells. Small molecules, such as calcium ions (Ca2+), are able to move between cells, but large molecules like proteins and\nDNA cannot fit through the channels. The specificity of the channels ensures that the cells remain independent but can\nquickly and easily transmit signals. The transfer of signaling molecules communicates the current state of the cell that is\ndirectly next to the target cell; this allows a group of cells to coordinate their response to a signal that only one of them may\nhave received. In plants, plasmodesmata are ubiquitous, making the entire plant into a giant communication network.\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\n369\nTypes of Receptors\nReceptors are protein molecules in the target cell or on its surface that bind ligand. There are two types of receptors, internal\nreceptors and cell-surface receptors.\nInternal receptors\nInternal receptors, also known as intracellular or cytoplasmic receptors, are found in the cytoplasm of the cell and respond\nto hydrophobic ligand molecules that are able to travel across the plasma membrane. Once inside the cell, many of these\nmolecules bind to proteins that act as regulators of mRNA synthesis (transcription) to mediate gene expression. Gene\nexpression is the cellular process of transforming the information in a cell's DNA into a sequence of amino acids, which\nultimately forms a protein. When the ligand binds to the internal receptor, a conformational change is triggered that exposes\na DNA-binding site on the protein. The ligand-receptor complex moves into the nucleus, then binds to specific regulatory\nregions of the chromosomal DNA and promotes the initiation of transcription (Figure 9.4). Transcription is the process\nof copying the information in a cells DNA into a special form of RNA called messenger RNA (mRNA); the cell uses\ninformation in the mRNA (which moves out into the cytoplasm and associates with ribosomes) to link specific amino acids\nin the correct order, producing a protein. Internal receptors can directly influence gene expression without having to pass\nthe signal on to other receptors or messengers.\nFigure 9.4 Hydrophobic signaling molecules typically diffuse across the plasma membrane and interact with\nintracellular receptors in the cytoplasm. Many intracellular receptors are transcription factors that interact with DNA in\nthe nucleus and regulate gene expression.\nCell-Surface Receptors\nCell-surface receptors, also known as transmembrane receptors, are cell surface, membrane-anchored (integral) proteins\nthat bind to external ligand molecules. This type of receptor spans the plasma membrane and performs signal transduction,\nin which an extracellular signal is converted into an intracellular signal. Ligands that interact with cell-surface receptors do\nnot have to enter the cell that they affect. Cell-surface receptors are also called cell-specific proteins or markers because\nthey are specific to individual cell types.\nBecause cell-surface receptor proteins are fundamental to normal cell functioning, it should come as no surprise that a\nmalfunction in any one of these proteins could have severe consequences. Errors in the protein structures of certain receptor\nmolecules have been shown to play a role in hypertension (high blood pressure), asthma, heart disease, and cancer.\nEach cell-surface receptor has three main components: an external ligand-binding domain, a hydrophobic membrane-\nspanning region, and an intracellular domain inside the cell. The ligand-binding domain is also called the extracellular\ndomain. The size and extent of each of these domains vary widely, depending on the type of receptor.\n370\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nHow Viruses Recognize a Host\nUnlike living cells, many viruses do not have a plasma membrane or any of the structures necessary\nto sustain life. Some viruses are simply composed of an inert protein shell containing DNA or RNA. To\nreproduce, viruses must invade a living cell, which serves as a host, and then take over the hosts cellular\napparatus. But how does a virus recognize its host?\nViruses often bind to cell-surface receptors on the host cell. For example, the virus that causes human\ninfluenza (flu) binds specifically to receptors on membranes of cells of the respiratory system. Chemical\ndifferences in the cell-surface receptors among hosts mean that a virus that infects a specific species (for\nexample, humans) cannot infect another species (for example, chickens).\nHowever, viruses have very small amounts of DNA or RNA compared to humans, and, as a result, viral\nreproduction can occur rapidly. Viral reproduction invariably produces errors that can lead to changes in\nnewly produced viruses; these changes mean that the viral proteins that interact with cell-surface receptors\nmay evolve in such a way that they can bind to receptors in a new host. Such changes happen randomly\nand quite often in the reproductive cycle of a virus, but the changes only matter if a virus with new binding\nproperties comes into contact with a suitable host. In the case of influenza, this situation can occur in\nsettings where animals and people are in close contact, such as poultry and swine farms. [1] Once a virus\njumps to a new host, it can spread quickly. Scientists watch newly appearing viruses (called emerging\nviruses) closely in the hope that such monitoring can reduce the likelihood of global viral epidemics.\nWhat requirements must be met for a new virus to emerge and spread?\na.\nThe virus must infect at least two different animals before infecting humans.\nb.\nThe virus must come into contact with a new host so mutations will occur which allow the virus to bind to\nthat host.\nc.\nA mutation must occur in the host allowing the virus to bind to the host.\nd.\nA mutation must occur in the virus allowing the virus to infect a new host, and the virus must come into\ncontact with this host.\nCell-surface receptors are involved in most of the signaling in multicellular organisms. There are three general categories\nof cell-surface receptors: ion channel-linked receptors, G-protein-linked receptors, and enzyme-linked receptors.\nIon channel-linked receptors bind a ligand and open a channel through the membrane that allows specific ions to pass\nthrough. To form a channel, this type of cell-surface receptor has an extensive membrane-spanning region. In order to\ninteract with the phospholipid fatty acid tails that form the center of the plasma membrane, many of the amino acids in the\nmembrane-spanning region are hydrophobic in nature. Conversely, the amino acids that line the inside of the channel are\nhydrophilic to allow for the passage of water or ions. When a ligand binds to the extracellular region of the channel, there\nis a conformational change in the proteins structure that allows ions such as sodium, calcium, magnesium, and hydrogen to\npass through (Figure 9.5).\n1.

The open pore then allows ions to flow into or out of the cell.\nG-protein-linked receptors bind a ligand and activate a membrane protein called a G-protein. The activated G-protein then\ninteracts with either an ion channel or an enzyme in the membrane (Figure 9.6). All G-protein-linked receptors have seven\ntransmembrane domains, but each receptor has its own specific extracellular domain and G-protein-binding site.\nCell signaling using G-protein-linked receptors occurs as a cyclic series of events. Before the ligand binds, the inactive G-\nprotein can bind to a newly revealed site on the receptor specific for its binding. Once the G-protein binds to the receptor,\nthe resultant shape change activates the G-protein, which releases GDP and picks up GTP. The subunits of the G-protein\nthen split into the \u03b1 subunit and the \u03b2\u03b3 subunit. One or both of these G-protein fragments may be able to activate other\nproteins as a result. After awhile, the GTP on the active \u03b1 subunit of the G-protein is hydrolyzed to GDP and the \u03b2\u03b3 subunit\nis deactivated. The subunits reassociate to form the inactive G-protein and the cycle begins anew.\nFigure 9.6 Heterotrimeric G proteins have three subunits: \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3. When a signaling molecule binds to a G-protein-\ncoupled receptor in the plasma membrane, a GDP molecule associated with the \u03b1 subunit is exchanged for GTP. The\n\u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits dissociate from the \u03b1 subunit, and a cellular response is triggered either by the \u03b1 subunit or the\ndissociated \u03b2\u03b3 pair. Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP terminates the signal.\n372\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nG-protein-linked receptors have been extensively studied and much has been learned about their roles in maintaining health.\nBacteria that are pathogenic to humans can release poisons that interrupt specific G-protein-linked receptor function, leading\nto illnesses such as pertussis, botulism, and cholera. In cholera (Figure 9.7), for example, the water-borne bacterium Vibrio\ncholerae produces a toxin, choleragen, that binds to cells lining the small intestine. The toxin then enters these intestinal\ncells, where it modifies a G-protein that controls the opening of a chloride channel and causes it to remain continuously\nactive, resulting in large losses of fluids from the body and potentially fatal dehydration as a result.\nFigure 9.7 Transmitted primarily through contaminated drinking water, cholera is a major cause of death in the\ndeveloping world and in areas where natural disasters interrupt the availability of clean water. The cholera bacterium,\nVibrio cholerae, creates a toxin that modifies G-protein-mediated cell signaling pathways in the intestines. Modern\nsanitation eliminates the threat of cholera outbreaks, such as the one that swept through New York City in 1866. This\nposter from that era shows how, at that time, the way that the disease was transmitted was not understood. (credit:\nNew York City Sanitary Commission)\nEnzyme-linked receptors are cell-surface receptors with intracellular domains that are associated with an enzyme. In\nsome cases, the intracellular domain of the receptor itself is an enzyme. Other enzyme-linked receptors have a small\nintracellular domain that interacts directly with an enzyme. The enzyme-linked receptors normally have large extracellular\nand intracellular domains, but the membrane-spanning region consists of a single alpha-helical region of the peptide strand.\nWhen a ligand binds to the extracellular domain, a signal is transferred through the membrane, activating the enzyme.\nActivation of the enzyme sets off a chain of events within the cell that eventually leads to a response. One example of this\ntype of enzyme-linked receptor is the tyrosine kinase receptor (Figure 9.8). A kinase is an enzyme that transfers phosphate\ngroups from ATP to another protein. The tyrosine kinase receptor transfers phosphate groups to tyrosine molecules (tyrosine\nresidues). First, signaling molecules bind to the extracellular domain of two nearby tyrosine kinase receptors. The two\nneighboring receptors then bond together, or dimerize. Phosphates are then added to tyrosine residues on the intracellular\ndomain of the receptors (phosphorylation). The phosphorylated residues can then transmit the signal to the next messenger\nwithin the cytoplasm.\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\n373\nFigure 9.8 A receptor tyrosine kinase is an enzyme-linked receptor with a single transmembrane region, and\nextracellular and intracellular domains. Binding of a signaling molecule to the extracellular domain causes the\nreceptor to dimerize. Tyrosine residues on the intracellular domain are then autophosphorylated, triggering a\ndownstream cellular response. The signal is terminated by a phosphatase that removes the phosphates from the\nphosphotyrosine residues.\nHER2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase. In 20 percent of human breast cancer cases, HER2 is permanently activated,\nresulting in unregulated cell division. Lapatinib, a drug used to treat breast cancer, inhibits HER2 receptor tyrosine\nkinase autophosphorylation, the process by which the receptor adds phosphates onto itself. This reduces tumor growth\nby 50 percent. Besides autophosphorylation, which of the following steps would be inhibited by Lapatinib?\na.\ndimerization and the downstream cellular response\nb.\nphosphatase activity, dimerization, and the downstream cellular response\nc.\nsignaling molecule binding, dimerization, and the downstream cellular response\nd.\nthe downstream cellular response\n374\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nSignaling Molecules\nProduced by signaling cells and the subsequent binding to receptors in target cells, ligands act as chemical signals that travel\nto the target cells to coordinate responses. The types of molecules that serve as ligands are incredibly varied and range from\nsmall proteins to small ions like calcium (Ca2+).\nSmall Hydrophobic Ligands\nSmall hydrophobic ligands can directly diffuse through the plasma membrane and interact with internal receptors. Important\nmembers of this class of ligands are the steroid hormones. Steroids are lipids that have a hydrocarbon skeleton with four\nfused rings; different steroids have different functional groups attached to the carbon skeleton. Steroid hormones include\nthe female sex hormone, estradiol, which is a type of estrogen; the male sex hormone, testosterone; and cholesterol, which\nis an important structural component of biological membranes and a precursor of steriod hormones (Figure 9.9). Other\nhydrophobic hormones include thyroid hormones and vitamin D. In order to be soluble in blood, hydrophobic ligands must\nbind to carrier proteins while they are being transported through the bloodstream.\nFigure 9.9 Steroid hormones have similar chemical structures to their precursor, cholesterol. Because these molecules\nare small and hydrophobic, they can diffuse directly across the plasma membrane into the cell, where they interact\nwith internal receptors.\nWater-Soluble Ligands\nWater-soluble ligands are polar and therefore cannot pass through the plasma membrane unaided; sometimes, they are too\nlarge to pass through the membrane at all. Instead, most water-soluble ligands bind to the extracellular domain of cell-\nsurface receptors. This group of ligands is quite diverse and includes small molecules, peptides, and proteins.\nOther Ligands\nNitric oxide (NO) is a gas that also acts as a ligand. It is able to diffuse directly across the plasma membrane, and one of\nits roles is to interact with receptors in smooth muscle and induce relaxation of the tissue. NO has a very short half-life and\ntherefore only functions over short distances. Nitroglycerin, a treatment for heart disease, acts by triggering the release of\nNO, which causes blood vessels to dilate (expand), thus restoring blood flow to the heart.\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\n375\nThink About It\n\u2022\nCells grown in the laboratory are placed in a solution containing a dye that is unable to pass through\nthe plasma membrane. If a ligand is then added to the solution, observations show that the dye enters\nthe cell.

In 30 percent of human breast cancers, HER2 is permanently\nactivated, resulting in unregulated cell division. Lapatinib, a drug used to treat breast cancer, inhibits\nHER2 receptor tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation (the process by which the receptor adds\nphosphate onto itself), thus reducing tumor growth. Besides autophosphorylation, explain another\nfeature of the cell signaling pathway that can be affected by Lapatinib.\n\u2022\nIn certain cancers, the GTPase activity of RAS G-protein in inhibited. This means that the RAS G-\nprotein can no longer hydrolyze GTP into GDP.

        "summary": "In multicellular organisms, cell communication occurs through chemical signals called ligands, which bind to specific receptors on target cells to trigger a response. There are four main types of signaling: paracrine (short-distance, local signals such as neurotransmitters), endocrine (long-distance hormone signaling via the bloodstream), autocrine (signals affecting the same or similar cells, including self-signaling), and direct signaling via gap junctions or plasmodesmata (allowing small molecules to pass directly between adjacent cells). Receptors can be internal (binding hydrophobic ligands like steroid hormones that diffuse through membranes to regulate gene expression) or cell-surface receptors (binding external ligands and initiating signal transduction without ligand entry). Cell-surface receptors include ion channel-linked receptors (ligand binding opens ion channels), G-protein-linked receptors (activating membrane G-proteins to influence other proteins), and enzyme-linked receptors (often activating enzymes like receptor tyrosine kinases to trigger downstream responses). Ligands vary from small hydrophobic molecules and water-soluble peptides/proteins to gaseous signaling molecules like nitric oxide. The specificity of ligand-receptor interactions ensures precise communication, and disruptions in these pathways can lead to diseases such as cancer, hypertension, and infectious illnesses."

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 3.33][APLO 3.4][APLO 4.22][APLO 2.5][APLO 3.32][APLO 3.38]\nOnce a ligand binds to a receptor, the signal is transmitted through the membrane and into the cytoplasm. Continuation of\na signal in this manner is called signal transduction. Signal transduction only occurs with cell-surface receptors because\ninternal receptors are able to interact directly with DNA in the nucleus to initiate protein synthesis.\nWhen a ligand binds to its receptor, conformational changes occur that affect the receptor\u2019s intracellular domain.\nConformational changes of the extracellular domain upon ligand binding can propagate through the membrane region of\nthe receptor and lead to activation of the intracellular domain or its associated proteins. In some cases, binding of the ligand\ncauses dimerization of the receptor, which means that two receptors bind to each other to form a stable complex called\na dimer. A dimer is a chemical compound formed when two molecules (often identical) join together. The binding of the\nreceptors in this manner enables their intracellular domains to come into close contact and activate each other.\nBinding Initiates a Signaling Pathway\nAfter the ligand binds to the cell-surface receptor, the activation of the receptor\u2019s intracellular components sets off a chain\nof events that is called a signaling pathway or a signaling cascade. In a signaling pathway, second messengers, enzymes,\nand activated proteins interact with specific proteins, which are in turn activated in a chain reaction that eventually leads to\na change in the cell\u2019s environment (Figure 9.10). The events in the cascade occur in a series, much like a current flows in\na river. Interactions that occur before a certain point are defined as upstream events, and events after that point are called\ndownstream events.\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\n377\nFigure 9.10 The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in\nthe regulation of cell growth, wound healing, and tissue repair. When EGF binds to the EGFR, a cascade of\ndownstream events causes the cell to grow and divide. If EGFR is activated at inappropriate times, uncontrolled\ncell growth may occur.\nIn certain cancers, the GTPase activity of the RAS G-protein is inhibited. This means that the RAS protein can no\nlonger hydrolyze GTP into GDP. What effect would this have on downstream cellular events?\na.\nCells will not proliferate.\nb.\nERK is permanently inactivated.\nc.\nRegulated cell division.\nd.\nUncontrolled cell proliferation.\nSignaling pathways can get very complicated very quickly because most cellular proteins can affect different downstream\nevents, depending on the conditions within the cell. A single pathway can branch off toward different endpoints based on\nthe interplay between two or more signaling pathways, and the same ligands are often used to initiate different signals in\n378\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\ndifferent cell types. This variation in response is due to differences in protein expression in different cell types. Another\ncomplicating element is signal integration of the pathways, in which signals from two or more different cell-surface\nreceptors merge to activate the same response in the cell. This process can ensure that multiple external requirements are\nmet before a cell commits to a specific response.\nThe effects of extracellular signals can also be amplified by enzymatic cascades. At the initiation of the signal, a single\nligand binds to a single receptor. However, activation of a receptor-linked enzyme can activate many copies of a component\nof the signaling cascade, which amplifies the signal.\nMethods of Intracellular Signaling\nThe induction of a signaling pathway depends on the modification of a cellular component by an enzyme. There are\nnumerous enzymatic modifications that can occur, and they are recognized in turn by the next component downstream. The\nfollowing are some of the more common events in intracellular signaling.\nObserve an animation of cell signaling at this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/cell_signals) .\nHemophilia is a rare condition in which the blood lacks sufficient clotting factors. These factors are required for the\nplatelets to bind together and form clots. How does this interfere with the cell signals during wound healing?\na.\ndelay and prevention of the cell signal required for wound healing\nb.\nactivate the cell signal required for wound healing\nc.\nactivate and enhance the cell signals for wound healing\nd.\ncell signal will remain unaffected\nPhosphorylation\nOne of the most common chemical modifications that occurs in signaling pathways is the addition of a phosphate group\n(PO4\u20133) to a molecule such as a protein in a process called phosphorylation. The phosphate can be added to a nucleotide\nsuch as GMP to form GDP or GTP. Phosphates are also often added to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues of proteins,\nwhere they replace the hydroxyl group of the amino acid (Figure 9.11). The transfer of the phosphate is catalyzed by an\nenzyme called a kinase. Various kinases are named for the substrate they phosphorylate. Phosphorylation of serine and\nthreonine residues often activates enzymes. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues can either affect the activity of an enzyme\nor create a binding site that interacts with downstream components in the signaling cascade. Phosphorylation may activate\nor inactivate enzymes, and the reversal of phosphorylation, dephosphorylation by a phosphatase, will reverse the effect.\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\n379\nFigure 9.11 In protein phosphorylation, a phosphate group (PO4-3 ) is added to residues of the amino acids serine,\nthreonine, and tyrosine.\nSecond Messengers\nSecond messengers are small molecules that propagate a signal after it has been initiated by the binding of the signaling\nmolecule to the receptor. These molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by altering the behavior of certain\ncellular proteins.\nCalcium ion is a widely used second messenger. The free concentration of calcium ions (Ca2+) within a cell is very low\nbecause ion pumps in the plasma membrane continuously use adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) to remove it. For signaling\npurposes, Ca2+ is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, or accessed from outside the cell. When\nsignaling occurs, ligand-gated calcium ion channels allow the higher levels of Ca2+ that are present outside the cell (or in\nintracellular storage compartments) to flow into the cytoplasm, which raises the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+. The\nresponse to the increase in Ca2+ varies, depending on the cell type involved. For example, in the \u03b2-cells of the pancreas,\nCa2+ signaling leads to the release of insulin, and in muscle cells, an increase in Ca2+ leads to muscle contractions.\nAnother second messenger utilized in many different cell types is cyclic AMP (cAMP). Cyclic AMP is synthesized by the\nenzyme adenylyl cyclase from ATP (Figure 9.12). The main role of cAMP in cells is to bind to and activate an enzyme\ncalled cAMP-dependent kinase (A-kinase). A-kinase regulates many vital metabolic pathways: It phosphorylates serine\nand threonine residues of its target proteins, activating them in the process. A-kinase is found in many different types of\ncells, and the target proteins in each kind of cell are different. Differences give rise to the variation of the responses to cAMP\nin different cells.\n380\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 9.12 This diagram shows the mechanism for the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP serves as a second\nmessenger to activate or inactivate proteins within the cell. Termination of the signal occurs when an enzyme called\nphosphodiesterase converts cAMP into AMP.\nPresent in small concentrations in the plasma membrane, inositol phospholipids are lipids that can also be converted into\nsecond messengers. Because these molecules are membrane components, they are located near membrane-bound receptors\nand can easily interact with them. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) is the main phospholipid that plays a role in cellular signaling.\nEnzymes known as kinases phosphorylate PI to form PI-phosphate (PIP) and PI-bisphosphate (PIP2).\nThe enzyme phospholipase C cleaves PIP2 to form diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) (Figure 9.13).\nThese products of the cleavage of PIP2 serve as second messengers. Diacylglycerol (DAG) remains in the plasma membrane\nand activates protein kinase C (PKC), which then phosphorylates serine and threonine residues in its target proteins. IP3\ndiffuses into the cytoplasm and binds to ligand-gated calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum to release Ca2+ that\ncontinues the signal cascade.\nFigure 9.13 The enzyme phospholipase C breaks down PIP2 into IP3 and DAG, both of which serve as second\nmessengers.\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\n381\nThink About It\nThe same second messengers are used in many different cells, but the response to second messengers is\ndifferent in each cell. How is this possible?\n9.3 | Response to the Signal\nIn this section you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow do signaling pathways direct protein expression, cellular metabolism, and cell growth?\n\u2022\nWhat is the role of apoptosis in the development and maintenance of a healthy organism?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe initiation of a signaling pathway results in a cellular response to changes in the external environment. This response\ncan take many different forms, including protein synthesis, a change in cell metabolism, cell division and growth, or even\ncell death. As we will explore in more detail in later chapters, some pathways activate enzymes that interact within DNA\ntranscription factors to promote gene expression, others can cause cells to store energy as glycogen as fat, or result in free\nenergy availability in the form of glucose. Cell division and growth are almost always stimulated by external signals called\ngrowth factors; left unregulated, cell growth leads to cancer. Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, removes damaged or\nunnecessary cells and plays a vital role in development, including morphogenesis of fingers and toes. Termination of the\ncell signaling cascade is important to ensure that the response to a signal is appropriate in timing and intensity. Degradation\nof signaling molecules and dephosphorylation of intermediates of the pathway are two ways signals are terminated within\ncells. Conditions where signaling pathways are blocked or defective can be deleterious, preventative, or prophylactic;\nexamples include diabetes, heart disease, autoimmune disease, toxins, anesthetics, and birth control pills.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and learning objectives outlined in\nBig Idea 3 and Big Idea 2 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework.

        "summary": "Signal propagation begins when a ligand binds to a cell-surface receptor, causing conformational changes that activate its intracellular domain or associated proteins, sometimes through receptor dimerization. This initiates a signaling pathway, or cascade, in which enzymes, activated proteins, and second messengers sequentially activate downstream components, leading to a cellular response. Pathways can branch, integrate with other signals, and vary by cell type due to differences in protein expression, with enzymatic cascades amplifying the signal from a single ligand-receptor interaction. A key mechanism in these cascades is phosphorylation, catalyzed by kinases, which can activate or inactivate target proteins, with dephosphorylation reversing the effect. Second messengers like calcium ions (Ca\u00b2\u207a), cyclic AMP (cAMP), and lipid-derived molecules such as DAG and IP\u2083 further transmit and amplify signals by modulating protein activity and releasing stored Ca\u00b2\u207a, triggering cell-type-specific responses such as insulin release or muscle contraction."

        "text": "Think About It\nThe same second messengers are used in many different cells, but the response to second messengers is\ndifferent in each cell. How is this possible?\n9.3 | Response to the Signal\nIn this section you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow do signaling pathways direct protein expression, cellular metabolism, and cell growth?\n\u2022\nWhat is the role of apoptosis in the development and maintenance of a healthy organism?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe initiation of a signaling pathway results in a cellular response to changes in the external environment. This response\ncan take many different forms, including protein synthesis, a change in cell metabolism, cell division and growth, or even\ncell death. As we will explore in more detail in later chapters, some pathways activate enzymes that interact within DNA\ntranscription factors to promote gene expression, others can cause cells to store energy as glycogen as fat, or result in free\nenergy availability in the form of glucose. Cell division and growth are almost always stimulated by external signals called\ngrowth factors; left unregulated, cell growth leads to cancer. Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, removes damaged or\nunnecessary cells and plays a vital role in development, including morphogenesis of fingers and toes. Termination of the\ncell signaling cascade is important to ensure that the response to a signal is appropriate in timing and intensity. Degradation\nof signaling molecules and dephosphorylation of intermediates of the pathway are two ways signals are terminated within\ncells. Conditions where signaling pathways are blocked or defective can be deleterious, preventative, or prophylactic;\nexamples include diabetes, heart disease, autoimmune disease, toxins, anesthetics, and birth control pills.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and learning objectives outlined in\nBig Idea 3 and Big Idea 2 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 3.33][APLO 3.35]\nInside the cell, ligands bind to their internal receptors, allowing them to directly affect the cell\u2019s DNA and protein-producing\nmachinery. Using signal transduction pathways, receptors in the plasma membrane produce a variety of effects on the cell.\nThe results of signaling pathways are extremely varied and depend on the type of cell involved as well as the external and\ninternal conditions. A small sampling of responses is described below.\nGene Expression\nSome signal transduction pathways regulate the transcription of RNA. Others regulate the translation of proteins from\nmRNA. An example of a protein that regulates translation in the nucleus is the MAP kinase ERK. ERK is activated\nin a phosphorylation cascade when epidermal growth factor (EGF) binds the EGF receptor (see Figure 9.10). Upon\nphosphorylation, ERK enters the nucleus and activates a protein kinase that, in turn, regulates protein translation (Figure\n9.14).\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\n383\nFigure 9.14 ERK is a MAP kinase that activates translation when it is phosphorylated. ERK phosphorylates MNK1,\nwhich in turn phosphorylates eIF-4E, an elongation initiation factor that, with other initiation factors, is associated with\nmRNA. When eIF-4E becomes phosphorylated, the mRNA unfolds, allowing protein synthesis in the nucleus to begin.\n(See Figure 9.10 for the phosphorylation pathway that activates ERK.)\nThe second kind of protein with which PKC can interact is a protein that acts as an inhibitor. An inhibitor is a molecule\nthat binds to a protein and prevents it from functioning or reduces its function. In this case, the inhibitor is a protein called\nI\u03ba-B, which binds to the regulatory protein NF-\u03baB. (The symbol \u03ba represents the Greek letter kappa.) When I\u03ba-B is bound\nto NF-\u03baB, the complex cannot enter the nucleus of the cell, but when I\u03ba-B is phosphorylated by PKC, it can no longer bind\nNF-\u03baB, and NF-\u03baB (a transcription factor) can enter the nucleus and initiate RNA transcription. In this case, the effect of\nphosphorylation is to inactivate an inhibitor and thereby activate the process of transcription.\nIncrease in Cellular Metabolism\nThe result of another signaling pathway affects muscle cells. The activation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in muscle cells by\nadrenaline leads to an increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) inside the cell. Also known as epinephrine, adrenaline is a hormone\n(produced by the adrenal gland attached to the kidney) that readies the body for short-term emergencies. Cyclic AMP\nactivates PKA (protein kinase A), which in turn phosphorylates two enzymes. The first enzyme promotes the degradation\nof glycogen by activating intermediate glycogen phosphorylase kinase (GPK) that in turn activates glycogen phosphorylase\n(GP) that catabolizes glycogen into glucose. (Recall that your body converts excess glucose to glycogen for short-term\nstorage. When energy is needed, glycogen is quickly reconverted to glucose.) Phosphorylation of the second enzyme,\nglycogen synthase (GS), inhibits its ability to form glycogen from glucose. In this manner, a muscle cell obtains a ready\npool of glucose by activating its formation via glycogen degradation and by inhibiting the use of glucose to form glycogen,\nthus preventing a futile cycle of glycogen degradation and synthesis. The glucose is then available for use by the muscle\ncell in response to a sudden surge of adrenaline\u2014the \u201cfight or flight\u201d reflex.\nCell Growth\nCell signaling pathways also play a major role in cell division. Cells do not normally divide unless they are stimulated\nby signals from other cells. The ligands that promote cell growth are called growth factors. Most growth factors bind to\ncell-surface receptors that are linked to tyrosine kinases. These cell-surface receptors are called receptor tyrosine kinases\n(RTKs). Activation of RTKs initiates a signaling pathway that includes a G-protein called RAS, which activates the MAP\nkinase pathway described earlier. The enzyme MAP kinase then stimulates the expression of proteins that interact with other\ncellular components to initiate cell division.\n384\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nCancer biologists study the molecular origins of cancer with the goal of developing new prevention methods\nand treatment strategies that will inhibit the growth of tumors without harming the normal cells of the\nbody. As mentioned earlier, signaling pathways control cell growth. These signaling pathways are controlled\nby signaling proteins, which are, in turn, expressed by genes. Mutations in these genes can result in\nmalfunctioning signaling proteins. This prevents the cell from regulating its cell cycle, triggering unrestricted\ncell division and cancer. The genes that regulate the signaling proteins are one type of oncogene, which is\na gene that has the potential to cause cancer. The gene encoding RAS is an oncogene that was originally\ndiscovered when mutations in the RAS protein were linked to cancer. Further studies have indicated that 30\npercent of cancer cells have a mutation in the RAS gene that leads to uncontrolled growth. If left unchecked,\nuncontrolled cell division can lead to tumor formation and metastasis, the growth of cancer cells in new\nlocations in the body.\nCancer biologists have been able to identify many other oncogenes that contribute to the development of\ncancer. For example, HER2 is a cell-surface receptor that is present in excessive amounts in 20 percent\nof human breast cancers. Cancer biologists realized that gene duplication led to HER2 overexpression in\n25 percent of breast cancer patients and developed a drug called Herceptin (trastuzumab). Herceptin is\na monoclonal antibody that targets HER2 for removal by the immune system. Herceptin therapy helps to\ncontrol signaling through HER2. The use of Herceptin in combination with chemotherapy has helped to\nincrease the overall survival rate of patients with metastatic breast cancer.\nMore information on cancer biology research can be found at the National Cancer Institute website\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32NCI) .\nCell Death\nWhen a cell is damaged, superfluous, or potentially dangerous to an organism, a cell can initiate a mechanism to trigger\nprogrammed cell death, or apoptosis. Apoptosis allows a cell to die in a controlled manner that prevents the release of\npotentially damaging molecules from inside the cell. There are many internal checkpoints that monitor a cell\u2019s health; if\nabnormalities are observed, a cell can spontaneously initiate the process of apoptosis. However, in some cases, such as a\nviral infection or uncontrolled cell division, the cell\u2019s normal checks and balances fail. External signaling can also initiate\napoptosis. For example, most normal animal cells have receptors that interact with the extracellular matrix, a network of\nglycoproteins that provides structural support for cells in an organism. The binding of cellular receptors to the extracellular\nmatrix initiates a signaling cascade within the cell. However, if the cell moves away from the extracellular matrix, the\nsignaling ceases, and the cell undergoes apoptosis. This system keeps cells from traveling through the body and proliferating\nout of control.\nAnother example of external signaling that leads to apoptosis occurs in T-cell development. T-cells are immune cells that\nbind to foreign macromolecules and particles, and target them for destruction by the immune system. Normally, T-cells do\nnot target \u201cself\u201d proteins (those of their own organism), a process that can lead to autoimmune diseases. In order to develop\nthe ability to discriminate between self and non-self, immature T-cells undergo screening to determine whether they bind\nto so-called self proteins. If the T-cell receptor binds to self proteins, the cell initiates apoptosis to remove the potentially\ndangerous cell.\nApoptosis is also essential for normal embryological development. In vertebrates, for example, early stages of development\ninclude the formation of web-like tissue between individual fingers and toes (Figure 9.15). During the course of normal\ndevelopment, these unneeded cells must be eliminated, enabling fully separated fingers and toes to form. A cell signaling\nmechanism triggers apoptosis, which destroys the cells between the developing digits.\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\n385\nFigure 9.15 The histological section of a foot of a 15-day-old mouse embryo, visualized using light microscopy, reveals\nareas of tissue between the toes, which apoptosis will eliminate before the mouse reaches its full gestational age at 27\ndays. (credit: modification of work by Michal Ma\u00f1as)\nTermination of the Signal Cascade\nThe aberrant signaling often seen in tumor cells is proof that the termination of a signal at the appropriate time can be just\nas important as the initiation of a signal. One method of stopping a specific signal is to degrade the ligand or remove it so\nthat it can no longer access its receptor. One reason that hydrophobic hormones like estrogen and testosterone trigger long-\nlasting events is because they bind carrier proteins. These proteins allow the insoluble molecules to be soluble in blood, but\nthey also protect the hormones from degradation by circulating enzymes.\nInside the cell, many different enzymes reverse the cellular modifications that result from signaling cascades. For example,\nphosphatases are enzymes that remove the phosphate group attached to proteins by kinases in a process called\ndephosphorylation. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is degraded into AMP by phosphodiesterase, and the release of calcium stores is\nreversed by the Ca2+ pumps that are located in the external and internal membranes of the cell.\nActivity\nExplain the mechanism by which a specific disease is caused by a defective signaling pathway.

        "summary": "Cellular responses to signals vary depending on cell type and conditions, and can include changes in gene expression, metabolism, growth, or programmed cell death (apoptosis). Some pathways regulate transcription or translation, such as ERK activating protein synthesis or PKC inactivating inhibitors to trigger transcription. Metabolic responses include adrenaline-activated \u03b2-adrenergic receptors increasing cAMP levels, leading to glycogen breakdown and glucose availability for muscle activity. Growth signals, often mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases and the RAS\u2013MAP kinase pathway, regulate cell division, with mutations in oncogenes like RAS or HER2 leading to uncontrolled proliferation and cancer; targeted therapies such as Herceptin combat such dysregulation. Apoptosis removes damaged, unnecessary, or harmful cells, playing roles in immune function, prevention of autoimmune diseases, and embryonic development (e.g., separation of digits). Proper termination of signaling is vital, accomplished by degrading ligands, dephosphorylation, and reversing secondary messenger effects; failure to do so can contribute to diseases like cancer."

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 3.31][APLO 3.37]\nWithin-cell signaling allows bacteria to respond to environmental cues, such as nutrient levels. Some single-celled\norganisms also release molecules to signal to each other.\nSignaling in Yeast\nYeasts are eukaryotes (fungi), and the components and processes found in yeast signals are similar to those of cell-surface\nreceptor signals in multicellular organisms. Budding yeasts (Figure 9.16) are able to participate in a process that is similar\nto sexual reproduction that entails two haploid cells (cells with one-half the normal number of chromosomes) combining\nto form a diploid cell (a cell with two sets of each chromosome, which is what normal body cells contain). In order to find\nanother haploid yeast cell that is prepared to mate, budding yeasts secrete a signaling molecule called mating factor. When\nmating factor binds to cell-surface receptors in other yeast cells that are nearby, they stop their normal growth cycles and\ninitiate a cell signaling cascade that includes protein kinases and GTP-binding proteins that are similar to G-proteins.\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\n387\nFigure 9.16 Budding Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells can communicate by releasing a signaling molecule\ncalled mating factor. In this micrograph, they are visualized using differential interference contrast microscopy, a light\nmicroscopy technique that enhances the contrast of the sample.\nSignaling in Bacteria\nSignaling in bacteria enables bacteria to monitor extracellular conditions, ensure that there are sufficient amounts of\nnutrients, and ensure that hazardous situations are avoided. There are circumstances, however, when bacteria communicate\nwith each other.\nThe first evidence of bacterial communication was observed in a bacterium that has a symbiotic relationship with Hawaiian\nbobtail squid. When the population density of the bacteria reaches a certain level, specific gene expression is initiated, and\nthe bacteria produce bioluminescent proteins that emit light. Because the number of cells present in the environment (cell\ndensity) is the determining factor for signaling, bacterial signaling was named quorum sensing. In politics and business, a\nquorum is the minimum number of members required to be present to vote on an issue.\nQuorum sensing uses autoinducers as signaling molecules. Autoinducers are signaling molecules secreted by bacteria to\ncommunicate with other bacteria of the same kind. The secreted autoinducers can be small, hydrophobic molecules such as\nacyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) or larger peptide-based molecules; each type of molecule has a different mode of action.\nWhen AHL enters target bacteria, it binds to transcription factors, which then switch gene expression on or off (Figure\n9.17). The peptide autoinducers stimulate more complicated signaling pathways that include bacterial kinases. The changes\nin bacteria following exposure to autoinducers can be quite extensive. The pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa\nhas 616 different genes that respond to autoinducers.\n388\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 9.17 Autoinducers are small molecules or proteins produced by bacteria that regulate gene expression.\nWhich of the following statements about quorum sensing is false?\na.\nAutoinducers must bind to receptors to turn on transcription of genes responsible for the production of more\nautoinducers.\nb.\nAutoinducers can only act on a different cell. It cannot act on the cell in which it is made.\nc.\nAutoinducers turn on genes that enable the bacteria to form a biofilm.\nd.\nThe receptor stays in the bacterial cell, but the autoinducers diffuse out.\nSome species of bacteria that use quorum sensing form biofilms, complex colonies of bacteria (often containing several\nspecies) that exchange chemical signals to coordinate the release of toxins that will attack the host. Bacterial biofilms\n(Figure 9.18) can sometimes be found on medical equipment; when biofilms invade implants such as hip or knee\nreplacements or heart pacemakers, they can cause life-threatening infections.\nThe ability of certain bacteria to form biofilms has evolved because of a selection of genes that enable cell-cell\ncommunication confers an evolutionary advantage. When bacterial colonies form biofilms, they create barriers that prevent\ntoxins and antibacterial drugs from affecting the population living in the biofilm. As a result, these populations are more\nlikely to survive, even in the presence of antibacterial agents. This often means that bacteria living in biofilms have higher\nfitness than bacteria living on their own.\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\n389\nThink About It\nWhy is signaling in multicellular organisms more complicated than signaling in single-celled organisms such as\nmicrobes?\nFigure 9.18 Cell-cell communication enables these (a) Staphylococcus aureus bacteria to work together to\nform a biofilm inside a hospital patient\u2019s catheter, seen here via scanning electron microscopy. S. aureus is the\nmain cause of hospital-acquired infections. (b) Hawaiian bobtail squid have a symbiotic relationship with the\nbioluminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri. The luminescence makes it difficult to see the squid from below because it\neffectively eliminates its shadow. In return for camouflage, the squid provides food for the bacteria. Free-living V.\nfischeri do not produce luciferase, the enzyme responsible for luminescence, but V. fischeri living in a symbiotic\nrelationship with the squid do. Quorum sensing determines whether the bacteria should produce the luciferase\nenzyme. (credit a: modifications of work by CDC/Janice Carr; credit b: modifications of work by Cliff1066/Flickr)\nFree-living V. fischeri do not luminesce. Why?\na.\nThe squid provides certain nutrients that allow the bacteria to luminesce.\nb.\nThe squid produces the luminescent luciferase enzyme, so bacteria living outside the squid do not luminesce.\nc.\nThe ability to luminesce does not benefit free-living bacteria, so free-living bacteria do not produce\nluciferase.\nd.\nLuciferase is toxic to free-living bacteria, so free-living bacteria do not produce this enzyme.\nResearch on the details of quorum sensing has led to advances in growing bacteria for industrial purposes. Recent\ndiscoveries suggest that it may be possible to exploit bacterial signaling pathways to control bacterial growth; this process\ncould replace or supplement antibiotics that are no longer effective in certain situations.\n390\nChapter 9 | Cell Communication\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nWatch geneticist Bonnie Bassler discuss her discovery (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/bacteria_talk) of quorum sensing\nin biofilm bacteria in squid.\nWhat does bioluminescence show about communication in bacteria?\na.\nBacteria interact by physical signals among a colony.\nb.\nBacterium interact by chemical signals when it is alone.\nc.\nBacterium interact by physical signals when it is alone.\nd.\nBacteria interact by chemical signals among a colony.\nThe first life on our planet consisted of single-celled prokaryotic organisms that had limited interaction with\neach other. While some external signaling occurs between different species of single-celled organisms, the\nmajority of signaling within bacteria and yeasts concerns only other members of the same species. The\nevolution of cellular communication is an absolute necessity for the development of multicellular organisms,\nand this innovation is thought to have required approximately 2.5 billion years to appear in early life forms.\nYeasts are single-celled eukaryotes, and therefore have a nucleus and organelles characteristic of more\ncomplex life forms. Comparisons of the genomes of yeasts, nematode worms, fruit flies, and humans\nillustrate the evolution of increasingly complex signaling systems that allow for the efficient inner workings\nthat keep humans and other complex life forms functioning correctly.\nKinases are a major component of cellular communication, and studies of these enzymes illustrate the\nevolutionary connectivity of different species. Yeasts have 130 types of kinases. More complex organisms\nsuch as nematode worms and fruit flies have 454 and 239 kinases, respectively. Of the 130 kinase types\nin yeast, 97 belong to the 55 subfamilies of kinases that are found in other eukaryotic organisms. The\nonly obvious deficiency seen in yeasts is the complete absence of tyrosine kinases. It is hypothesized that\nphosphorylation of tyrosine residues is needed to control the more sophisticated functions of development,\ndifferentiation, and cellular communication used in multicellular organisms.\nBecause yeasts contain many of the same classes of signaling proteins as humans, these organisms\nare ideal for studying signaling cascades. Yeasts multiply quickly and are much simpler organisms than\nhumans or other multicellular animals. Therefore, the signaling cascades are also simpler and easier to\nstudy, although they contain similar counterparts to human signaling. [2]\nBased on the Evolution Connection, which of the following best describes the evolution of kinases?\na.\nThe tyrosine kinases evolved before yeast diverged from other eukaryotes, but the other fifty-five subfamilies\nof kinases evolved after yeast diverged.\nb.\nFifty-five subfamilies of kinases evolved before yeast diverged from other eukaryotes, but the tyrosine\nkinases evolved after yeast diverged.\nc.\nAll kinases evolved in yeast, but yeast later lost the tyrosine kinases because they do not need them.\nd.\nThe evolution of tyrosine kinases involved in cellular communication occurred about 2.5 billion years ago.\n2.

        "summary": "Single-celled organisms such as yeasts and bacteria use cell signaling to communicate and respond to their environment. In yeasts, which are eukaryotic fungi, mating involves the secretion of a signaling molecule called mating factor that binds to receptors on nearby haploid yeast cells, initiating a signaling cascade involving protein kinases and GTP-binding proteins, leading to mating and the formation of diploid cells. Bacteria, on the other hand, use signaling to monitor conditions like nutrient availability and sometimes communicate through quorum sensing, a process in which they release signaling molecules called autoinducers. When cell density reaches a threshold, autoinducers trigger specific gene expression, enabling behaviors such as bioluminescence in Vibrio fischeri or biofilm formation in species like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Biofilms, which can form on medical devices, provide protection against toxins and antibiotics, enhancing bacterial survival. Evolutionarily, yeast signaling proteins share similarities with those in humans, making them useful for studying signaling pathways, though they lack tyrosine kinases, which are associated with more complex multicellular functions."

Trillions\nof cell divisions subsequently occur in a controlled manner to produce a complex, multicellular human. In other words,\nthat original single cell is the ancestor of every other cell in the body. Once a being is fully grown, cell reproduction is\nstill necessary to repair or regenerate tissues. For example, new blood and skin cells are constantly being produced. All\nmulticellular organisms use cell division for growth, maintenance, and repair of tissues. Cell division is tightly regulated,\nand the occasional failure of regulation can have life-threatening consequences. Single-celled organisms use cell division as\ntheir method of reproduction.\nNot all cells in the body reproduce to repair tissues. Most nerve tissues, for example, are not capable of regeneration. This\nmeans people who have damaged their nerves or nervous system are often left paralyzed.\nHowever, this may change in the future; scientists have discovered a new drug called intracellular signal peptide (ISP),\nwhich helps nerve cells regenerate in rats. It works by blocking an enzyme that causes scar tissue in damaged nerve cells\nallowing the nervous system a chance to repair itself. The full research study is located here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/\n32scar) .\n10.1 | Cell Division\nIn this section, you will explore the following question:\n\u2022\nWhat is the relationship between chromosomes, genes, and traits in prokaryotes and eukaryotes?\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\n403\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nAll organisms, from bacteria to complex animals, must be able to store, retrieve, and transmit genetic information to\ncontinue life. In later chapters, we will explore how a cell\u2019s genetic information encoded in DNA, its genome, is replicated\nand passed to the next generation to direct the production of proteins, determining an organism\u2019s traits. Prokaryotes have\nsingle circular chromosome of DNA, whereas eukaryotes have multiple, linear chromosomes composed of chromatin (DNA\nwrapped around a histone protein) surrounded by a nuclear membrane. Cell division involves both mitosis, the division of\nthe chromosomes, and cytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm. Human somatic cells consist of 46 chromosomes\u201422\npairs of autosomal chromosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes. Prior to mitosis, each chromosome is duplicated to ensure\nthat daughter cells receive the full amount of hereditary material contributed by both parents. The total number of autosomal\nchromosomes is referred to as the diploid (2n) number. (In the next chapter, we will study meiosis, the second type of cell\ndivision in sexually reproducing organisms.)\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined\nin Big Idea 3 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework, as shown in the table.

The\ncell cycle is an orderly sequence of events that describes the stages of a cell\u2019s life from the division of a single parent cell to\nthe production of two new daughter cells. The mechanisms involved in the cell cycle are highly regulated.\nGenomic DNA\nBefore discussing the steps a cell must undertake to replicate, a deeper understanding of the structure and function of a\ncell\u2019s genetic information is necessary. A cell\u2019s DNA, packaged as a double-stranded DNA molecule, is called its genome.\nIn prokaryotes, the genome is composed of a single, double-stranded DNA molecule in the form of a loop or circle (Figure\n10.2). The region in the cell containing this genetic material is called a nucleoid. Some prokaryotes also have smaller loops\nof DNA called plasmids that are not essential for normal growth. Bacteria can exchange these plasmids with other bacteria,\nsometimes receiving beneficial new genes that the recipient can add to their chromosomal DNA. Antibiotic resistance is\none trait that often spreads through a bacterial colony through plasmid exchange.\n404\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 10.2 Prokaryotes, including bacteria and archaea, have a single, circular chromosome located in a central\nregion called the nucleoid.\nIn eukaryotes, the genome consists of several double-stranded linear DNA molecules (Figure 10.3). Each species of\neukaryotes has a characteristic number of chromosomes in the nuclei of its cells. Human body cells have 46 chromosomes,\nwhile human gametes (sperm or eggs) have 23 chromosomes each. A typical body cell, or somatic cell, contains two\nmatched sets of chromosomes, a configuration known as diploid. The letter n is used to represent a single set of\nchromosomes; therefore, a diploid organism is designated 2n. Human cells that contain one set of chromosomes are called\ngametes, or sex cells; these are eggs and sperm, and are designated 1n, or haploid.\nFigure 10.3 There are 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes in a female human somatic cell. The condensed\nchromosomes are viewed within the nucleus (top), removed from a cell in mitosis and spread out on a slide (right),\nand artificially arranged according to length (left); an arrangement like this is called a karyotype. In this image,\nthe chromosomes were exposed to fluorescent stains for differentiation of the different chromosomes. A method of\nstaining called \u201cchromosome painting\u201d employs fluorescent dyes that highlight chromosomes in different colors. (credit:\nNational Human Genome Project/NIH)\nMatched pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism are called homologous (\u201csame knowledge\u201d) chromosomes.\nHomologous chromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide segments called genes in exactly the same\nlocation, or locus. Genes, the functional units of chromosomes, determine specific characteristics by coding for specific\nproteins. Traits are the variations of those characteristics. For example, hair color is a characteristic with traits that are\nblonde, brown, or black.\nEach copy of a homologous pair of chromosomes originates from a different parent; therefore, the genes themselves are\nnot identical. The variation of individuals within a species is due to the specific combination of the genes inherited from\nboth parents. Even a slightly altered sequence of nucleotides within a gene can result in an alternative trait. For example,\nthere are three possible gene sequences on the human chromosome that code for blood type: sequence A, sequence B, and\nsequence O. Because all diploid human cells have two copies of the chromosome that determines blood type, the blood type\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\n405\n(the trait) is determined by which two versions of the marker gene are inherited. It is possible to have two copies of the\nsame gene sequence on both homologous chromosomes, with one on each (for example, AA, BB, or OO), or two different\nsequences, such as AB.\nMinor variations of traits, such as blood type, eye color, and handedness, contribute to the natural variation found within\na species. However, if the entire DNA sequence from any pair of human homologous chromosomes is compared, the\ndifference is less than one percent. The sex chromosomes, X and Y, are the single exception to the rule of homologous\nchromosome uniformity: Other than a small amount of homology that is necessary to accurately produce gametes, the genes\nfound on the X and Y chromosomes are different.\nEukaryotic Chromosomal Structure and Compaction\nIf the DNA from all 46 chromosomes in a human cell nucleus was laid out end to end, it would measure approximately\ntwo meters; however, its diameter would be only 2 nm. Considering that the size of a typical human cell is about 10 \u00b5m\n(100,000 cells lined up to equal one meter), DNA must be tightly packaged to fit in the cell\u2019s nucleus. At the same time, it\nmust also be readily accessible for the genes to be expressed. During some stages of the cell cycle, the long strands of DNA\nare condensed into compact chromosomes. There are a number of ways that chromosomes are compacted.\nIn the first level of compaction, short stretches of the DNA double helix wrap around a core of eight histone proteins\nat regular intervals along the entire length of the chromosome (Figure 10.4). The DNA-histone complex is part of the\nchromatin. Each beadlike histone-DNA complex is called a nucleosome, and DNA connecting the nucleosomes is called\nlinker DNA. A DNA molecule in this form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones, and the\nbeads are about 10 nm in diameter, in contrast with the 2-nm diameter of a DNA double helix. The next level of compaction\noccurs as the nucleosomes and the linker DNA between them are coiled into a 30-nm chromatin fiber. This coiling further\nshortens the chromosome so that it is now about 50 times shorter than the extended form. In the third level of packing,\na variety of fibrous proteins is used to pack the chromatin. These fibrous proteins also ensure that each chromosome in a\nnon-dividing cell occupies a particular area of the nucleus that does not overlap with that of any other chromosome (see the\ntop image in Figure 10.3).\n406\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 10.4 Double-stranded DNA wraps around histone proteins to form nucleosomes that have the appearance of\n\u201cbeads on a string.\u201d The nucleosomes are coiled into a 30-nm chromatin fiber. When a cell undergoes mitosis, the\nchromosomes condense even further.\nDNA replicates in the S phase of interphase. After replication, the chromosomes are composed of two linked sister\nchromatids. When fully compact, the pairs of identically packed chromosomes are bound to each other by cohesin proteins.\nThe connection between the sister chromatids is closest in a region called the centromere. The conjoined sister chromatids,\nwith a diameter of about 1 \u00b5m, are visible under a light microscope. The centromeric region is highly condensed and thus\nwill appear as a constricted area.\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\n407\nThis animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/Packaged_DNA) illustrates the different levels of chromosome packing.\nWhy is nucleosome formation required for the packaging of DNA?\na.\nNucleosome formation results in compaction of the DNA to form chromatin.\nb.\nNucleosome formation results in DNA synthesis.\nc.\nNucleosome formation decreases the number of introns in DNA.\nd.\nNucleosome formation increases the number of introns in the DNA.\nThink About It\nWhat is the relationship between a genome and chromosomes?\n10.2 | The Cell Cycle\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat processes occur during the three stages of interphase?\n\u2022\nHow do the chromosomes behave during the mitotic phase?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe cell cycle describes an orderly sequence of events that are highly regulated.

Interphase is divided into three phases: Gap\n1 (G1), DNA synthesis (S), and Gap 2 (G2). Interphase represents the portion of the cell cycle between nuclear divisions.\nDuring this phase, preparations are made for division that include growth, duplication of most cellular contents, and\nreplication of DNA. The cell\u2019s DNA is replicated during the S stage. (We will study the details of DNA replication in the\nchapter on DNA structure and function.) Following the G2 stage of interphase, the cell begins mitosis, the process of active\ndivision by which duplicated chromosomes (chromatids) attach to spindle fibers, align themselves along the equator of the\ncell, and then separate from each other.\nFollowing mitosis, the cell undergoes cytokinesis, the splitting of the parent cell into two daughter cells, complete with a\nfull complement of genetic material.

The cell cycle has two major phases: interphase and\nthe mitotic phase (Figure 10.5). During interphase, the cell grows and DNA is replicated. During the mitotic phase, the\nreplicated DNA and cytoplasmic contents are separated, and the cell divides.\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\n409\nFigure 10.5 The cell cycle consists of interphase and the mitotic phase. During interphase, the cell grows and the\nnuclear DNA is duplicated. Interphase is followed by the mitotic phase. During the mitotic phase, the duplicated\nchromosomes are segregated and distributed into daughter nuclei. The cytoplasm is usually divided as well, resulting\nin two daughter cells.\nInterphase\nDuring interphase, the cell undergoes normal growth processes while also preparing for cell division. In order for a cell\nto move from interphase into the mitotic phase, many internal and external conditions must be met. The three stages of\ninterphase are called G1, S, and G2.\nG1 Phase (First Gap)\nThe first stage of interphase is called the G1 phase (first gap) because, from a microscopic aspect, little change is visible.\nHowever, during the G1 stage, the cell is quite active at the biochemical level. The cell is accumulating the building blocks\nof chromosomal DNA and the associated proteins as well as accumulating sufficient energy reserves to complete the task\nof replicating each chromosome in the nucleus.\nS Phase (Synthesis of DNA)\nThroughout interphase, nuclear DNA remains in a semi-condensed chromatin configuration. In the S phase, DNA\nreplication can proceed through the mechanisms that result in the formation of identical pairs of DNA molecules\u2014sister\nchromatids\u2014that are firmly attached to the centromeric region. The centrosome is duplicated during the S phase. The two\ncentrosomes will give rise to the mitotic spindle, the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during\nmitosis. At the center of each animal cell, the centrosomes of animal cells are associated with a pair of rod-like objects, the\ncentrioles, which are at right angles to each other. Centrioles help organize cell division. Centrioles are not present in the\ncentrosomes of other eukaryotic species, such as plants and most fungi.\nG2 Phase (Second Gap)\nIn the G2 phase, the cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes proteins necessary for chromosome manipulation.\nSome cell organelles are duplicated, and the cytoskeleton is dismantled to provide resources for the mitotic phase. There\nmay be additional cell growth during G2. The final preparations for the mitotic phase must be completed before the cell is\nable to enter the first stage of mitosis.\nThe Mitotic Phase\nThe mitotic phase is a multistep process during which the duplicated chromosomes are aligned, separated, and move into\ntwo new, identical daughter cells.

The other\ntwo purposes are growth and repair.\nFigure 10.6\n412\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nWhich of the following statements best describes the relationship between mitosis and asexual reproduction?\na.\nMitosis is a process that can result in asexual reproduction.\nb.\nMitosis is a process that always results in asexual reproduction.\nc.\nAsexual reproduction is a process that always results in mitosis.\nd.\nAsexual reproduction is a process that can result in mitosis.\nFigure 10.7 Karyokinesis (or mitosis) is divided into five stages\u2014prophase, prometaphase, metaphase,\nanaphase, and telophase. The pictures at the bottom were taken by fluorescence microscopy (hence, the black\nbackground) of cells artificially stained by fluorescent dyes: blue fluorescence indicates DNA (chromosomes) and\ngreen fluorescence indicates microtubules (spindle apparatus).

The nucleolus disappears (disperses). The centrosomes begin to move to opposite poles of the\ncell. Microtubules that will form the mitotic spindle extend between the centrosomes, pushing them farther apart as the\nmicrotubule fibers lengthen. The sister chromatids begin to coil more tightly with the aid of condensin proteins and become\nvisible under a light microscope.\nDuring prometaphase, the \u201cfirst change phase,\u201d many processes that were begun in prophase continue to advance. The\nremnants of the nuclear envelope fragment. The mitotic spindle continues to develop as more microtubules assemble and\nstretch across the length of the former nuclear area. Chromosomes become more condensed and discrete. Each sister\nchromatid develops a protein structure called a kinetochore in the centromeric region (Figure 10.8). The proteins of\nthe kinetochore attract and bind mitotic spindle microtubules. As the spindle microtubules extend from the centrosomes,\nsome of these microtubules come into contact with and firmly bind to the kinetochores. Once a mitotic fiber attaches\nto a chromosome, the chromosome will be oriented until the kinetochores of sister chromatids face the opposite poles.\nEventually, all the sister chromatids will be attached via their kinetochores to microtubules from opposing poles. Spindle\nmicrotubules that do not engage the chromosomes are called polar microtubules. These microtubules overlap each other\nmidway between the two poles and contribute to cell elongation. Astral microtubules are located near the poles, aid in\nspindle orientation, and are required for the regulation of mitosis.\nFigure 10.8 During prometaphase, mitotic spindle microtubules from opposite poles attach to each sister chromatid at\nthe kinetochore. In anaphase, the connection between the sister chromatids breaks down, and the microtubules pull\nthe chromosomes toward opposite poles.\nDuring metaphase, the \u201cchange phase,\u201d all the chromosomes are aligned in a plane called the metaphase plate, or the\nequatorial plane, midway between the two poles of the cell. The sister chromatids are still tightly attached to each other by\ncohesin proteins. At this time, the chromosomes are maximally condensed.\nDuring anaphase, the \u201cupward phase,\u201d the cohesin proteins degrade, and the sister chromatids separate at the centromere.\nEach chromatid, now called a chromosome, is pulled rapidly toward the centrosome to which its microtubule is attached.\nThe cell becomes visibly elongated (oval shaped) as the polar microtubules slide against each other at the metaphase plate\nwhere they overlap.\nDuring telophase, the \u201cdistance phase,\u201d the chromosomes reach the opposite poles and begin to decondense (unravel),\nrelaxing into a chromatin configuration. The mitotic spindles are depolymerized into tubulin monomers that will be\nused to assemble cytoskeletal components for each daughter cell. Nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes, and\nnucleosomes appear within the nuclear area.\nCytokinesis\nCytokinesis, or \u201ccell motion,\u201d is the second main stage of the mitotic phase, during which cell division is completed via\nthe physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells. Division is not complete until the cell\ncomponents have been apportioned and completely separated into the two daughter cells. Although the stages of mitosis are\nsimilar for most eukaryotes, the process of cytokinesis is quite different for eukaryotes that have cell walls, such as plant\ncells.\nIn cells such as animal cells that lack cell walls, cytokinesis starts during late anaphase. A contractile ring composed of actin\nfilaments forms just inside the plasma membrane at the former metaphase plate. The actin filaments pull the equator of the\n414\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\ncell inward, forming a fissure. This fissure, or \u201ccrack,\u201d is called the cleavage furrow. The furrow deepens as the actin ring\ncontracts, and eventually the membrane is cleaved in two (Figure 10.9).\nIn plant cells, a new cell wall must form between the daughter cells. During interphase, the Golgi apparatus accumulates\nenzymes, structural proteins, and glucose molecules prior to breaking into vesicles and dispersing throughout the dividing\ncell. During telophase, these Golgi vesicles are transported on microtubules to form a phragmoplast (a vesicular structure) at\nthe metaphase plate. There, the vesicles fuse and coalesce from the center toward the cell walls; this structure is called a cell\nplate. As more vesicles fuse, the cell plate enlarges until it merges with the cell walls at the periphery of the cell. Enzymes\nuse the glucose that has accumulated between the membrane layers to build a new cell wall. The Golgi membranes become\nparts of the plasma membrane on either side of the new cell wall (Figure 10.9).\nFigure 10.9 During cytokinesis in animal cells, a ring of actin filaments forms at the metaphase plate. The ring\ncontracts, forming a cleavage furrow, which divides the cell in two. In plant cells, Golgi vesicles coalesce at the former\nmetaphase plate, forming a phragmoplast. A cell plate formed by the fusion of the vesicles of the phragmoplast grows\nfrom the center toward the cell walls, and the membranes of the vesicles fuse to form a plasma membrane that divides\nthe cell in two.\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\n415\nActivity\n\u2022\nUse a set of pipe cleaners (or other materials as directed by your teacher) that you can use to model\nchromosomes during mitosis and meiosis:\n1.\nEach of the pipe cleaners represents a single, unreplicated chromosome. Each chromosome\nshould differ in size, as they do in most organisms. Assume that your dividing cell contains 3\nchromosomes: numbered chromosome 1, 2, and 3.\n2.\nUsing both members of each homologous pair for chromosomes 1\u20133, model how the\nchromosomes would appear in a cell that had just finished the S phase of the cell cycle. Once\nyour teacher has approved your model, have one member of your group document the model by\nphotographing or drawing it.\n3.\nNow, repeat step 2 but show the cell at metaphase during mitosis.\n4.\nFinally, model the two daughter cells that will result from mitosis. Again, have one member of your\ngroup document the model.\n5.\nRepeat steps 2\u20135 for both meiosis I and meiosis II. Remember that you should have four daughter\ncells at the end of meiosis II. Also remember to ask your teacher for approval and document your\nmodel before moving on to the next phase of meiosis.\n6.\nExchange/ copy all of the drawings or photographs that your group took of your models. As a\ngroup or individually (as directed by your teacher) create a report to turn in that labels and explain\neach picture of your model.\n\u2022\nAn organism\u2019s ploidy count is the total number of chromosome sets contained in each body cell. Most\norganisms have a ploidy level of 2, meaning that they have two sets of chromosomes due to presence\nof homologous pairs. However, some plants are multiploid, meaning they can have ploidy levels greater\nthan 2. The table shows possible multiploid levels of some common crop plants.\nCommon name\nMultiploid chromosome count\nNormal chromosome count\nBananas\n33\n11\nPotatoes\n48\n12\nWheat\n42\n7\nSugar cane\n80\n10\nAnalyze the data with a partner of in a group as directed by your teacher. On a separate sheet of paper,\nanswer the following questions.\na.\nHow does the multiploid count of the crop plants relate to their normal chromosome count?\nb.\nExplain the basis for the relationship you described in part a, in terms of what occurs to chromosomes\nduring replication and meiosis.\nc.\nGive one additional example of a possible multiploid chromosome count for each species in the table\nabove.\nExercise 10.1\nA. A comparison of the relative time intervals of mitotic stages can be made by completing the task described. In\nevaluating each time interval, the problem suggests that you assume that the length of time to complete one cell cycle\nis 24 hours. How can that assumption be tested?\n416\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nSuppose that you have a growth chamber in which roots of a newly germinated plant can be examined visually with\na lens that provides a magnification from which lengths can be determined with a precision of \u00b1 0.05 mm. The field\nof view can be rotated so that measurements can be made of both the length and diameter of the growing tip. A large\nnumber of growing roots can be studied. Tips can be sampled, sectioned, and examined microscopically with a 25\u00d7\nmagnification so that estimates of the diameter and length of cells can be made.\nCells in the growing tip of the root rapidly undergo mitosis, just as the whitefish blastula described in Figure 10.10.\nWith increasing distance from the growing tip, the rate at which mitosis occurs slows until tissue is reached in which\nthe initiation of the cell cycle is delayed.\nA. Describe a sequence of measurements that could be used to test the assumption that the cell cycle, once started, has\na total time interval of 24 hours. Hint: Rather than counting cells, it might be useful to measure the length of the root\ntip and the average length of a cell.\nB. Using the data obtained from your measurements described in part A, how can the rate of cell division be calculated?\nAn experiment that is perhaps similar to one you have proposed was conducted previously (Beemster and Baxter,\n1998), and the results are shown in the table.\nDistance (mm)\nPer hour\n0\n0.035 \u00b1 0.01\n0.1\n0.047 \u00b1 0.005\n0.2\n0.044 \u00b1 0.01\n0.3\n0.039 \u00b1 0.01\n0.4\n0.042 \u00b1 0.01\n0.5\n0.031 \u00b1 0.005\nTable 10.1\nC. Using these data, estimate the length of time of the cell cycle, including an estimate of precision by calculating the\nstandard deviation.\nGrowth factors are signals that initiate cell division in eukaryotes. (The data in the table above show that cells in\nthe plant root less than a mm from the root tip are showing a reduction of growth rate.) The interaction of two plant\nhormones, auxin and brassinosteroids, have been shown [Chaiwanon and Wang, Cell, 164(6), 1257, 2016] to regulate\ncell division in root tips. Auxin concentrations are higher near the root tip and decrease with distance from the tip.\nBrassinosteroids decrease in concentration near the root tip. Auxin is actively transported between cells, whereas\nbrassinosteroids have limited transport between cells.\nD. Based on these data and the observed distribution of brassinosteroids and auxin in the growing root, predict a\nmechanism for their interaction and justify the claim that brassinosteroid synthesis is negatively regulated by auxin\ntransported to the cell, and that auxin is positively regulated and amplified.\nThink About It\nChemotherapy drugs such as vincristine and colchicines disrupt mitosis by binding to tubulin (the subunit of\nmicrotubules) and interfering with microtubule assembly and disassembly. What mitotic structure is targeted by these\ndrugs, and what effect would this have on cell division?\nG0 Phase\nNot all cells adhere to the classic cell cycle pattern in which a newly formed daughter cell immediately enters the\npreparatory phases of interphase, closely followed by the mitotic phase. Cells in G0 phase are not actively preparing to\ndivide. The cell is in a quiescent (inactive) stage that occurs when cells exit the cell cycle. Some cells enter G0 temporarily\nuntil an external signal triggers the onset of G1. Other cells that never or rarely divide, such as mature cardiac muscle and\nnerve cells, remain in G0 permanently.\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\n417\nDetermine the Time Spent in Cell Cycle Stages\nProblem: How long does a cell spend in interphase compared to each stage of mitosis?\nBackground: A prepared microscope slide of blastula cross-sections will show cells arrested in various stages of the\ncell cycle. It is not visually possible to separate the stages of interphase from each other, but the mitotic stages are\nreadily identifiable. If 100 cells are examined, the number of cells in each identifiable cell cycle stage will give an\nestimate of the time it takes for the cell to complete that stage.\nProblem Statement: Given the events included in all of interphase and those that take place in each stage of mitosis,\nestimate the length of each stage based on a 24-hour cell cycle. Before proceeding, state your hypothesis.\nTest your hypothesis: Test your hypothesis by doing the following:\n1.\nPlace a fixed and stained microscope slide of whitefish blastula cross-sections under the scanning objective of a\nlight microscope.\n2.\nLocate and focus on one of the sections using the scanning objective of your microscope. Notice that the section\nis a circle composed of dozens of closely packed individual cells.\n3.\nSwitch to the low-power objective and refocus. With this objective, individual cells are visible.\n4.\nSwitch to the high-power objective and slowly move the slide left to right, and up and down to view all the cells\nin the section (Figure 10.10). As you scan, you will notice that most of the cells are not undergoing mitosis but\nare in the interphase period of the cell cycle.\nFigure 10.10 Slowly scan whitefish blastula cells with the high-power objective as illustrated in image (a)\nto identify their mitotic stage.

        "summary": "The cell cycle is a regulated sequence of events in eukaryotic cells that leads to the production of two genetically identical daughter cells and consists of two major phases: interphase and the mitotic phase. Interphase, which includes the G1, S, and G2 stages, involves cell growth, duplication of cellular components, and DNA replication, with G1 focusing on resource accumulation, S on DNA and centrosome duplication, and G2 on final preparations for division. The mitotic phase comprises karyokinesis (mitosis) and cytokinesis; mitosis is divided into prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, during which chromosomes condense, align, separate, and decondense while new nuclei form. Cytokinesis physically separates the cytoplasm, via a cleavage furrow in animal cells or a cell plate in plant cells, completing cell division. Some cells enter a non-dividing G0 phase temporarily or permanently. This cycle ensures proper growth, replication, and distribution of genetic material to maintain continuity of life."

In humans, the frequency of cell\nturnover ranges from a few hours in early embryonic development, to an average of two to five days for epithelial cells, and\nto an entire human lifetime spent in G0 by specialized cells, such as cortical neurons or cardiac muscle cells. There is also\nvariation in the time that a cell spends in each phase of the cell cycle. When fast-dividing mammalian cells are grown in\nculture (outside the body under optimal growing conditions), the length of the cycle is about 24 hours. In rapidly dividing\nhuman cells with a 24-hour cell cycle, the G1 phase lasts approximately nine hours, the S phase lasts 10 hours, the G2 phase\nlasts about four and one-half hours, and the M phase lasts approximately one-half hour. In early embryos of fruit flies, the\ncell cycle is completed in about eight minutes. The timing of events in the cell cycle is controlled by mechanisms that are\nboth internal and external to the cell.\nRegulation of the Cell Cycle by External Events\nBoth the initiation and inhibition of cell division are triggered by events external to the cell when it is about to begin the\nreplication process. An event may be as simple as the death of a nearby cell or as sweeping as the release of growth-\npromoting hormones, such as human growth hormone (HGH). A lack of HGH can inhibit cell division, resulting in\ndwarfism, whereas too much HGH can result in gigantism. Crowding of cells can also inhibit cell division. Another factor\nthat can initiate cell division is the size of the cell; as a cell grows, it becomes inefficient due to its decreasing surface-to-\nvolume ratio. The solution to this problem is to divide.\nWhatever the source of the message, the cell receives the signal, and a series of events within the cell allows it to proceed\ninto interphase. Moving forward from this initiation point, every parameter required during each cell cycle phase must be\nmet or the cycle cannot progress.\nRegulation at Internal Checkpoints\nIt is essential that the daughter cells produced be exact duplicates of the parent cell. Mistakes in the duplication or\ndistribution of the chromosomes lead to mutations that may be passed forward to every new cell produced from an abnormal\ncell. To prevent a compromised cell from continuing to divide, there are internal control mechanisms that operate at three\nmain cell cycle checkpoints. A checkpoint is one of several points in the eukaryotic cell cycle at which the progression of\na cell to the next stage in the cycle can be halted until conditions are favorable. These checkpoints occur near the end of G1,\nat the G2/M transition, and during metaphase (Figure 10.11).\n420\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 10.11 The cell cycle is controlled at three checkpoints. The integrity of the DNA is assessed at the G1\ncheckpoint. Proper chromosome duplication is assessed at the G2 checkpoint. Attachment of each kinetochore to a\nspindle fiber is assessed at the M checkpoint.\nThe G1 Checkpoint\nThe G1 checkpoint determines whether all conditions are favorable for cell division to proceed. The G1 checkpoint, also\ncalled the restriction point (in yeast), is a point at which the cell commits to the cell division process. External influences,\nsuch as growth factors, play a large role in carrying the cell past the G1 checkpoint. In addition to adequate reserves and cell\nsize, there is a check for genomic DNA damage at the G1 checkpoint. A cell that does not meet all the requirements will not\nbe allowed to progress into the S phase. The cell can halt the cycle and attempt to remedy the problematic condition, or the\ncell can advance into G0 and await further signals when conditions improve.\nThe G2 Checkpoint\nThe G2 checkpoint bars entry into the mitotic phase if certain conditions are not met. As at the G1 checkpoint, cell size\nand protein reserves are assessed. However, the most important role of the G2 checkpoint is to ensure that all of the\nchromosomes have been replicated and that the replicated DNA is not damaged. If the checkpoint mechanisms detect\nproblems with the DNA, the cell cycle is halted, and the cell attempts to either complete DNA replication or repair the\ndamaged DNA.\nThe M Checkpoint\nThe M checkpoint occurs near the end of the metaphase stage of karyokinesis. The M checkpoint is also known as\nthe spindle checkpoint, because it determines whether all the sister chromatids are correctly attached to the spindle\nmicrotubules. Because the separation of the sister chromatids during anaphase is an irreversible step, the cycle will not\nproceed until the kinetochores of each pair of sister chromatids are firmly anchored to at least two spindle fibers arising\nfrom opposite poles of the cell.\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\n421\nWatch what occurs at the G1, G2, and M checkpoints by visiting this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/\ncell_checkpnts) to see an animation of the cell cycle.\nDown Syndrome is a genetic, developmental condition caused by nondisjunction of chromosome 21 during meiosis.\nExplain how a problem with the spindle checkpoint can cause this to occur in the cell.\na.\nFailure in spindle checkpoint results in the formation of one gamete cell with two extra chromosomes and\nanother gamete cell lacking chromosomes.\nb.\nFailure in spindle checkpoint yields the same number of chromosomes in each gamete cell.\nc.\nFailure in spindle checkpoint will form two gamete cells without any chromosomes.\nd.\nFailure in spindle checkpoint results in the formation of one gamete cell with an extra chromosome and\nanother gamete cell lacking a chromosome.\nRegulator Molecules of the Cell Cycle\nIn addition to the internally controlled checkpoints, there are two groups of intracellular molecules that regulate the cell\ncycle. These regulatory molecules either promote progress of the cell to the next phase (positive regulation) or halt the cycle\n(negative regulation). Regulator molecules may act individually, or they can influence the activity or production of other\nregulatory proteins. Therefore, the failure of a single regulator may have almost no effect on the cell cycle, especially if\nmore than one mechanism controls the same event. Conversely, the effect of a deficient or non-functioning regulator can be\nwide-ranging and possibly fatal to the cell if multiple processes are affected.\nPositive Regulation of the Cell Cycle\nTwo groups of proteins, called cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), are responsible for the progress of the cell\nthrough the various checkpoints. The levels of the four cyclin proteins fluctuate throughout the cell cycle in a predictable\npattern (Figure 10.12). Increases in the concentration of cyclin proteins are triggered by both external and internal signals.\nAfter the cell moves to the next stage of the cell cycle, the cyclins that were active in the previous stage are degraded.\n422\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 10.12 The concentrations of cyclin proteins change throughout the cell cycle. There is a direct correlation\nbetween cyclin accumulation and the three major cell cycle checkpoints. Also note the sharp decline of cyclin levels\nfollowing each checkpoint (the transition between phases of the cell cycle), as cyclin is degraded by cytoplasmic\nenzymes. (credit: modification of work by \"WikiMiMa\"/Wikimedia Commons)\nCyclins regulate the cell cycle only when they are tightly bound to Cdks. To be fully active, the Cdk/cyclin complex must\nalso be phosphorylated in specific locations. Like all kinases, Cdks are enzymes (kinases) that phosphorylate other proteins.\nPhosphorylation activates the protein by changing its shape. The proteins phosphorylated by Cdks are involved in advancing\nthe cell to the next phase. (Figure 10.13). The levels of Cdk proteins are relatively stable throughout the cell cycle; however,\nthe concentrations of cyclin fluctuate and determine when Cdk/cyclin complexes form. The different cyclins and Cdks bind\nat specific points in the cell cycle and thus regulate different checkpoints.\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\n423\nFigure 10.13 Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are protein kinases that, when fully activated, can phosphorylate and\nthus activate other proteins that advance the cell cycle past a checkpoint. To become fully activated, a Cdk must bind\nto a cyclin protein and then be phosphorylated by another kinase.\nSince the cyclic fluctuations of cyclin levels are based on the timing of the cell cycle and not on specific events, regulation\nof the cell cycle usually occurs by either the Cdk molecules alone or the Cdk/cyclin complexes. Without a specific\nconcentration of fully activated cyclin/Cdk complexes, the cell cycle cannot proceed through the checkpoints.\nAlthough the cyclins are the main regulatory molecules that determine the forward momentum of the cell cycle, there\nare several other mechanisms that fine-tune the progress of the cycle with negative, rather than positive, effects. These\nmechanisms essentially block the progression of the cell cycle until problematic conditions are resolved. Molecules that\nprevent the full activation of Cdks are called Cdk inhibitors. Many of these inhibitor molecules directly or indirectly monitor\na particular cell cycle event. The block placed on Cdks by inhibitor molecules will not be removed until the specific event\nthat the inhibitor monitors is completed.\n424\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nNegative Regulation of the Cell Cycle\nThe second group of cell cycle regulatory molecules are negative regulators. Negative regulators halt the cell cycle.\nRemember that in positive regulation, active molecules cause the cycle to progress.\nThe best understood negative regulatory molecules are retinoblastoma protein (Rb), p53, and p21. Retinoblastoma\nproteins are a group of tumor-suppressor proteins common in many cells. The 53 and 21 designations refer to the functional\nmolecular masses of the proteins (p) in kilodaltons. Much of what is known about cell cycle regulation comes from research\nconducted with cells that have lost regulatory control. All three of these regulatory proteins were discovered to be damaged\nor non-functional in cells that had begun to replicate uncontrollably (became cancerous). In each case, the main cause of the\nunchecked progress through the cell cycle was a faulty copy of the regulatory protein.\nRb, p53, and p21 act primarily at the G1 checkpoint. p53 is a multi-functional protein that has a major impact on the\ncommitment of a cell to division because it acts when there is damaged DNA in cells that are undergoing the preparatory\nprocesses during G1. If damaged DNA is detected, p53 halts the cell cycle and recruits enzymes to repair the DNA. If the\nDNA cannot be repaired, p53 can trigger apoptosis, or cell death, to prevent the duplication of damaged chromosomes.\nAs p53 levels rise, the production of p21 is triggered. p21 enforces the halt in the cycle dictated by p53 by binding to\nand inhibiting the activity of the Cdk/cyclin complexes. As a cell is exposed to more stress, higher levels of p53 and p21\naccumulate, making it less likely that the cell will move into the S phase.\nRb exerts its regulatory influence on other positive regulator proteins. Chiefly, Rb monitors cell size. In the active,\ndephosphorylated state, Rb binds to proteins called transcription factors, most commonly, E2F (Figure 10.14). Transcription\nfactors \u201cturn on\u201d specific genes, allowing the production of proteins encoded by that gene. When Rb is bound to E2F,\nproduction of proteins necessary for the G1/S transition is blocked. As the cell increases in size, Rb is slowly phosphorylated\nuntil it becomes inactivated. Rb releases E2F, which can now turn on the gene that produces the transition protein, and this\nparticular block is removed. For the cell to move past each of the checkpoints, all positive regulators must be \u201cturned on,\u201d\nand all negative regulators must be \u201cturned off.\u201d\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\n425\nFigure 10.14 Rb halts the cell cycle and releases its hold in response to cell growth.\nRb and other proteins that negatively regulate the cell cycle are sometimes called tumor supressors.

        "summary": "The control of the cell cycle involves both internal and external mechanisms that regulate progression through specific checkpoints to ensure proper cell division. External factors such as growth hormones, cell crowding, and cell size can initiate or inhibit division, while internal checkpoints at G1, G2, and M phases verify DNA integrity, chromosome replication, and proper spindle fiber attachment before progression. Positive regulatory molecules like cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) drive the cycle forward when activated, with cyclin levels fluctuating at key stages. Negative regulators such as Rb, p53, and p21 halt the cycle under unfavorable conditions, particularly at the G1 checkpoint, to prevent replication of damaged DNA, often by inhibiting Cdk activity or controlling transcription factors. Faulty regulation, including damaged versions of these proteins, can lead to uncontrolled cell division."

The\nloss of control begins with a change in the DNA sequence of a gene that codes for one of the regulatory molecules. Faulty\ninstructions lead to a protein that does not function as it should. One culprit that has been identified is the p53 protein\n(coded for by the p53 gene), a major regulator at the G1 checkpoint. Normally, p53 proteins monitor DNA. If they find cells\nwith damaged DNA, p53 will trigger repair mechanisms or destroy the cells, thus suppressing the formation of a tumor.\nHowever, mutations in p53 can result in abnormal p53 proteins that fail to stop cell division if the cell\u2019s DNA is damaged.\nThis results in an increased number of mutations, leading to abnormal daughter cells. Eventually, all checkpoints in the cell\nbecome nonfunctional, and the abnormal cells can crowd out normal cells.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined\nin Big Idea 3 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework, as shown in the table.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 2.32][APLO 2.34][APLO 3.6][APLO 3.7][APLO 3.8][APLO 4.6][APLO 4.14][APLO 4.22]\nCancer comprises many different diseases caused by a common mechanism: uncontrolled cell growth. Despite the\nredundancy and overlapping levels of cell cycle control, errors do occur. One of the critical processes monitored by the\ncell cycle checkpoint surveillance mechanism is the proper replication of DNA during the S phase. Even when all of\nthe cell cycle controls are fully functional, a small percentage of replication errors (mutations) will be passed on to the\ndaughter cells. If changes to the DNA nucleotide sequence occur within a coding portion of a gene and are not corrected,\na gene mutation results. All cancers start when a gene mutation gives rise to a faulty protein that plays a key role in\ncell reproduction. The change in the cell that results from the malformed protein may be minor: perhaps a slight delay in\nthe binding of Cdk to cyclin or an Rb protein that detaches from its target DNA while still phosphorylated. Even minor\nmistakes, however, may allow subsequent mistakes to occur more readily. Over and over, small uncorrected errors are\npassed from the parent cell to the daughter cells and amplified as each generation produces more non-functional proteins\nfrom uncorrected DNA damage. Eventually, the pace of the cell cycle speeds up as the effectiveness of the control and\nrepair mechanisms decreases. Uncontrolled growth of the mutated cells outpaces the growth of normal cells in the area, and\na tumor (\u201c-oma\u201d) can result.\nProto-oncogenes\nThe genes that code for the positive cell cycle regulators are called proto-oncogenes. Proto-oncogenes are normal genes\nthat, when mutated in certain ways, become oncogenes, genes that cause a cell to become cancerous. Consider what might\nhappen to the cell cycle in a cell with a recently acquired oncogene. In most instances, the alteration of the DNA sequence\nwill result in a less functional (or non-functional) protein. The result is detrimental to the cell and will likely prevent the cell\nfrom completing the cell cycle; however, the organism is not harmed because the mutation will not be carried forward. If a\ncell cannot reproduce, the mutation is not propagated and the damage is minimal. Occasionally, however, a gene mutation\ncauses a change that increases the activity of a positive regulator. For example, a mutation that allows Cdk to be activated\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\n427\nwithout being partnered with cyclin could push the cell cycle past a checkpoint before all of the required conditions are\nmet. If the resulting daughter cells are too damaged to undergo further cell divisions, the mutation would not be propagated\nand no harm would come to the organism. However, if the atypical daughter cells are able to undergo further cell divisions,\nsubsequent generations of cells will probably accumulate even more mutations, some possibly in additional genes that\nregulate the cell cycle.\nThe Cdk gene in the above example is only one of many genes that are considered proto-oncogenes. In addition to the\ncell cycle regulatory proteins, any protein that influences the cycle can be altered in such a way as to override cell cycle\ncheckpoints. An oncogene is any gene that, when altered, leads to an increase in the rate of cell cycle progression.\nTumor Suppressor Genes\nLike proto-oncogenes, many of the negative cell cycle regulatory proteins were discovered in cells that had become\ncancerous. Tumor suppressor genes are segments of DNA that code for negative regulator proteins, the type of regulators\nthat, when activated, can prevent the cell from undergoing uncontrolled division. The collective function of the best-\nunderstood tumor suppressor gene proteins, Rb, p53, and p21, is to put up a roadblock to cell cycle progression until certain\nevents are completed. A cell that carries a mutated form of a negative regulator might not be able to halt the cell cycle if\nthere is a problem. Tumor suppressors are similar to brakes in a vehicle: Malfunctioning brakes can contribute to a car crash.\nMutated p53 genes have been identified in more than one-half of all human tumor cells. This discovery is not surprising in\nlight of the multiple roles that the p53 protein plays at the G1 checkpoint. A cell with a faulty p53 may fail to detect errors\npresent in the genomic DNA (Figure 10.15). Even if a partially functional p53 does identify the mutations, it may no longer\nbe able to signal the necessary DNA repair enzymes. Either way, damaged DNA will remain uncorrected. At this point, a\nfunctional p53 will deem the cell unsalvageable and trigger programmed cell death (apoptosis). The damaged version of\np53 found in cancer cells, however, cannot trigger apoptosis.\n428\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 10.15 The role of normal p53 is to monitor DNA and the supply of oxygen (hypoxia is a condition of reduced\noxygen supply). If damage is detected, p53 triggers repair mechanisms. If repairs are unsuccessful, p53 signals\napoptosis. A cell with an abnormal p53 protein cannot repair damaged DNA and thus cannot signal apoptosis.\nCells with abnormal p53 can become cancerous. (credit: modification of work by Thierry Soussi)\nHuman papillomavirus can cause cervical cancer. The virus encodes E6, a protein that binds p53. Based on this fact\nand what you know about p53, what effect do you think E6 binding has on p53 activity?\na.\nE6 activates p53\nb.\nE6 inactivates p53\nc.\nE6 mutates p53\nd.\nE6 binding marks p53 for degradation\nThe loss of p53 function has other repercussions for the cell cycle. Mutated p53 might lose its ability to trigger p21\nproduction. Without adequate levels of p21, there is no effective block on Cdk activation. Essentially, without a fully\nfunctional p53, the G1 checkpoint is severely compromised and the cell proceeds directly from G1 to S regardless of internal\nand external conditions. At the completion of this shortened cell cycle, two daughter cells are produced that have inherited\nthe mutated p53 gene. Given the non-optimal conditions under which the parent cell reproduced, it is likely that the daughter\ncells will have acquired other mutations in addition to the faulty tumor suppressor gene. Cells such as these daughter cells\nquickly accumulate both oncogenes and non-functional tumor suppressor genes. Again, the result is tumor growth.\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\n429\nGo to this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/cancer) to watch an animation of how cancer results from errors in the\ncell cycle.\nTreating cancer can be described as a fight against natural biologic processes.

For unicellular organisms, cell division is the only method to\nproduce new individuals. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the outcome of cell reproduction is a pair of daughter\ncells that are genetically identical to the parent cell. In unicellular organisms, daughter cells are individuals.\nTo achieve the outcome of cloned offspring, certain steps are essential. The genomic DNA must be replicated and then\nallocated into the daughter cells; the cytoplasmic contents must also be divided to give both new cells the machinery to\nsustain life. In bacterial cells, the genome consists of a single, circular DNA chromosome; therefore, the process of cell\ndivision is simplified. Karyokinesis is unnecessary because there is no nucleus and thus no need to direct one copy of the\nmultiple chromosomes into each daughter cell. This type of cell division is called binary (prokaryotic) fission.\nBinary Fission\nDue to the relative simplicity of the prokaryotes, the cell division process, called binary fission, is a less complicated and\nmuch more rapid process than cell division in eukaryotes. The single, circular DNA chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed\nin a nucleus, but instead occupies a specific location, the nucleoid, within the cell (Figure 10.2). Although the DNA of the\nnucleoid is associated with proteins that aid in packaging the molecule into a compact size, there are no histone proteins and\nthus no nucleosomes in prokaryotes. The packing proteins of bacteria are, however, related to the cohesin and condensin\nproteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes.\n430\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\n",
        "summary": "Cancer results from uncontrolled cell division caused by failures in the mechanisms regulating the cell cycle, often beginning with mutations in genes that code for key regulatory proteins. For example, mutations in the p53 gene can produce defective proteins unable to halt the cycle or trigger DNA repair or apoptosis, allowing cells with damaged DNA to proliferate. Over time, small uncorrected errors accumulate, control mechanisms weaken, and abnormal cells multiply, potentially forming tumors. Genes that code for positive cell cycle regulators are called proto-oncogenes and can become oncogenes when mutations increase their activity, pushing cells past checkpoints improperly. Negative regulators, encoded by tumor suppressor genes such as Rb, p53, and p21, act as brakes to prevent uncontrolled division; mutations in these genes remove these brakes. A combination of oncogene activation and tumor suppressor loss accelerates the cell cycle, allowing damaged cells to reproduce unchecked and develop into cancer."

The starting point of\nreplication, the origin, is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane (Figure 10.16). Replication\nof the DNA is bidirectional, moving away from the origin on both strands of the loop simultaneously. As the new double\nstrands are formed, each origin point moves away from the cell wall attachment toward the opposite ends of the cell. As\nthe cell elongates, the growing membrane aids in the transport of the chromosomes. After the chromosomes have cleared\nthe midpoint of the elongated cell, cytoplasmic separation begins. The formation of a ring composed of repeating units of\na protein called FtsZ directs the partition between the nucleoids. Formation of the FtsZ ring triggers the accumulation of\nother proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site. A septum is formed between\nthe nucleoids, extending gradually from the periphery toward the center of the cell. When the new cell walls are in place,\nthe daughter cells separate.\nFigure 10.16 These images show the steps of binary fission in prokaryotes. (credit: modification of work by\n\u201cMcstrother\u201d/Wikimedia Commons)\nChapter 10 | Cell Reproduction\n431\nThe precise timing and formation of the mitotic spindle is critical to the success of eukaryotic cell division.\nProkaryotic cells, on the other hand, do not undergo karyokinesis and therefore have no need for a mitotic\nspindle. However, the FtsZ protein that plays such a vital role in prokaryotic cytokinesis is structurally\nand functionally very similar to tubulin, the building block of the microtubules that make up the mitotic\nspindle fibers that are necessary for eukaryotes. FtsZ proteins can form filaments, rings, and other three-\ndimensional structures that resemble the way tubulin forms microtubules, centrioles, and various\ncytoskeletal components. In addition, both FtsZ and tubulin employ the same energy source, GTP\n(guanosine triphosphate), to rapidly assemble and disassemble complex structures.\nFtsZ and tubulin are homologous structures derived from common evolutionary origins. In this example,\nFtsZ is the ancestor protein to tubulin (a modern protein). While both proteins are found in extant organisms,\ntubulin function has evolved and diversified tremendously since evolving from its FtsZ prokaryotic origin.\nA survey of mitotic assembly components found in present-day unicellular eukaryotes reveals crucial\nintermediary steps to the complex membrane-enclosed genomes of multicellular eukaryotes (Table 10.4).\nCell Division Apparatus among Various Organisms\nStructure of\ngenetic material\nDivision of nuclear material\nSeparation\nof\ndaughter\ncells\nProkaryotes\nThere is no nucleus.\nThe single, circular\nchromosome exists in a\nregion of cytoplasm\ncalled the nucleoid.\nOccurs through binary fission.

        "summary": "Prokaryotic cell division occurs through a simpler and faster process than in eukaryotes, called binary fission, which is the primary means of reproduction for unicellular organisms like bacteria. In this process, the single, circular DNA chromosome\u2014located in the nucleoid region and lacking histones\u2014is replicated bidirectionally from a defined origin near its attachment point to the plasma membrane. As replication proceeds, the two origins move toward opposite ends of the cell, aided by cell elongation. Once the chromosomes have moved apart, a protein called FtsZ forms a ring at the cell\u2019s midpoint, recruiting other proteins to synthesize new membrane and cell wall material, creating a septum between the nucleoids. The septum grows inward until division is complete, resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells. FtsZ is structurally and functionally similar to eukaryotic tubulin, both using GTP to assemble and disassemble, but whereas tubulin forms the mitotic spindle that separates chromosomes during eukaryotic mitosis, FtsZ functions to pinch the prokaryotic cell in two."

After trillions of cell\ndivisions, each of us develops into a complex, multicellular organism. (credit a: modification of work by Frank Wouters;\ncredit b: modification of work by Ken Cole, USGS; credit c: modification of work by Martin Pettitt)\nChapter Outline\n11.1: The Process of Meiosis\n11.2: Sexual Reproduction\nIntroduction\nThe ability to reproduce \u201cin kind\u201d is a basic characteristic of all living things. \u201cIn kind\u201d means that the offspring of an\norganism closely resembles its parent or parents. Hippopotamuses give birth to hippopotamus calves, Joshua trees produce\nJoshua tree seedlings, and flamingos lay eggs that hatch into flamingo chicks. In kind can mean exactly the same. Many\nunicellular organisms, such as yeast, and a few multicellular organisms, such as sponges, can produce genetically identical\nclones of themselves through cell division. However, many single-celled organisms and most multicellular organisms\nreproduce regularly using a method requiring two parents. Sexual reproduction occurs through the production by each\nparent of a haploid cell (containing one half of an offspring\u2019s required genetic material) and the fusion of these two haploid\ncells to form a single, unique diploid cell with a complete set of genetic information. In most plants and animals, through\nmultiple rounds of mitotic cell division, this diploid cell will develop into an adult organism. Haploid cells that are necessary\nfor sexual reproduction are produced by a type of cell division called meiosis. Sexual reproduction, specifically meiosis and\nfertilization, introduces variation into offspring. Variation is an important component of a species evolutionary success. The\nvast majority of eukaryotic organisms employs some form of meiosis and fertilization to reproduce.\nNot all sexually reproducing eukaryotes reproduce solely by sexual reproduction. For example, an Asian termite species,\nReticulitermes speratus, can reproduce sexually or asexually. In a young colony, a single termite pair\u2014the king and\nqueen\u2014produce worker offspring sexually by the union of haploid cells. However, after several years, as the queen begins\nto age, she produces some offspring asexually in a process called parthenogenesis. These offspring, which are destined\nto become new queens, are not fertilized by the king. They are genetic clones of the queen. More information about\nparthenogenesis in these termites can be found at this article (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32termitequeen) .\nChapter 11 | Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction\n445\n11.1 | The Process of Meiosis\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow do chromosomes behave during meiosis?\n\u2022\nWhat cellular events occur during meiosis?\n\u2022\nWhat are the similarities and differences between meiosis and mitosis?\n\u2022\nHow can the process of meiosis generate genetic variation?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nAs we explored the cell cycle and mitosis in a previous chapter, we learned that cells divide to grow, replace other cells,\nand reproduce asexually. Without mutation, or changes in the DNA, the daughter cells produced by mitosis receive a set of\ngenetic instructions that is identical to that of the parent cell. Because changes in genes drive both the unity and diversity of\nlife, organisms without genetic variation cannot evolve through natural selection. Evolution occurs only because organisms\nhave developed ways to vary their genetic material. This occurs through mutations in DNA, recombination of genes during\nmeiosis, and meiosis followed by fertilization in sexually reproducing organisms.\nSexual reproduction requires that diploid (2n) organisms produce haploid (1n) cells through meiosis and that these haploid\ncells fuse to form new, diploid offspring. The union of these two haploid cells, one from each parent, is fertilization.\nAlthough the processes of meiosis and mitosis share similarities, their end products are different. Recall that eukaryotic\nDNA is contained in chromosomes, and that chromosomes occur in homologous pairs (homologues). At fertilization, the\nmale parent contributes one member of each homologous pair to the offspring, and the female parent contributes the other.\nWith the exception of the sex chromosomes, homologous chromosomes contain the same genes, but these genes can have\ndifferent variations, called alleles. (For example, you might have inherited an allele for brown eyes from your father and\nan allele for blue eyes from your mother.) As in mitosis, homologous chromosomes are duplicated during the S-stage\n(synthesis) of interphase. However, unlike mitosis, in which there is just one nuclear division, meiosis has two complete\nrounds of nuclear division\u2014meiosis I and meiosis II. These result in four nuclei and (usually) four daughter cells, each with\nhalf the number of chromosomes as the parent cell (1n). The first division, meiosis I, separates homologous chromosomes,\nand the second division, meiosis II, separates chromatids. (Remember: during meiosis, DNA replicates ONCE but divides\nTWICE, whereas in mitosis, DNA replicates ONCE but divides only ONCE.).\nAlthough mitosis and meiosis are similar in many ways, they have different outcomes. The main difference is in the type of\ncell produced: mitosis produces identical cells, allowing growth or repair of tissues; meiosis generates reproductive cells, or\ngametes. Gametes, often called sex cells, unite with other sex cells to produce new, unique organisms.\nGenetic variation occurs during meiosis I, in which homologous chromosomes pair and exchange non-sister chromatid\nsegments (crossover). Here the homologous chromosomes separate into different nuclei, causing a reduction in \u201cploidy.\u201d\nDuring meiosis II\u2014which is more similar to a mitotic division\u2014the chromatids separate and segregate into four haploid sex\ncells. However, because of crossover, the resultant daughter cells do not contain identical genomes. As in mitosis, external\nfactors and internal signals regulate the meiotic cell cycle. As we will explore in more detail in a later chapter, errors in\nmeiosis can cause genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and learning objectives outlined in Big\nIdea 3 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 1.9][APLO 2.15][APLO 2.39][APLO 3.11][APLO 3.9]\nYou read that fertilization is the union of two sex cells from two individual organisms. If these two cells each contain\none set of chromosomes, the resulting fertilized cell contains two sets of chromosomes. Haploid cells contain one set of\nchromosomes. Cells containing two sets of chromosomes are called diploid. The number of sets of chromosomes in a cell\nis called its ploidy level. If the reproductive cycle is to continue, a diploid cell must reduce the number of its chromosome\nsets before fertilization can occur again. Otherwise, the number of chromosome sets would double, and continue to double\nin every generation. So, in addition to fertilization, sexual reproduction includes a nuclear division that reduces the number\nof chromosome sets.\nMost animals and plants are diploid, containing two sets of chromosomes. In an organism\u2019s somatic cells, sometimes\nreferred to as \u201cbody\u201d cells (all cells of a multicellular organism except the reproductive cells), the nucleus contains two\ncopies of each chromosome, called homologous chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes are matched pairs containing the\nsame genes in identical locations along their length. Diploid organisms inherit one copy of each homologous chromosome\nfrom each parent; all together, they are considered a full set of chromosomes. Haploid cells, containing a single copy of\neach homologous chromosome, are found only within an organism\u2019\u2019s reproductive structures, such as the ovaries and testes.\nHaploid cells can be either gametes or spores. Male gametes are sperm and female gametes are eggs. All animals and most\nplants produce gametes. Spores are haploid cells that can produce a haploid organism or can fuse with another spore to form\na diploid cell. Some plants and all fungi produce spores.\nAs you have learned, the nuclear division that forms haploid cells\u2014 meiosis\u2014is closely related to mitosis. Mitosis is the\npart of a cell reproduction cycle that results in identical daughter nuclei that are also genetically identical to the original\nparent nucleus. In mitosis, both the parent and the daughter nuclei are at the same ploidy level\u2014diploid for most plants and\nanimals. Meiosis employs many of the same mechanisms as mitosis. However, the starting nucleus is always diploid and the\nnuclei that result at the end of a meiotic cell division are haploid. To achieve this reduction in chromosome number, meiosis\nconsists of one round of chromosome duplication and two rounds of nuclear division. Because the events that occur during\neach of the division stages are analogous to the events of mitosis, the same stage names are assigned. However, because\nthere are two rounds of division, the major process and the stages are designated with a \u201cI\u201d or a \u201cII.\u201d Thus, meiosis I is the\nfirst round of meiotic division and consists of prophase I, prometaphase I, and so on. Meiosis II, in which the second round\nof meiotic division takes place, includes prophase II, prometaphase II, and so on.\nMeiosis I\nMeiosis is preceded by an interphase consisting of the G1, S, and G2 phases, which are nearly identical to the phases\npreceding mitosis. The G1 phase, which is also called the first gap phase, is the first phase of the interphase and is focused\non cell growth. The S phase is the second phase of interphase, during which the DNA of the chromosomes is replicated.\nFinally, the G2 phase, also called the second gap phase, is the third and final phase of interphase; in this phase, the cell\nundergoes the final preparations for meiosis.\nDuring DNA duplication in the S phase, each chromosome is replicated to produce two identical copies, called sister\nchromatids, that are held together at the centromere by cohesin proteins. Cohesin holds the chromatids together until\nChapter 11 | Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction\n447\nanaphase II. The centrosomes, which are the structures that organize the microtubules of the meiotic spindle, also replicate.\nThis prepares the cell to enter prophase I, the first meiotic phase.\nProphase I\nEarly in prophase I, before the chromosomes can be seen clearly microscopically, the homologous chromosomes are\nattached at their tips to the nuclear envelope by proteins. As the nuclear envelope begins to break down, the proteins\nassociated with homologous chromosomes bring the pair close to each other. Recall that, in mitosis, homologous\nchromosomes do not pair together. In mitosis, homologous chromosomes line up end-to-end so that when they divide,\neach daughter cell receives a sister chromatid from both members of the homologous pair. The synaptonemal complex,\na lattice of proteins between the homologous chromosomes, first forms at specific locations and then spreads to cover the\nentire length of the chromosomes. The tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis. In synapsis, the\ngenes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are aligned precisely with each other. The synaptonemal complex\nsupports the exchange of chromosomal segments between non-sister homologous chromatids, a process called crossing\nover. Crossing over can be observed visually after the exchange as chiasmata (singular = chiasma) (Figure 11.2).\nIn species such as humans, even though the X and Y sex chromosomes are not homologous (most of their genes differ), they\nhave a small region of homology that allows the X and Y chromosomes to pair up during prophase I. A partial synaptonemal\ncomplex develops only between the regions of homology.\nFigure 11.2 Early in prophase I, homologous chromosomes come together to form a synapse. The chromosomes are\nbound tightly together and in perfect alignment by a protein lattice called a synaptonemal complex and by cohesin\nproteins at the centromere.\nLocated at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called recombination nodules. These\nassemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossover\u2014or genetic\nrecombination\u2014between the non-sister chromatids. Near the recombination nodule on each chromatid, the double-stranded\nDNA is cleaved, the cut ends are modified, and a new connection is made between the non-sister chromatids. As prophase\nI progresses, the synaptonemal complex begins to break down and the chromosomes begin to condense. When the\nsynaptonemal complex is gone, the homologous chromosomes remain attached to each other at the centromere and at\nchiasmata. The chiasmata remain until anaphase I. The number of chiasmata varies according to the species and the length\nof the chromosome. There must be at least one chiasma per chromosome for proper separation of homologous chromosomes\nduring meiosis I, but there may be as many as 25. Following crossover, the synaptonemal complex breaks down and\nthe cohesin connection between homologous pairs is also removed. At the end of prophase I, the pairs are held together\nonly at the chiasmata (Figure 11.3) and are called tetrads because the four sister chromatids of each pair of homologous\nchromosomes are now visible.\nThe crossover events are the first source of genetic variation in the nuclei produced by meiosis. A single crossover\nevent between homologous non-sister chromatids leads to a reciprocal exchange of equivalent DNA between a maternal\nchromosome and a paternal chromosome. Now, when that sister chromatid is moved into a gamete cell it will carry some\nDNA from one parent of the individual and some DNA from the other parent. The sister recombinant chromatid has a\ncombination of maternal and paternal genes that did not exist before the crossover. Multiple crossovers in an arm of the\nchromosome have the same effect, exchanging segments of DNA to create recombinant chromosomes.\n448\nChapter 11 | Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 11.3 Crossover occurs between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. The result is an exchange\nof genetic material between homologous chromosomes.\nPrometaphase I\nThe key event in prometaphase I is the attachment of the spindle fiber microtubules to the kinetochore proteins at\nthe centromeres. Kinetochore proteins are multiprotein complexes that bind the centromeres of a chromosome to the\nmicrotubules of the mitotic spindle. Microtubules grow from centrosomes placed at opposite poles of the cell. The\nmicrotubules move toward the middle of the cell and attach to one of the two fused homologous chromosomes. The\nmicrotubules attach at each chromosomes' kinetochores. With each member of the homologous pair attached to opposite\npoles of the cell, in the next phase, the microtubules can pull the homologous pair apart. A spindle fiber that has attached\nto a kinetochore is called a kinetochore microtubule. At the end of prometaphase I, each tetrad is attached to microtubules\nfrom both poles, with one homologous chromosome facing each pole. The homologous chromosomes are still held together\nat chiasmata. In addition, the nuclear membrane has broken down entirely.\nMetaphase I\nDuring metaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are arranged in the center of the cell with the kinetochores facing\nopposite poles. The homologous pairs orient themselves randomly at the equator. For example, if the two homologous\nmembers of chromosome 1 are labeled a and b, then the chromosomes could line up a-b, or b-a. This is important in\ndetermining the genes carried by a gamete, as each will only receive one of the two homologous chromosomes. Recall\nthat homologous chromosomes are not identical. They contain slight differences in their genetic information, causing each\ngamete to have a unique genetic makeup.\nThis randomness is the physical basis for the creation of the second form of genetic variation in offspring. Consider\nthat the homologous chromosomes of a sexually reproducing organism are originally inherited as two separate sets, one\nfrom each parent. Using humans as an example, one set of 23 chromosomes is present in the egg donated by the mother.\nThe father provides the other set of 23 chromosomes in the sperm that fertilizes the egg. Every cell of the multicellular\noffspring has copies of the original two sets of homologous chromosomes. In prophase I of meiosis, the homologous\nChapter 11 | Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction\n449\nchromosomes form the tetrads. In metaphase I, these pairs line up at the midway point between the two poles of the cell\nto form the metaphase plate. Because there is an equal chance that a microtubule fiber will encounter a maternally or\npaternally inherited chromosome, the arrangement of the tetrads at the metaphase plate is random. Any maternally inherited\nchromosome may face either pole. Any paternally inherited chromosome may also face either pole. The orientation of each\ntetrad is independent of the orientation of the other 22 tetrads.\nThis event\u2014the random (or independent) assortment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plate\u2014is the second\nmechanism that introduces variation into the gametes or spores. In each cell that undergoes meiosis, the arrangement of\nthe tetrads is different. The number of variations is dependent on the number of chromosomes making up a set. There\nare two possibilities for orientation at the metaphase plate; the possible number of alignments therefore equals 2n, where\nn is the number of chromosomes per set. Humans have 23 chromosome pairs, which results in over eight million (223)\npossible genetically-distinct gametes. This number does not include the variability that was previously created in the sister\nchromatids by crossover. Given these two mechanisms, it is highly unlikely that any two haploid cells resulting from meiosis\nwill have the same genetic composition (Figure 11.4).\nTo summarize the genetic consequences of meiosis I, the maternal and paternal genes are recombined by crossover events\nthat occur between each homologous pair during prophase I. In addition, the random assortment of tetrads on the metaphase\nplate produces a unique combination of maternal and paternal chromosomes that will make their way into the gametes.\nFigure 11.4 Random, independent assortment during metaphase I can be demonstrated by considering a cell with a\nset of two chromosomes (n = 2). In this case, there are two possible arrangements at the equatorial plane in metaphase\nI. The total possible number of different gametes is 2n, where n equals the number of chromosomes in a set. In this\nexample, there are four possible genetic combinations for the gametes. With n = 23 in human cells, there are over 8\nmillion possible combinations of paternal and maternal chromosomes.\nAnaphase I\nIn anaphase I, the microtubules pull the linked chromosomes apart. The sister chromatids remain tightly bound together\nat the centromere. The chiasmata are broken in anaphase I as the microtubules attached to the fused kinetochores pull the\nhomologous chromosomes apart (Figure 11.5).\n450\nChapter 11 | Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nTelophase I and Cytokinesis\nIn telophase, the separated chromosomes arrive at opposite poles. The remainder of the typical telophase events may or may\nnot occur, depending on the species. In some organisms, the chromosomes decondense and nuclear envelopes form around\nthe chromatids in telophase I. In other organisms, cytokinesis\u2014the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into\ntwo daughter cells\u2014occurs without reformation of the nuclei. In nearly all species of animals and some fungi, cytokinesis\nseparates the cell contents via a cleavage furrow (constriction of the actin ring that leads to cytoplasmic division). In plants,\na cell plate is formed during cell cytokinesis by Golgi vesicles fusing at the metaphase plate. This cell plate will ultimately\nlead to the formation of cell walls that separate the two daughter cells.\nTwo haploid cells are the end result of the first meiotic division. The cells are haploid because at each pole, there is just\none of each pair of the homologous chromosomes. Therefore, only one full set of the chromosomes is present. This is why\nthe cells are considered haploid\u2014there is only one chromosome set, even though each homolog still consists of two sister\nchromatids. Recall that sister chromatids are merely duplicates of one of the two homologous chromosomes (except for\nchanges that occurred during crossing over). In meiosis II, these two sister chromatids will separate, creating four haploid\ndaughter cells.\nReview the process of meiosis, observing how chromosomes align and migrate, at Meiosis: An Interactive Animation\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/animal_meiosis) .\nHuman males typically have XY chromosomes and females have XX chromosomes, but there are rare instances in\nwhich a male can inherit an XXY or an XYY, or a female can have three X chromosomes. Explain how an error in\nmeiosis can cause these aberrations.\na.\nErrors can arise only during the recombination process which may result in deletions, duplications or\ntranslocations causing such abnormalities.\nb.\nAberrations caused when a pair of homologous chromosomes fails to separate during anaphase I or when\nsister chromatids fail to separate during anaphase II, the daughter cells will inherit unequal numbers of\nchromosomes.\nc.\nErrors during anaphase I of meiosis only cause such aberrations resulting in unequal numbers of\nchromosomes.\nd.\nErrors during meiosis introduce variations in the DNA sequence, which depends specifically on the size of\nthe variant only.\nMeiosis II\nIn some species, cells enter a brief interphase, or interkinesis, before entering meiosis II. Interkinesis lacks an S phase,\nso chromosomes are not duplicated. The two cells produced in meiosis I go through the events of meiosis II in synchrony.\nDuring meiosis II, the sister chromatids within the two daughter cells separate, forming four new haploid gametes. The\nmechanics of meiosis II is similar to mitosis, except that each dividing cell has only one set of homologous chromosomes.\nTherefore, each cell has half the number of sister chromatids to separate out as a diploid cell undergoing mitosis.\nProphase II\nIf the chromosomes decondensed in telophase I, they condense again. If nuclear envelopes were formed, they fragment into\nvesicles. The centrosomes that were duplicated during interkinesis move away from each other toward opposite poles, and\nnew spindles are formed.\nPrometaphase II\nThe nuclear envelopes are completely broken down, and the spindle is fully formed. Each sister chromatid forms an\nChapter 11 | Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction\n451\nindividual kinetochore that attaches to microtubules from opposite poles.\nMetaphase II\nThe sister chromatids are maximally condensed and aligned at the equator of the cell.\nAnaphase II\nThe sister chromatids are pulled apart by the kinetochore microtubules and move toward opposite poles. Non-kinetochore\nmicrotubules elongate the cell.\nFigure 11.5 The process of chromosome alignment differs between meiosis I and meiosis II. In prometaphase I,\nmicrotubules attach to the fused kinetochores of homologous chromosomes, and the homologous chromosomes are\narranged at the midpoint of the cell in metaphase I. In anaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are separated. In\nprometaphase II, microtubules attach to the kinetochores of sister chromatids, and the sister chromatids are arranged\nat the midpoint of the cells in metaphase II. In anaphase II, the sister chromatids are separated.\nTelophase II and Cytokinesis\nThe chromosomes arrive at opposite poles and begin to decondense. Nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes.\nCytokinesis separates the two cells into four unique haploid cells. At this point, the newly formed nuclei are both haploid.\nThe cells produced are genetically unique because of the random assortment of paternal and maternal homologs and\nbecause of the recombining of maternal and paternal segments of chromosomes (with their sets of genes) that occurs during\ncrossover. The entire process of meiosis is outlined in Figure 11.6.\n452\nChapter 11 | Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 11.6 An animal cell with a diploid number of four (2n = 4) proceeds through the stages of meiosis to form four\nhaploid daughter cells.\nComparing Meiosis and Mitosis\nMitosis and meiosis are both forms of division of the nucleus in eukaryotic cells. They share some similarities, but also\nexhibit distinct differences that lead to very different outcomes (Figure 11.7). Mitosis is a single nuclear division that results\nin two nuclei that are usually partitioned into two new cells. The nuclei resulting from a mitotic division are genetically\nidentical to the original nucleus. They have the same number of sets of chromosomes, one set in the case of haploid cells\nand two sets in the case of diploid cells. In most plants and all animal species, it is typically diploid cells that undergo\nmitosis to form new diploid cells. In contrast, meiosis consists of two nuclear divisions resulting in four nuclei that are\nusually partitioned into four new cells. The nuclei resulting from meiosis are not genetically identical and they contain one\nchromosome set only. This is half the number of chromosome sets in the original cell, which is diploid.\nChapter 11 | Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction\n453\nThe main differences between mitosis and meiosis occur in meiosis I, which is a very different nuclear division than\nmitosis. In meiosis I, the homologous chromosome pairs become associated with each other, are bound together with\nthe synaptonemal complex, develop chiasmata and undergo crossover between sister chromatids, and line up along the\nmetaphase plate in tetrads with kinetochore fibers from opposite spindle poles attached to each kinetochore of a homolog in\na tetrad. All of these events occur only in meiosis I.\nWhen the chiasmata resolve and the tetrad is broken up with the homologs moving to one pole or another, the ploidy\nlevel\u2014the number of sets of chromosomes in each future nucleus\u2014has been reduced from two to one. For this reason,\nmeiosis I is referred to as a reduction division. There is no such reduction in ploidy level during mitosis.\nMeiosis II is much more analogous to a mitotic division. In this case, the duplicated chromosomes (only one set of them) line\nup on the metaphase plate with divided kinetochores attached to kinetochore fibers from opposite poles. During anaphase\nII, as in mitotic anaphase, the kinetochores divide and one sister chromatid\u2014now referred to as a chromosome\u2014is pulled\nto one pole while the other sister chromatid is pulled to the other pole. If it were not for the fact that there had been\ncrossover, the two products of each individual meiosis II division would be identical (like in mitosis). Instead, they are\ndifferent because there has always been at least one crossover per chromosome. Meiosis II is not a reduction division\nbecause although there are fewer copies of the genome in the resulting cells, there is still one set of chromosomes, as there\nwas at the end of meiosis I.\nFigure 11.7 Meiosis and mitosis are both preceded by one round of DNA replication; however, meiosis includes two\nnuclear divisions. The four daughter cells resulting from meiosis are haploid and genetically distinct.

Meiosis is such an extraordinarily complex series\nof cellular events that biologists have had trouble hypothesizing and testing how it may have evolved.\nAlthough meiosis is inextricably entwined with sexual reproduction and its advantages and disadvantages,\nit is important to separate the questions of the evolution of meiosis and the evolution of sex, because early\nmeiosis may have been advantageous for different reasons than it is now. Thinking outside the box and\nimagining what the early benefits from meiosis might have been is one approach to uncovering how it may\nhave evolved.\nMeiosis and mitosis share obvious cellular processes and it makes sense that meiosis evolved from mitosis.\nThe difficulty lies in the clear differences between meiosis I and mitosis. Adam Wilkins and Robin Holliday[1]\nsummarized the unique events that needed to occur for the evolution of meiosis from mitosis. These steps\nare homologous chromosome pairing, crossover exchanges, sister chromatids remaining attached during\nanaphase, and suppression of DNA replication in interphase. They argue that the first step is the hardest\nand most important, and that understanding how it evolved would make the evolutionary process clearer.\nThey suggest genetic experiments that might shed light on the evolution of synapsis.\nThere are other approaches to understanding the evolution of meiosis in progress. Different forms of meiosis\nexist in single-celled protists. Some appear to be simpler or more \u201cprimitive\u201d forms of meiosis. Comparing\nthe meiotic divisions of different protists may shed light on the evolution of meiosis. Marilee Ramesh and\ncolleagues[2] compared the genes involved in meiosis in protists to understand when and where meiosis\nmight have evolved. Although research is still ongoing, recent scholarship into meiosis in protists suggests\nthat some aspects of meiosis may have evolved later than others.

        "summary": "Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, producing four genetically unique haploid cells from an original diploid cell, and is essential for sexual reproduction. It involves one round of DNA replication followed by two nuclear divisions: meiosis I, a reduction division where homologous chromosomes pair, undergo crossing over during prophase I to exchange genetic material, and then separate, generating genetic variation through both recombination and the random assortment of chromosomes; and meiosis II, which closely resembles mitosis, where sister chromatids separate. The process begins after interphase (G1, S, G2) and proceeds through defined stages\u2014prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis\u2014for each division. Meiosis produces gametes (sperm and eggs in animals) or spores (in some plants and fungi) and is tightly regulated. It differs from mitosis in outcomes, genetic variation introduced, and the unique events of meiosis I. Errors in chromosome separation can lead to abnormalities, and meiosis likely evolved from mitosis, with key innovations like homolog pairing, crossover, and suppression of DNA replication between divisions contributing to its distinct role in generating genetic diversity for evolution."

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 3.7][APLO 3.9][APLO 3.24][APLO 3.28]\nSexual reproduction was an early evolutionary innovation after the appearance of eukaryotic cells. It appears to have\nbeen very successful because most eukaryotes are able to reproduce sexually, and in many animals, it is the only mode\nof reproduction. And yet, scientists recognize some real disadvantages to sexual reproduction. On the surface, creating\noffspring that are genetic clones of the parent appears to be a better system. If the parent organism is successfully occupying\na habitat, offspring with the same traits would be similarly successful. There is also the obvious benefit to an organism that\ncan produce offspring whenever circumstances are favorable by asexual budding, fragmentation, or asexual eggs. These\nmethods of reproduction do not require another organism of the opposite sex. Indeed, some organisms that lead a solitary\nlifestyle have retained the ability to reproduce asexually. In addition, in asexual populations, every individual is capable\nof reproduction. In sexual populations, the males are not producing the offspring themselves, so in theory an asexual\npopulation could grow twice as fast.\nHowever, multicellular organisms that exclusively depend on asexual reproduction are exceedingly rare. Why is sexuality\n(and meiosis) so common? This is one of the important unanswered questions in biology and has been the focus of much\nresearch beginning in the latter half of the twentieth century. There are several possible explanations, one of which is that\nthe variation that sexual reproduction creates among offspring is very important to the survival and reproduction of the\npopulation. Thus, on average, a sexually reproducing population will leave more descendants than an otherwise similar\nasexually reproducing population. The only source of variation in asexual organisms is mutation. This is the ultimate source\nof variation in sexual organisms, but in addition, those different mutations are continually reshuffled from one generation\nto the next when different parents combine their unique genomes and the genes are mixed into different combinations by\ncrossovers during prophase I and random assortment at metaphase I.\nChapter 11 | Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction\n457\nThe Red Queen Hypothesis\nIt is not in dispute that sexual reproduction provides evolutionary advantages to organisms that employ\nthis mechanism to produce offspring. But why, even in the face of fairly stable conditions, does sexual\nreproduction persist when it is more difficult and costly for individual organisms? Variation is the outcome\nof sexual reproduction, but why are ongoing variations necessary? Enter the Red Queen hypothesis, first\nproposed by Leigh Van Valen in 1973.[3] The concept was named in reference to the Red Queen's race in\nLewis Carroll's book, Through the Looking-Glass.\nAll species co-evolve with other organisms; for example predators evolve with their prey, and parasites\nevolve with their hosts. Each tiny advantage gained by favorable variation gives a species an edge over\nclose competitors, predators, parasites, or even prey. The only method that will allow a co-evolving species\nto maintain its own share of the resources is to also continually improve its fitness. As one species gains\nan advantage, this increases selection pressure on the other species; they must also develop an advantage\nor they will be outcompeted. No single species progresses too far ahead because genetic variation among\nthe progeny of sexual reproduction provides all species with a mechanism to improve rapidly. Species that\ncannot keep up become extinct. The Red Queen\u2019s catchphrase was, \u201cIt takes all the running you can do to\nstay in the same place.\u201d This is an apt description of co-evolution between competing species.\nWhich of the following scenarios provides the best support for the Red Queen Hypothesis?\na.\nAn asexually reproducing plant rapidly populates a hillside left barren by a fire.\nb.\nIndividuals of a snail population that reproduce asexually die out after a parasite invades its territory.\nc.\nA widely dispersed population of ruffed grouse disappears because individuals have difficulty finding mates.\nd.\nA sexually-reproducing species of gophers goes extinct after a new predator is introduced.\nLife Cycles of Sexually Reproducing Organisms\nFertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles. What happens between these two events depends on the organism.\nThe process of meiosis reduces the chromosome number by half. Fertilization, the joining of two haploid gametes, restores\nthe diploid condition. There are three main categories of life cycles in multicellular organisms: diploid-dominant, in\nwhich the multicellular diploid stage is the most obvious life stage, such as with most animals including humans; haploid-\ndominant, in which the multicellular haploid stage is the most obvious life stage, such as with all fungi and some algae;\nand alternation of generations, in which the two stages are apparent to different degrees depending on the group, as with\nplants and some algae.\nDiploid-Dominant Life Cycle\nNearly all animals employ a diploid-dominant life-cycle strategy in which the only haploid cells produced by the organism\nare the gametes. Early in the development of the embryo, specialized diploid cells, called germ cells, are produced within\nthe gonads, such as the testes and ovaries. Germ cells are capable of mitosis to perpetuate the cell line and meiosis to\nproduce gametes. Once the haploid gametes are formed, they lose the ability to divide again. There is no multicellular\nhaploid life stage. Fertilization occurs with the fusion of two gametes, usually from different individuals, restoring the\ndiploid state (Figure 11.8).\n3. Leigh Van Valen, \u201cA New Evolutionary Law,\u201d Evolutionary Theory 1 (1973): 1\u201330\n458\nChapter 11 | Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 11.8 In animals, sexually reproducing adults form haploid gametes from diploid germ cells. Fusion of the\ngametes gives rise to a fertilized egg cell, or zygote. The zygote will undergo multiple rounds of mitosis to produce a\nmulticellular offspring. The germ cells are generated early in the development of the zygote.\nHaploid-Dominant Life Cycle\nMost fungi and algae employ a life-cycle type in which the \u201cbody\u201d of the organism\u2014the ecologically important part of the\nlife cycle\u2014is haploid. The haploid cells that make up the tissues of the dominant multicellular stage are formed by mitosis.\nDuring sexual reproduction, specialized haploid cells from two individuals, designated the (+) and (\u2212) mating types, join to\nform a diploid zygote. The zygote immediately undergoes meiosis to form four haploid cells called spores. Although haploid\nlike the \u201cparents,\u201d these spores contain a new genetic combination from two parents. The spores can remain dormant for\nvarious time periods. Eventually, when conditions are conducive, the spores form multicellular haploid structures by many\nrounds of mitosis (Figure 11.9).\nChapter 11 | Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction\n459\nFigure 11.9 Fungi, such as black bread mold (Rhizopus nigricans), have haploid-dominant life cycles. The haploid\nmulticellular stage produces specialized haploid cells by mitosis that fuse to form a diploid zygote. The zygote\nundergoes meiosis to produce haploid spores. Each spore gives rise to a multicellular haploid organism by\nmitosis. (credit \u201czygomycota\u201d micrograph: modification of work by \u201cFanaberka\u201d/Wikimedia Commons)\nIf a mutation occurs so that a fungus is no longer able to produce a minus mating type, will it still be able to reproduce?\na.\nNo, sexual mode of reproduction is the only mode of reproduction in fungi.\nb.\nNo, absence of minus mating types will disrupt functions in fungi.\nc.\nYes, it will be able to reproduce asexually by the mitotic divisions of spores.\nd.\nYes, by action of some enzymes, it will be able to reproduce asexually.\nAlternation of Generations\nThe third life-cycle type, employed by some algae and all plants, is a blend of the haploid-dominant and diploid-dominant\nextremes. Species with alternation of generations have both haploid and diploid multicellular organisms as part of their\nlife cycle. The haploid multicellular plants are called gametophytes, because they produce gametes from specialized cells.\nMeiosis is not directly involved in the production of gametes in this case, because the organism that produces the gametes\nis already a haploid. Fertilization between the gametes forms a diploid zygote. The zygote will undergo many rounds of\nmitosis and give rise to a diploid multicellular plant called a sporophyte. Specialized cells of the sporophyte will undergo\nmeiosis and produce haploid spores. The spores will subsequently develop into the gametophytes (Figure 11.10).\n460\nChapter 11 | Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 11.10 Plants have a life cycle that alternates between a multicellular haploid organism and a multicellular\ndiploid organism. In some plants, such as ferns, both the haploid and diploid plant stages are free-living. The diploid\nplant is called a sporophyte because it produces haploid spores by meiosis. The spores develop into multicellular,\nhaploid plants called gametophytes because they produce gametes. The gametes of two individuals will fuse to form\na diploid zygote that becomes the sporophyte.

In plants such as moss, the gametophyte organism is the\nfree-living plant, and the sporophyte is physically dependent on the gametophyte. In other plants, such as ferns, both the\ngametophyte and sporophyte plants are free-living; however, the sporophyte is much larger. In seed plants, such as magnolia\ntrees and daisies, the gametophyte is composed of only a few cells and, in the case of the female gametophyte, is completely\nretained within the sporophyte.\nSexual reproduction takes many forms in multicellular organisms. However, at some point in each type of life cycle, meiosis\nproduces haploid cells that will fuse with the haploid cell of another organism. The mechanisms of variation\u2014crossover,\nrandom assortment of homologous chromosomes, and random fertilization\u2014are present in all versions of sexual\nreproduction. The fact that nearly every multicellular organism on Earth employs sexual reproduction is strong evidence for\nthe benefits of producing offspring with unique gene combinations, though there are other possible benefits as well.\nThink About It\nCompare and contrast the three main types of life cycles in multicellular organisms and give an example of\nan organism that employs each.\nChapter 11 | Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction\n461\nalternation of generations\nchiasmata\ncohesin\ncrossover\ndiploid-dominant\nfertilization\ngametophyte\ngerm cells\nhaploid-dominant\ninterkinesis\nlife cycle\nmeiosis\nmeiosis I\nmeiosis II\nrecombination nodules\nreduction division\nsomatic cell\nspore\nsporophyte\nsynapsis\nsynaptonemal complex\ntetrad\nKEY TERMS\nlife-cycle type in which the diploid and haploid stages alternate\n(singular, chiasma) the structure that forms at the crossover points after genetic material is exchanged\nproteins that form a complex that seals sister chromatids together at their centromeres until anaphase II of meiosis\nexchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids resulting in chromosomes that incorporate genes\nfrom both parents of the organism\nlife-cycle type in which the multicellular diploid stage is prevalent\nunion of two haploid cells from two individual organisms\na multicellular haploid life-cycle stage that produces gametes\nspecialized cell line that produces gametes, such as eggs or sperm\nlife-cycle type in which the multicellular haploid stage is prevalent\n(also, interphase II) brief period of rest between meiosis I and meiosis II\nthe sequence of events in the development of an organism and the production of cells that produce offspring\na nuclear division process that results in four haploid cells\nfirst round of meiotic cell division; referred to as reduction division because the ploidy level is reduced from\ndiploid to haploid\nsecond round of meiotic cell division following meiosis I; sister chromatids are separated into individual\nchromosomes, and the result is four unique haploid cells\nprotein assemblies formed on the synaptonemal complex that mark the points of crossover\nevents and mediate the multistep process of genetic recombination between non-sister chromatids\nnuclear division that produces daughter nuclei each having one-half as many chromosome sets as the\nparental nucleus; meiosis I is a reduction division\nall the cells of a multicellular organism except the gametes or reproductive cells\nhaploid cell that can produce a haploid multicellular organism or can fuse with another spore to form a diploid cell\na multicellular diploid life-cycle stage that produces haploid spores by meiosis\nformation of a close association between homologous chromosomes during prophase I\nprotein lattice that forms between homologous chromosomes during prophase I, supporting\ncrossover\ntwo duplicated homologous chromosomes (four chromatids) bound together by chiasmata during prophase I",
        "summary": "Sexual reproduction, an early evolutionary innovation in eukaryotes, is widespread because it generates genetic variation that enhances survival and reproduction, despite being more costly and slower than asexual reproduction. Variation, produced through mechanisms like crossover, random chromosome assortment, and random fertilization, enables populations to adapt and compete, as explained by the Red Queen hypothesis, which highlights the need for constant adaptation in co-evolving species. Meiosis and fertilization alternate to maintain haploid and diploid stages, with three main life cycle strategies in multicellular organisms: diploid-dominant (most animals), where gametes are the only haploid cells; haploid-dominant (most fungi and some algae), where the organism\u2019s main stage is haploid; and alternation of generations (plants and some algae), where both haploid gametophytes and diploid sporophytes are multicellular stages. All these cycles rely on meiosis to produce haploid cells that fuse during fertilization, ensuring unique genetic combinations in offspring."

(credit:\nmodification of work by Jerry Kirkhart)\nChapter Outline\n12.1: Mendel\u2019s Experiments and the Laws of Probability\n12.2: Characteristics and Traits\n12.3: Laws of Inheritance\nIntroduction\nDuring the 19th century, long before chromosomes or genes had been identified, Johann Gregor Mendel set the framework\nfor genetics by studying a simple biological system, the garden pea. He conducted methodical, quantitative analyses using\nlarge sample sizes. Mendel\u2019s work laid the foundation for the fundamental principles of heredity. We now know that genes,\ncarried on chromosomes, are the basic functional units of heredity with the capacity to be replicated, expressed, repressed,\nmodified and mutated. Today, the postulates put forth by Mendel form the basis of classical, or Mendelian, genetics. Genes\ndo not all obey the tenets of Mendelian genetics, but Mendel\u2019s experiments serve as an excellent starting point for thinking\nabout inheritance.\nAn understanding of genetic inheritance enables scientists to study and explain complex phenomena. For example,\nscientists studied the remains of 84 ancient dogs from North and South America. They found that some of the dogs\nhad greater genetic diversity, indicating that these dogs might have interbred with American wolves. Other dogs in their\nsample had low diversity, indicating that ancient humans were purposely breeding dogs. The study also found that dogs\nmigrated to the Americas with humans only about 10,000 years ago. You can read more about this fascinating story here\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32dogs) .\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\n469\n12.1 | Mendel\u2019s Experiments and the Laws of\nProbability\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhy was Mendel\u2019s experimental work so successful?\n\u2022\nHow do the sum and product rules of probability predict the outcomes of monohybrid crosses involving dominant\nand recessive alleles?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nGenetics is the science of heredity. Austrian monk Gregor Mendel set the framework for genetics long before chromosomes\nor genes had been identified, at a time when meiosis was not well understood. Working with garden peas, Mendel found\nthat crosses between true-breading parents (P) that differed in one trait (e.g., color: green peas versus yellow peas) produced\nfirst generation (F1) offspring that all expressed the trait of one parent (e.g., all green or all yellow). Mendel used the\nterm dominant to refer to the trait that was observed, and recessive to denote that non-expressed trait, or the trait that had\n\u201cdisappeared\u201d in this first generation. When the F1 offspring were crossed with each other, the F2 offspring exhibited both\ntraits in a 3:1 ratio. Other crosses (e.g., height: tall plants versus short plants) generated the same 3:1 ratio (in this example,\ntall to short) in the F2 offspring. By mathematically examining sample sizes, Mendel showed that genetic crosses behaved\naccording to the laws of probability, and that the traits were inherited as independent events. In other words, Mendel used\nstatistical methods to build his model of inheritance.\nAs you have likely noticed, the AP Biology course emphasizes the application of mathematics. Two rules of probability can\nbe used to find the expected proportions of different traits in offspring from different crosses. To find the probability of two\nor more independent events (events where the outcome of one event has no influence on the outcome of the other event)\noccurring together, apply the product rule and multiply the probabilities of the individual events. To find the probability that\none of two or more events occur, apply the sum rule and add their probabilities together.\nThe content presented in this section supports the learning objectives outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum\nFramework.

As a young\nadult, he joined the Augustinian Abbey of St. Thomas in Brno in what is now the Czech Republic. Supported by the\nmonastery, he taught physics, botany, and natural science courses at the secondary and university levels. In 1856, he began\na decade-long research pursuit involving inheritance patterns in honeybees and plants, ultimately settling on pea plants as\nhis primary model system (a system with convenient characteristics used to study a specific biological phenomenon to be\napplied to other systems). In 1865, Mendel presented the results of his experiments with nearly 30,000 pea plants to the\nlocal Natural History Society. He demonstrated that traits are transmitted faithfully from parents to offspring independently\nof other traits and in dominant and recessive patterns. In 1866, he published his work, Experiments in Plant Hybridization,\n[1]\nin the proceedings of the Natural History Society of Br\u00fcnn.\nMendel\u2019s work went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community that believed, incorrectly, that the process of\ninheritance involved a blending of parental traits that produced an intermediate physical appearance in offspring; this\nhypothetical process appeared to be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation. Continuous variation\nresults from the action of many genes to determine a characteristic like human height. Offspring appear to be a \u201cblend\u201d of\ntheir parents\u2019 traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation. The blending theory of inheritance\nasserted that the original parental traits were lost or absorbed by the blending in the offspring, but we now know that this is\nnot the case. Mendel was the first researcher to see it. Instead of continuous characteristics, Mendel worked with traits that\nwere inherited in distinct classes (specifically, violet versus white flowers); this is referred to as discontinuous variation.\nMendel\u2019s choice of these kinds of traits allowed him to see experimentally that the traits were not blended in the offspring,\nnor were they absorbed, but rather that they kept their distinctness and could be passed on. In 1868, Mendel became abbot\nof the monastery and exchanged his scientific pursuits for his pastoral duties. He was not recognized for his extraordinary\nscientific contributions during his lifetime. In fact, it was not until 1900 that his work was rediscovered, reproduced, and\nrevitalized by scientists on the brink of discovering the chromosomal basis of heredity.\nMendel\u2019s Model System\nMendel\u2019s seminal work was accomplished using the garden pea, Pisum sativum, to study inheritance. This species naturally\nself-fertilizes, such that pollen encounters ova within individual flowers. The flower petals remain sealed tightly until after\npollination, preventing pollination from other plants. The result is highly inbred, or \u201ctrue-breeding,\u201d pea plants. These are\nplants that always produce offspring that look like the parent. By experimenting with true-breeding pea plants, Mendel\navoided the appearance of unexpected traits in offspring that might occur if the plants were not true breeding. The garden\npea also grows to maturity within one season, meaning that several generations could be evaluated over a relatively short\ntime. Finally, large quantities of garden peas could be cultivated simultaneously, allowing Mendel to conclude that his\nresults did not come about simply by chance.\n1.\nJohann Gregor Mendel, Versuche \u00fcber Pflanzenhybriden Verhandlungen des naturforschenden Vereines in Br\u00fcnn, Bd. IV f\u00fcr das Jahr, 1865 Abhandlungen, 3\u201347.\n[go here for the English translation here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32mendelPlain) ]\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\n471\nMendelian Crosses\nMendel performed hybridizations, which involve mating two true-breeding individuals that have different traits. In the pea,\nwhich is naturally self-pollinating, this is done by manually transferring pollen from the anther of a mature pea plant of\none variety to the stigma of a separate mature pea plant of the second variety. In plants, pollen carries the male gametes\n(sperm) to the stigma, a sticky organ that traps pollen and allows the sperm to move down the pistil to the female gametes\n(ova) below. To prevent the pea plant that was receiving pollen from self-fertilizing and confounding his results, Mendel\npainstakingly removed all of the anthers from the plant\u2019s flowers before they had a chance to mature.\nPlants used in first-generation crosses were called P0, or parental generation one, plants (Figure 12.3). Mendel collected the\nseeds belonging to the P0 plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following season. These offspring were\ncalled the F1, or the first filial (filial = offspring, daughter or son), generation. Once Mendel examined the characteristics\nin the F1 generation of plants, he allowed them to self-fertilize naturally. He then collected and grew the seeds from the F1\nplants to produce the F2, or second filial, generation. Mendel\u2019s experiments extended beyond the F2 generation to the F3 and\nF4 generations, and so on, but it was the ratio of characteristics in the P0\u2212F1\u2212F2 generations that were the most intriguing\nand became the basis for Mendel\u2019s postulates.\n472\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 12.3 In one of his experiments on inheritance patterns, Mendel crossed plants that were true-breeding for\nviolet flower color with plants true-breeding for white flower color (the P generation). The resulting hybrids in the F1\ngeneration all had violet flowers. In the F2 generation, approximately three quarters of the plants had violet flowers,\nand one quarter had white flowers.\nGarden Pea Characteristics Revealed the Basics of Heredity\nIn his 1865 publication, Mendel reported the results of his crosses involving seven different characteristics, each with two\ncontrasting traits. A trait is defined as a variation in the physical appearance of a heritable characteristic. The characteristics\nincluded plant height, seed texture, seed color, flower color, pea pod size, pea pod color, and flower position. For the\ncharacteristic of flower color, for example, the two contrasting traits were white versus violet. To fully examine each\ncharacteristic, Mendel generated large numbers of F1 and F2 plants, reporting results from 19,959 F2 plants alone. His\nfindings were consistent.\nWhat results did Mendel find in his crosses for flower color? First, Mendel confirmed that he had plants that bred true for\nwhite or violet flower color. Regardless of how many generations Mendel examined, all self-crossed offspring of parents\nwith white flowers had white flowers, and all self-crossed offspring of parents with violet flowers had violet flowers. In\naddition, Mendel confirmed that, other than flower color, the pea plants were physically identical.\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\n473\nOnce these validations were complete, Mendel applied the pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant\nwith white flowers. After gathering and sowing the seeds that resulted from this cross, Mendel found that 100 percent of the\nF1 hybrid generation had violet flowers. Conventional wisdom at that time would have predicted the hybrid flowers to be\npale violet or for hybrid plants to have equal numbers of white and violet flowers. In other words, the contrasting parental\ntraits were expected to blend in the offspring. Instead, Mendel\u2019s results demonstrated that the white flower trait in the F1\ngeneration had completely disappeared.\nImportantly, Mendel did not stop his experimentation there. He allowed the F1 plants to self-fertilize and found that, of\nF2-generation plants, 705 had violet flowers and 224 had white flowers. This was a ratio of 3.15 violet flowers per one white\nflower, or approximately 3:1. When Mendel transferred pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with\nwhite flowers and vice versa, he obtained about the same ratio regardless of which parent, male or female, contributed which\ntrait. This is called a reciprocal cross\u2014a paired cross in which the respective traits of the male and female in one cross\nbecome the respective traits of the female and male in the other cross. For the other six characteristics Mendel examined,\nthe F1 and F2 generations behaved in the same way as they had for flower color. One of the two traits would disappear\ncompletely from the F1 generation only to reappear in the F2 generation at a ratio of approximately 3:1 (Table 12.1).\nThe Results of Mendel\u2019s Garden Pea Hybridizations\nCharacteristic\nContrasting P0\nTraits\nF1 Offspring\nTraits\nF2 Offspring\nTraits\nF2 Trait\nRatios\nFlower color\nViolet vs. white\n100 percent violet\n705 violet\n224 white\n3.15:1\nFlower position\nAxial vs. terminal\n100 percent axial\n651 axial\n207 terminal\n3.14:1\nPlant height\nTall vs. dwarf\n100 percent tall\n787 tall\n277 dwarf\n2.84:1\nSeed texture\nRound vs. wrinkled\n100 percent round\n5,474 round\n1,850 wrinkled\n2.96:1\nSeed color\nYellow vs. green\n100 percent yellow\n6,022 yellow\n2,001 green\n3.01:1\nPea pod texture\nInflated vs. constricted\n100 percent inflated\n882 inflated\n299 constricted\n2.95:1\nPea pod color\nGreen vs. yellow\n100 percent green\n428 green\n152 yellow\n2.82:1\nTable 12.1\nUpon compiling his results for many thousands of plants, Mendel concluded that the characteristics could be divided into\nexpressed and latent traits. He called these, respectively, dominant and recessive traits. Dominant traits are those that are\ninherited unchanged in a hybridization. Recessive traits become latent, or disappear, in the offspring of a hybridization.\nThe recessive trait does, however, reappear in the progeny of the hybrid offspring. An example of a dominant trait is the\nviolet-flower trait. For this same characteristic (flower color), white-colored flowers are a recessive trait. The fact that\nthe recessive trait reappeared in the F2 generation meant that the traits remained separate (not blended) in the plants of\nthe F1 generation. Mendel also proposed that plants possessed two copies of the trait for the flower-color characteristic,\nand that each parent transmitted one of its two copies to its offspring, where they came together. Moreover, the physical\nobservation of a dominant trait could mean that the genetic composition of the organism included two dominant versions of\nthe characteristic or that it included one dominant and one recessive version. Conversely, the observation of a recessive trait\nmeant that the organism lacked any dominant versions of this characteristic.\n474\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nSo why did Mendel repeatedly obtain 3:1 ratios in his crosses? To understand how Mendel deduced the basic mechanisms\nof inheritance that lead to such ratios, we must first review the laws of probability.\nThink About It\nStudents are performing a cross involving seed color in garden pea plants. Yellow seed color is dominant to green\nseed color. What F1 offspring would be expected when cross true-breeding plants with green seeds with true-breading\nplants with yellow seeds? Express the answer(s) as percentage.\nProbability Basics\nProbabilities are mathematical measures of likelihood. The empirical probability of an event is calculated by dividing the\nnumber of times the event occurs by the total number of opportunities for the event to occur. It is also possible to calculate\ntheoretical probabilities by dividing the number of times that an event is expected to occur by the number of times that\nit could occur. Empirical probabilities come from observations, like those of Mendel. Theoretical probabilities come from\nknowing how the events are produced and assuming that the probabilities of individual outcomes are equal. A probability\nof one for some event indicates that it is guaranteed to occur, whereas a probability of zero indicates that it is guaranteed not\nto occur. An example of a genetic event is a round seed produced by a pea plant. In his experiment, Mendel demonstrated\nthat the probability of the event \u201cround seed\u201d occurring was one in the F1 offspring of true-breeding parents, one of which\nhas round seeds and one of which has wrinkled seeds. When the F1 plants were subsequently self-crossed, the probability of\nany given F2 offspring having round seeds was now three out of four. In other words, in a large population of F2 offspring\nchosen at random, 75 percent were expected to have round seeds, whereas 25 percent were expected to have wrinkled seeds.\nUsing large numbers of crosses, Mendel was able to calculate probabilities and use these to predict the outcomes of other\ncrosses.\nThe Product Rule and Sum Rule\nMendel demonstrated that the pea-plant characteristics he studied were transmitted as discrete units from parent to\noffspring. As will be discussed, Mendel also determined that different characteristics, like seed color and seed texture, were\ntransmitted independently of one another and could be considered in separate probability analyses. For instance, performing\na cross between a plant with green, wrinkled seeds and a plant with yellow, round seeds still produced offspring that had a\n3:1 ratio of green:yellow seeds (ignoring seed texture) and a 3:1 ratio of round:wrinkled seeds (ignoring seed color). The\ncharacteristics of color and texture did not influence each other.\nThe product rule of probability can be applied to this phenomenon of the independent transmission of characteristics. The\nproduct rule states that the probability of two independent events occurring together can be calculated by multiplying the\nindividual probabilities of each event occurring alone. To demonstrate the product rule, imagine that you are rolling a six-\nsided die (D) and flipping a penny (P) at the same time. The die may roll any number from 1\u20136 (D#), whereas the penny\nmay turn up heads (PH) or tails (PT). The outcome of rolling the die has no effect on the outcome of flipping the penny\nand vice versa. There are 12 possible outcomes of this action (Table 12.2), and each event is expected to occur with equal\nprobability.\nTwelve Equally Likely Outcomes of Rolling a Die and Flipping a Penny\nRolling Die\nFlipping Penny\nD1\nPH\nD1\nPT\nD2\nPH\nD2\nPT\nD3\nPH\nTable 12.2\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\n475\nTwelve Equally Likely Outcomes of Rolling a Die and Flipping a Penny\nRolling Die\nFlipping Penny\nD3\nPT\nD4\nPH\nD4\nPT\nD5\nPH\nD5\nPT\nD6\nPH\nD6\nPT\nTable 12.2\nOf the 12 possible outcomes, the die has a 2/12 (or 1/6) probability of rolling a two, and the penny has a 6/12 (or 1/2)\nprobability of coming up heads. By the product rule, the probability that you will obtain the combined outcome 2 and heads\nis: (D2) x (PH) = (1/6) x (1/2) or 1/12 (Table 12.3). Notice the word \u201cand\u201d in the description of the probability. The \u201cand\u201d is a\nsignal to apply the product rule. For example, consider how the product rule is applied to the dihybrid cross: the probability\nof having both dominant traits in the F2 progeny is the product of the probabilities of having the dominant trait for each\ncharacteristic, as shown here:\n3\n4 \u00d7 3\n4 =  9\n16\nOn the other hand, the sum rule of probability is applied when considering two mutually exclusive outcomes that can come\nabout by more than one pathway. The sum rule states that the probability of the occurrence of one event or the other event,\nof two mutually exclusive events, is the sum of their individual probabilities. Notice the word \u201cor\u201d in the description of the\nprobability. The \u201cor\u201d indicates that you should apply the sum rule. In this case, let\u2019s imagine you are flipping a penny (P)\nand a quarter (Q). What is the probability of one coin coming up heads and one coin coming up tails? This outcome can be\nachieved by two cases: the penny may be heads (PH) and the quarter may be tails (QT), or the quarter may be heads (QH)\nand the penny may be tails (PT). Either case fulfills the outcome. By the sum rule, we calculate the probability of obtaining\none head and one tail as [(PH) \u00d7 (QT)] + [(QH) \u00d7 (PT)] = [(1/2) \u00d7 (1/2)] + [(1/2) \u00d7 (1/2)] = 1/2 (Table 12.3). You should also\nnotice that we used the product rule to calculate the probability of PH and QT, and also the probability of PT and QH, before\nwe summed them. Again, the sum rule can be applied to show the probability of having just one dominant trait in the F2\ngeneration of a dihybrid cross:\n3\n16 +  3\n4 =  15\n16\nThe Product Rule and Sum Rule\nProduct Rule\nSum Rule\nFor independent events A and B, the probability (P)\nof them both occurring (A and B) is (PA \u00d7 PB)\nFor mutually exclusive events A and B, the probability\n(P) that at least one occurs (A or B) is (PA + PB)\nTable 12.3\nTo use probability laws in practice, it is necessary to work with large sample sizes because small sample sizes are prone\nto deviations caused by chance. The large quantities of pea plants that Mendel examined allowed him calculate the\nprobabilities of the traits appearing in his F2 generation. As you will learn, this discovery meant that when parental traits\nwere known, the offspring\u2019s traits could be predicted accurately even before fertilization.\n476\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\n12.2 | Characteristics and Traits\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat is the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes in dominant and recessive gene systems?\n\u2022\nHow can a Punnett square be used to calculate expected proportions of genotypes and phenotypes in a monohybrid\ncross?\n\u2022\nHow do phenomena such as incomplete dominance, codominance, recessive lethals, multiple alleles, and sex\nlinkage explain deviations from Mendel\u2019s model of inheritance?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe characteristics that Mendel evaluated in his pea plants were each expressed as one of two versions, or traits (e.g., green\npeas versus yellow peas).

The genetic makeup of peas\nconsists of two similar, or homologous (remember this term from Chapter 11), copies of each chromosome, one from each\nparent. Through meiosis, diploid organisms utilize meiosis to produce haploid (1n) gametes that participate in fertilization.\nFor cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic, such as pea color, a diploid organism has genetic copies\nthat may or may not encode the same version of the characteristic. These gene variations (e.g., green peas versus yellow\npeas) are called alleles.\nDifferent alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism interact to express physical characteristics such as pea color in plants\nor hairline appearance in humans. The observable traits of an organism are referred to as its phenotype. The organism\u2019s\nunderlying genetic makeup, i.e., the combination of alleles, is called its genotype. When diploid organisms carry the same\nalleles for a given trait, they are said to be homozygous for the genotype; when they carry different alleles, they are said\nto be heterozygous. For a gene whose expression is Mendelian (Section 12.1), homozygous dominant and heterozygous\norganisms will look identical; that is, they will have different genotypes but the same phenotype. The recessive allele will\nonly be observed in homozygous recessive individuals.\nHowever, alleles do not always behave in dominant and recessive patterns. In other words, there are exceptions to\nMendel\u2019s model of inheritance. For example, incomplete dominance describes situation in which the heterozygote exhibits\na phenotype that is intermediate between the homozygous phenotypes (e.g., a pink-flowered offspring is produced from a\ncross between a red-flowered parent and a white-flowered parent). Codominance describes the simultaneous expression of\nboth of the alleles in the heterozygote (e.g., human blood types). It is also common for more than two alleles of a gene\nto exist in a population (e.g., variations in sizes of pumpkins). In humans, as in many animals and some plants, females\nhave two X chromosomes, and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Genes on the X chromosome are\nX-linked, and males inherit and express only one allele for the gene (e.g., hemophilia, color-blindness). Some alleles can\nalso be lethal, so their phenotype will never be observed.\nMany human genetic disorders, including albinism, cystic fibrosis, and Huntington\u2019s disease can be explained on the basis\nof simple Mendelian inheritance patterns created by pedigree analysis.

        "summary": "In the mid-19th century, Gregor Mendel conducted groundbreaking experiments with nearly 30,000 garden pea plants to understand inheritance. Using true-breeding plants with distinct, discontinuous traits, he performed controlled crosses and observed that certain traits (dominant) consistently appeared in the first filial generation (F1), while others (recessive) disappeared but re-emerged in the second generation (F2) in a consistent 3:1 ratio. His work refuted the blending theory of inheritance, showing instead that traits are passed as discrete units, with organisms carrying two copies of each trait and passing one to offspring. Mendel demonstrated that traits are inherited independently and applied mathematical analysis, recognizing that genetic crosses follow the laws of probability. He used the product rule (for the likelihood of two independent events occurring together) and the sum rule (for mutually exclusive events) to predict trait ratios in offspring, emphasizing the importance of large sample sizes for accurate probability-based predictions in genetics."

Diploid\norganisms utilize meiosis to produce haploid gametes, which contain one copy of each homologous chromosome that unite\n478\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nat fertilization to create a diploid zygote.\nFor cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic, a diploid organism has two genetic copies that may or\nmay not encode the same version of that characteristic. Gene variants that arise by mutation and exist at the same relative\nlocations on homologous chromosomes are called alleles. Mendel examined the inheritance of genes with just two allele\nforms, but it is common to encounter more than two alleles for any given gene in a natural population.\nPhenotypes and Genotypes\nTwo alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics. The\nobservable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its phenotype. An organism\u2019s underlying genetic makeup,\nconsisting of both physically visible and non-expressed alleles, is called its genotype. Mendel\u2019s hybridization experiments\ndemonstrate the difference between phenotype and genotype. When true-breeding plants in which one parent had yellow\npods and one had green pods were cross-fertilized, all of the F1 hybrid offspring had yellow pods. That is, the hybrid\noffspring were phenotypically identical to the true-breeding parent with yellow pods. However, we know that the allele\ndonated by the parent with green pods was not simply lost because it reappeared in some of the F2 offspring. Therefore, the\nF1 plants must have been genotypically different from the parent with yellow pods.\nThe P1 plants that Mendel used in his experiments were each homozygous for the trait he was studying. Diploid organisms\nthat are homozygous at a given gene, or locus, have two identical alleles for that gene on their homologous chromosomes.\nMendel\u2019s parental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait. When P1 plants\nwith contrasting traits were cross-fertilized, all of the offspring were heterozygous for the contrasting trait, meaning that\ntheir genotype reflected that they had different alleles for the gene being examined.\nDominant and Recessive Alleles\nOur discussion of homozygous and heterozygous organisms brings us to why the F1 heterozygous offspring were identical\nto one of the parents, rather than expressing both alleles. In all seven pea-plant characteristics, one of the two contrasting\nalleles was dominant, and the other was recessive. Mendel called the dominant allele the expressed unit factor; the recessive\nallele was referred to as the latent unit factor. We now know that these so-called unit factors are actually genes on\nhomologous chromosome pairs. For a gene that is expressed in a dominant and recessive pattern, homozygous dominant\nand heterozygous organisms will look identical (that is, they will have different genotypes but the same phenotype).

For example, violet is the dominant trait for a pea\nplant\u2019s flower color, so the flower-color gene would be abbreviated as V (note that it is customary to italicize gene\ndesignations). Furthermore, we will use uppercase and lowercase letters to represent dominant and recessive alleles,\nrespectively. Therefore, we would refer to the genotype of a homozygous dominant pea plant with violet flowers as VV, a\nhomozygous recessive pea plant with white flowers as vv, and a heterozygous pea plant with violet flowers as Vv.\nThe Punnett Square Approach for a Monohybrid Cross\nWhen fertilization occurs between two true-breeding parents that differ in only one characteristic, the process is called a\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\n479\nmonohybrid cross, and the resulting offspring are monohybrids. Mendel performed seven monohybrid crosses involving\ncontrasting traits for each characteristic. On the basis of his results in F1 and F2 generations, Mendel postulated that each\nparent in the monohybrid cross contributed one of two paired unit factors to each offspring, and every possible combination\nof unit factors was equally likely.\nTo demonstrate a monohybrid cross, consider the case of true-breeding pea plants with yellow versus green pea seeds.\nThe dominant seed color is yellow; therefore, the parental genotypes were YY for the plants with yellow seeds and yy for\nthe plants with green seeds, respectively. A Punnett square, devised by the British geneticist Reginald Punnett, can be\ndrawn that applies the rules of probability to predict the possible outcomes of a genetic cross or mating and their expected\nfrequencies. To prepare a Punnett square, all possible combinations of the parental alleles are listed along the top (for one\nparent) and side (for the other parent) of a grid, representing their meiotic segregation into haploid gametes. Then the\ncombinations of egg and sperm are made in the boxes in the table to show which alleles are combining. Each box then\nrepresents the diploid genotype of a zygote, or fertilized egg, that could result from this mating. Because each possibility\nis equally likely, genotypic ratios can be determined from a Punnett square. If the pattern of inheritance (dominant or\nrecessive) is known, the phenotypic ratios can be inferred as well. For a monohybrid cross of two true-breeding parents,\neach parent contributes one type of allele. In this case, only one genotype is possible. All offspring are Yy and have yellow\nseeds (Figure 12.4).\nFigure 12.4 In the P generation, pea plants that are true-breeding for the dominant yellow phenotype are crossed with\nplants with the recessive green phenotype. This cross produces F1 heterozygotes with a yellow phenotype. Punnett\nsquare analysis can be used to predict the genotypes of the F2 generation.\nA self-cross of one of the Yy heterozygous offspring can be represented in a 2 \u00d7 2 Punnett square because each parent\ncan donate one of two different alleles. Therefore, the offspring can potentially have one of four allele combinations: YY,\nYy, yY, or yy (Figure 12.4). Notice that there are two ways to obtain the Yy genotype: a Y from the egg and a y from the\nsperm, or a y from the egg and a Y from the sperm. Both of these possibilities must be counted. Recall that Mendel\u2019s pea-\nplant characteristics behaved in the same way in reciprocal crosses. Therefore, the two possible heterozygous combinations\nproduce offspring that are genotypically and phenotypically identical despite their dominant and recessive alleles deriving\n480\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nfrom different parents. They are grouped together. Because fertilization is a random event, we expect each combination to\nbe equally likely and for the offspring to exhibit a ratio of YY:Yy:yy genotypes of 1:2:1 (Figure 12.4). Furthermore, because\nthe YY and Yy offspring have yellow seeds and are phenotypically identical, applying the sum rule of probability, we expect\nthe offspring to exhibit a phenotypic ratio of 3 yellow:1 green. Indeed, working with large sample sizes, Mendel observed\napproximately this ratio in every F2 generation resulting from crosses for individual traits.\nMendel validated these results by performing an F3 cross in which he self-crossed the dominant- and recessive-expressing\nF2 plants. When he self-crossed the plants expressing green seeds, all of the offspring had green seeds, confirming that all\ngreen seeds had homozygous genotypes of yy. When he self-crossed the F2 plants expressing yellow seeds, he found that\none-third of the plants bred true, and two-thirds of the plants segregated at a 3:1 ratio of yellow:green seeds. In this case,\nthe true-breeding plants had homozygous (YY) genotypes, whereas the segregating plants corresponded to the heterozygous\n(Yy) genotype. When these plants self-fertilized, the outcome was just like the F1 self-fertilizing cross.\nThe Test Cross Distinguishes the Dominant Phenotype\nBeyond predicting the offspring of a cross between known homozygous or heterozygous parents, Mendel also developed\na way to determine whether an organism that expressed a dominant trait was a heterozygote or a homozygote. Called the\ntest cross, this technique is still used by plant and animal breeders. In a test cross, the dominant-expressing organism is\ncrossed with an organism that is homozygous recessive for the same characteristic. If the dominant-expressing organism\nis a homozygote, then all F1 offspring will be heterozygotes expressing the dominant trait (Figure 12.5). Alternatively, if\nthe dominant expressing organism is a heterozygote, the F1 offspring will exhibit a 1:1 ratio of heterozygotes and recessive\nhomozygotes (Figure 12.5). The test cross further validates Mendel\u2019s postulate that pairs of unit factors segregate equally.\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\n481\nFigure 12.5 A test cross can be performed to determine whether an organism expressing a dominant trait is a\nhomozygote or a heterozygote.\nIn pea plants, round peas (R) are dominant to wrinkled peas (r).You do a test cross between a pea plant with wrinkled\npeas (genotype rr) and a plant of unknown genotype that has round peas. You end up with three plants, all which have\nround peas. From this data, can you tell if the round pea parent plant is homozygous dominant or heterozygous?

A healthy person in a family in which some members suffer from a recessive\ngenetic disorder may want to know if he or she has the disease-causing gene and what risk exists of passing the disorder on\nto his or her offspring. Of course, doing a test cross in humans is unethical and impractical. Instead, geneticists use pedigree\n482\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nanalysis to study the inheritance pattern of human genetic diseases (Figure 12.6).\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\n483\nFigure 12.6 Alkaptonuria is a recessive genetic disorder in which two amino acids, phenylalanine and tyrosine,\nare not properly metabolized.

Note that it is often\npossible to determine a person\u2019s genotype from the genotype of their offspring. For example, if neither parent has\nthe disorder but their child does, they must be heterozygous. Two individuals on the pedigree have an unaffected\nphenotype but unknown genotype. Because they do not have the disorder, they must have at least one normal\nallele, so their genotype gets the \u201cA?\u201d designation.\n484\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nUsing the pedigree above, what are the genotypes of the individuals labeled 1, 2 and 3?\na.\n1- aa , 2-AA, 3- AA\nb.\n1-aa, 2-Aa, 3- Aa\nc.\n1-aa, 2-Aa, 3-AA\nd.\n1-Aa, 2-Aa, 3-Aa\nAlternatives to Dominance and Recessiveness\nMendel\u2019s experiments with pea plants suggested that: (1) two \u201cunits\u201d or alleles exist for every gene; (2) alleles maintain\ntheir integrity in each generation (no blending); and (3) in the presence of the dominant allele, the recessive allele is hidden\nand makes no contribution to the phenotype. Therefore, recessive alleles can be \u201ccarried\u201d and not expressed by individuals.\nSuch heterozygous individuals are sometimes referred to as \u201ccarriers.\u201d Further genetic studies in other plants and animals\nhave shown that much more complexity exists, but that the fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics still hold true. In\nthe sections to follow, we consider some of the extensions of Mendelism. If Mendel had chosen an experimental system that\nexhibited these genetic complexities, it\u2019s possible that he would not have understood what his results meant.\nIncomplete Dominance\nMendel\u2019s results, that traits are inherited as dominant and recessive pairs, contradicted the view at that time that offspring\nexhibited a blend of their parents\u2019 traits. However, the heterozygote phenotype occasionally does appear to be intermediate\nbetween the two parents. For example, in the snapdragon, Antirrhinum majus (Figure 12.7), a cross between a homozygous\nparent with white flowers (CWCW) and a homozygous parent with red flowers (CRCR) will produce offspring with pink\nflowers (CRCW). (Note that different genotypic abbreviations are used for Mendelian extensions to distinguish these patterns\nfrom simple dominance and recessiveness.) This pattern of inheritance is described as incomplete dominance, denoting\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\n485\nthe expression of two contrasting alleles such that the individual displays an intermediate phenotype. The allele for red\nflowers is incompletely dominant over the allele for white flowers. However, the results of a heterozygote self-cross can still\nbe predicted, just as with Mendelian dominant and recessive crosses. In this case, the genotypic ratio would be 1 CRCR:2\nCRCW:1 CWCW, and the phenotypic ratio would be 1:2:1 for red:pink:white.\nFigure 12.7 These pink flowers of a heterozygote snapdragon result from incomplete dominance. (credit:\n\u201cstorebukkebruse\u201d/Flickr)\nCodominance\nA variation on incomplete dominance is codominance, in which both alleles for the same characteristic are simultaneously\nexpressed in the heterozygote. An example of codominance is the MN blood groups of humans. The M and N alleles\nare expressed in the form of an M or N antigen present on the surface of red blood cells. Homozygotes (LMLM and\nLNLN) express either the M or the N allele, and heterozygotes (LMLN) express both alleles equally. In a self-cross between\nheterozygotes expressing a codominant trait, the three possible offspring genotypes are phenotypically distinct. However,\nthe 1:2:1 genotypic ratio characteristic of a Mendelian monohybrid cross still applies.\nMultiple Alleles\nMendel implied that only two alleles, one dominant and one recessive, could exist for a given gene. We now know that this\nis an oversimplification. Although individual humans (and all diploid organisms) can only have two alleles for a given gene,\nmultiple alleles may exist at the population level such that many combinations of two alleles are observed. Note that when\nmany alleles exist for the same gene, the convention is to denote the most common phenotype or genotype among wild\nanimals as the wild type (often abbreviated \u201c+\u201d); this is considered the standard or norm. All other phenotypes or genotypes\nare considered variants of this standard, meaning that they deviate from the wild type. The variant may be recessive or\ndominant to the wild-type allele.\nAn example of multiple alleles is coat color in rabbits (Figure 12.8). Here, four alleles exist for the c gene. The wild-type\nversion, C+C+, is expressed as brown fur. The chinchilla phenotype, cchcch, is expressed as black-tipped white fur. The\nHimalayan phenotype, chch, has black fur on the extremities and white fur elsewhere. Finally, the albino, or \u201ccolorless\u201d\nphenotype, cc, is expressed as white fur. In cases of multiple alleles, dominance hierarchies can exist. In this case, the wild-\ntype allele is dominant over all the others, chinchilla is incompletely dominant over Himalayan and albino, and Himalayan\nis dominant over albino. This hierarchy, or allelic series, was revealed by observing the phenotypes of each possible\nheterozygote offspring.\n486\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 12.8 Four different alleles exist for the rabbit coat color (C) gene.\nThe complete dominance of a wild-type phenotype over all other mutants often occurs as an effect of \u201cdosage\u201d of a specific\ngene product, such that the wild-type allele supplies the correct amount of gene product whereas the mutant alleles cannot.\nFor the allelic series in rabbits, the wild-type allele may supply a given dosage of fur pigment, whereas the mutants supply\na lesser dosage or none at all. Interestingly, the Himalayan phenotype is the result of an allele that produces a temperature-\nsensitive gene product that only produces pigment in the cooler extremities of the rabbit\u2019s body.\nAlternatively, one mutant allele can be dominant over all other phenotypes, including the wild type. This may occur when\nthe mutant allele somehow interferes with the genetic message so that even a heterozygote with one wild-type allele copy\nexpresses the mutant phenotype. One way in which the mutant allele can interfere is by enhancing the function of the wild-\ntype gene product or changing its distribution in the body. One example of this is the Antennapedia mutation in Drosophila\n(Figure 12.9). In this case, the mutant allele expands the distribution of the gene product, and as a result, the Antennapedia\nheterozygote develops legs on its head where its antennae should be.\nFigure 12.9 As seen in comparing the wild-type Drosophila (left) and the Antennapedia mutant (right), the\nAntennapedia mutant has legs on its head in place of antennae.\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\n487\nMultiple Alleles Confer Drug Resistance in the Malaria Parasite\nMalaria is a parasitic disease in humans that is transmitted by infected female mosquitoes, including\nAnopheles gambiae (Figure 12.10a), and is characterized by cyclic high fevers, chills, flu-like symptoms,\nand severe anemia. Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax are the most common causative agents of malaria,\nand P. falciparum is the most deadly (Figure 12.10b). When promptly and correctly treated, P. falciparum\nmalaria has a mortality rate of 0.1 percent. However, in some parts of the world, the parasite has evolved\nresistance to commonly used malaria treatments, so the most effective malarial treatments can vary by\ngeographic region.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 12.10 The (a) Anopheles gambiae, or African malaria mosquito, acts as a vector in the transmission to\nhumans of the malaria-causing parasite (b) Plasmodium falciparum, here visualized using false-color transmission\nelectron microscopy. (credit a: James D. Gathany; credit b: Ute Frevert; false color by Margaret Shear; scale-bar\ndata from Matt Russell)\nIn Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America, P. falciparum has developed resistance to the anti-malarial\ndrugs chloroquine, mefloquine, and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. P. falciparum, which is haploid during the\nlife stage in which it is infectious to humans, has evolved multiple drug-resistant mutant alleles of the dhps\ngene. Varying degrees of sulfadoxine resistance are associated with each of these alleles. Being haploid, P.\nfalciparum needs only one drug-resistant allele to express this trait.\nIn Southeast Asia, different sulfadoxine-resistant alleles of the dhps gene are localized to different\ngeographic regions. This is a common evolutionary phenomenon that occurs because drug-resistant\nmutants arise in a population and interbreed with other P. falciparum isolates in close proximity. Sulfadoxine-\nresistant parasites cause considerable human hardship in regions where this drug is widely used as an\nover-the-counter malaria remedy. As is common with pathogens that multiply to large numbers within an\ninfection cycle, P. falciparum evolves relatively rapidly (over a decade or so) in response to the selective\npressure of commonly used anti-malarial drugs. For this reason, scientists must constantly work to develop\nnew drugs or drug combinations to combat the worldwide malaria burden.\n[2]\nAccording to this passage, why does P. falciparum only need one drug-resistant dhps allele to express the drug\nresistance trait?\na.\nThe drug-resistant dhps allele is co-dominant with the wild type allele.\nb.\nOnly one dhps allele is present during all stages of the P. falciparum life cycle.\nc.\nOnly one dhps allele is present when P. falciparum is infectious.\nd.\nThe drug-resistant dhps allele prevents the wild type allele from being expressed.\n2.\nSumiti Vinayak, et al., \u201cOrigin and Evolution of Sulfadoxine Resistant Plasmodium falciparum,\u201d Public Library of Science Pathogens 6, no. 3 (2010): e1000830,\ndoi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000830.\n488\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nX-Linked Traits\nIn humans, as well as in many other animals and some plants, the sex of the individual is determined by sex chromosomes.\nThe sex chromosomes are one pair of non-homologous chromosomes. Until now, we have only considered inheritance\npatterns among non-sex chromosomes, or autosomes. In addition to 22 homologous pairs of autosomes, human females\nhave a homologous pair of X chromosomes, whereas human males have an XY chromosome pair. Although the Y\nchromosome contains a small region of similarity to the X chromosome so that they can pair during meiosis, the\nY chromosome is much shorter and contains many fewer genes. When a gene being examined is present on the X\nchromosome, but not on the Y chromosome, it is said to be X-linked.\nEye color in Drosophila was one of the first X-linked traits to be identified. Thomas Hunt Morgan mapped this trait to the\nX chromosome in 1910. Like humans, Drosophila males have an XY chromosome pair, and females are XX. In flies, the\nwild-type eye color is red (XW) and it is dominant to white eye color (Xw) (Figure 12.11). Because of the location of the\neye-color gene, reciprocal crosses do not produce the same offspring ratios. Males are said to be hemizygous, because they\nhave only one allele for any X-linked characteristic. Hemizygosity makes the descriptions of dominance and recessiveness\nirrelevant for XY males. Drosophila males lack a second allele copy on the Y chromosome; that is, their genotype can only\nbe XWY or XwY. In contrast, females have two allele copies of this gene and can be XWXW, XWXw, or XwXw.\nFigure 12.11 In Drosophila, several genes determine eye color. The genes for white and vermilion eye colors are\nlocated on the X chromosome. Others are located on the autosomes. Clockwise from top left are brown, cinnabar,\nsepia, vermilion, white, and red. Red eye color is wild-type and is dominant to white eye color.\nIn an X-linked cross, the genotypes of F1 and F2 offspring depend on whether the recessive trait was expressed by the male\nor the female in the P1 generation. With regard to Drosophila eye color, when the P1 male expresses the white-eye phenotype\nand the female is homozygous red-eyed, all members of the F1 generation exhibit red eyes (Figure 12.12). The F1 females\nare heterozygous (XWXw), and the males are all XWY, having received their X chromosome from the homozygous dominant\nP1 female and their Y chromosome from the P1 male. A subsequent cross between the XWXw female and the XWY male\nwould produce only red-eyed females (with XWXW or XWXw genotypes) and both red- and white-eyed males (with XWY\nor XwY genotypes). Now, consider a cross between a homozygous white-eyed female and a male with red eyes. The F1\ngeneration would exhibit only heterozygous red-eyed females (XWXw) and only white-eyed males (XwY). Half of the F2\nfemales would be red-eyed (XWXw) and half would be white-eyed (XwXw). Similarly, half of the F2 males would be red-\neyed (XWY) and half would be white-eyed (XwY).\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\n489\nFigure 12.12 Punnett square analysis is used to determine the ratio of offspring from a cross between a red-eyed\nmale fruit fly and a white-eyed female fruit fly.\nWhat ratio of offspring would result from a cross between a white-eyed male fruit fly and a female fruit fly that is\nheterozygous for red eye color?\na.\n25% of the offspring are males and hemizygous dominant with red eyes and 25% are male and hemizygous\nrecessive with white eyes. 25% are female and heterozygous with red eyes and 25% are females and\nhomozygous recessive with white eyes.\nb.\n50% of the offspring are male and hemizygous dominant with red eyes and 50% are male hemizygous\nrecessive with white eyes. 50% are female and heterozygous with red eyes and 50% are female and\nhomozygous recessive with white eyes.\nc.\n25% of the males are hemizygous dominant with red eyes and 50% of the male are hemizygous recessive\nwith white eyes. 25% females are heterozygous with red eyes and 50% of the females are homozygous\nwith white eyes.\nd.\n50% of the males are hemizygous dominant with red eyes and 25% of the male are hemizygous recessive\nwith white eyes. 50% females are heterozygous with red eyes and 25% of the females are homozygous\nrecessive with white eyes\nDiscoveries in fruit fly genetics can be applied to human genetics. When a female parent is homozygous for a recessive X-\nlinked trait, she will pass the trait on to 100 percent of her offspring. Her male offspring are, therefore, destined to express\nthe trait, as they will inherit their father's Y chromosome. In humans, the alleles for certain conditions (some forms of color\nblindness, hemophilia, and muscular dystrophy) are X-linked. Females who are heterozygous for these diseases are said to\nbe carriers and may not exhibit any phenotypic effects. These females will pass the disease to half of their sons and will pass\n490\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\ncarrier status to half of their daughters; therefore, recessive X-linked traits appear more frequently in males than females.\nIn some groups of organisms with sex chromosomes, the sex with the non-homologous sex chromosomes is the female\nrather than the male. This is the case for all birds. In this case, sex-linked traits will be more likely to appear in the female,\nin which they are hemizygous.\nHuman Sex-linked Disorders\nSex-linkage studies in Morgan\u2019s laboratory provided the fundamentals for understanding X-linked recessive disorders in\nhumans, which include red-green color blindness, and Types A and B hemophilia. Because human males need to inherit only\none recessive mutant X allele to be affected, X-linked disorders are disproportionately observed in males. Females must\ninherit recessive X-linked alleles from both of their parents in order to express the trait. When they inherit one recessive\nX-linked mutant allele and one dominant X-linked wild-type allele, they are carriers of the trait and are typically unaffected.\nCarrier females can manifest mild forms of the trait due to the inactivation of the dominant allele located on one of the X\nchromosomes. However, female carriers can contribute the trait to their sons, resulting in the son exhibiting the trait, or they\ncan contribute the recessive allele to their daughters, resulting in the daughters being carriers of the trait (Figure 12.13).\nAlthough some Y-linked recessive disorders exist, typically they are associated with infertility in males and are therefore\nnot transmitted to subsequent generations.\nFigure 12.13 The son of a woman who is a carrier of a recessive X-linked disorder will have a 50 percent chance of\nbeing affected. A daughter will not be affected, but she will have a 50 percent chance of being a carrier like her mother.\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\n491\nWatch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/sex-linked_trts) to learn more about sex-linked traits.\nThe most common form of hemophilia affects 1 out of every 5,000 male births worldwide, but the condition is much\nrarer in females. Explain why this is the case.\na.\nFemales need two mutated X chromosomes to be hemophilic.\nb.\nFemales need one mutated X chromosome to be hemophilic.\nc.\nFemales do not inherit mutated X chromosomes.\nd.\nFemales need two mutated X chromosomes to not be hemophilic.\nLethality\nA large proportion of genes in an individual\u2019s genome are essential for survival. Occasionally, a nonfunctional allele for an\nessential gene can arise by mutation and be transmitted in a population as long as individuals with this allele also have a\nwild-type, functional copy. The wild-type allele functions at a capacity sufficient to sustain life and is therefore considered\nto be dominant over the nonfunctional allele. However, consider two heterozygous parents that have a genotype of wild-\ntype/nonfunctional mutant for a hypothetical essential gene. In one quarter of their offspring, we would expect to observe\nindividuals that are homozygous recessive for the nonfunctional allele. Because the gene is essential, these individuals\nmight fail to develop past fertilization, die in utero, or die later in life, depending on what life stage requires this gene. An\ninheritance pattern in which an allele is only lethal in the homozygous form and in which the heterozygote may be normal\nor have some altered non-lethal phenotype is referred to as recessive lethal.\nFor crosses between heterozygous individuals with a recessive lethal allele that causes death before birth when homozygous,\nonly wild-type homozygotes and heterozygotes would be observed. The genotypic ratio would therefore be 2:1. In other\ninstances, the recessive lethal allele might also exhibit a dominant (but not lethal) phenotype in the heterozygote. For\ninstance, the recessive lethal Curly allele in Drosophila affects wing shape in the heterozygote form but is lethal in the\nhomozygote.\nA single copy of the wild-type allele is not always sufficient for normal functioning or even survival. The dominant lethal\ninheritance pattern is one in which an allele is lethal both in the homozygote and the heterozygote; this allele can only be\ntransmitted if the lethality phenotype occurs after reproductive age. Individuals with mutations that result in dominant lethal\nalleles fail to survive even in the heterozygote form. Dominant lethal alleles are very rare because, as you might expect, the\nallele only lasts one generation and is not transmitted. However, just as the recessive lethal allele might not immediately\nmanifest the phenotype of death, dominant lethal alleles also might not be expressed until adulthood. Once the individual\nreaches reproductive age, the allele may be unknowingly passed on, resulting in a delayed death in both generations. An\nexample of this in humans is Huntington\u2019s disease, in which the nervous system gradually wastes away (Figure 12.14).\nPeople who are heterozygous for the dominant Huntington allele (Hh) will inevitably develop the fatal disease. However,\nthe onset of Huntington\u2019s disease may not occur until age 40, at which point the afflicted persons may have already passed\nthe allele to 50 percent of their offspring.\n492\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 12.14 The neuron in the center of this micrograph (yellow) has nuclear inclusions characteristic of Huntington\u2019s\ndisease (orange area in the center of the neuron).

        "summary": "The section \u201cCharacteristics and Traits\u201d explains that physical characteristics (phenotypes) are determined by the expression of genes, which exist in variant forms called alleles, carried on homologous chromosomes in diploid organisms. Genotypes describe the allele combinations, which can be homozygous or heterozygous, and in Mendelian traits, dominant alleles mask recessive ones except in homozygous recessive individuals. Mendel\u2019s monohybrid crosses, analyzed with Punnett squares, reveal predictable genotype and phenotype ratios, and test crosses can determine if a dominant-appearing organism is homozygous or heterozygous. Exceptions to simple dominance include incomplete dominance (intermediate phenotypes), codominance (simultaneous expression of both alleles), multiple alleles with dominance hierarchies, X-linked inheritance (hemizygosity in males leading to distinct patterns), and lethal alleles, which can be recessive or dominant depending on when lethality occurs. These principles explain not only traits in plants and animals but also human genetic disorders, with pedigree analysis used to study inheritance where experimental crosses are not possible."

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 3.11][APLO 3.15][APLO 3.14][APLO 3.17][APLO 3.12]\nMendel generalized the results of his pea-plant experiments into four postulates, some of which are sometimes called\n\u201claws,\u201d that describe the basis of dominant and recessive inheritance in diploid organisms. As you have learned, more\ncomplex extensions of Mendelism exist that do not exhibit the same F2 phenotypic ratios (3:1). Nevertheless, these laws\nsummarize the basics of classical genetics.\nPairs of Unit Factors, or Genes\nMendel proposed first that paired unit factors of heredity were transmitted faithfully from generation to generation by the\ndissociation and reassociation of paired factors during gametogenesis and fertilization, respectively. After he crossed peas\nwith contrasting traits and found that the recessive trait resurfaced in the F2 generation, Mendel deduced that hereditary\nfactors must be inherited as discrete units. This finding contradicted the belief at that time that parental traits were blended\nin the offspring.\nAlleles Can Be Dominant or Recessive\nMendel\u2019s law of dominance states that in a heterozygote, one trait will conceal the presence of another trait for the same\ncharacteristic. Rather than both alleles contributing to a phenotype, the dominant allele will be expressed exclusively. The\nrecessive allele will remain \u201clatent\u201d but will be transmitted to offspring by the same manner in which the dominant allele is\ntransmitted. The recessive trait will only be expressed by offspring that have two copies of this allele (Figure 12.15), and\nthese offspring will breed true when self-crossed.\nSince Mendel\u2019s experiments with pea plants, other researchers have found that the law of dominance does not always hold\ntrue. Instead, several different patterns of inheritance have been found to exist.\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\n495\nFigure 12.15 The child in the photo expresses albinism, a recessive trait.\nEqual Segregation of Alleles\nObserving that true-breeding pea plants with contrasting traits gave rise to F1 generations that all expressed the dominant\ntrait and F2 generations that expressed the dominant and recessive traits in a 3:1 ratio, Mendel proposed the law of\nsegregation. This law states that paired unit factors (genes) must segregate equally into gametes such that offspring\nhave an equal likelihood of inheriting either factor. For the F2 generation of a monohybrid cross, the following three\npossible combinations of genotypes could result: homozygous dominant, heterozygous, or homozygous recessive. Because\nheterozygotes could arise from two different pathways (receiving one dominant and one recessive allele from either parent),\nand because heterozygotes and homozygous dominant individuals are phenotypically identical, the law supports Mendel\u2019s\nobserved 3:1 phenotypic ratio. The equal segregation of alleles is the reason we can apply the Punnett square to accurately\npredict the offspring of parents with known genotypes. The physical basis of Mendel\u2019s law of segregation is the first division\nof meiosis, in which the homologous chromosomes with their different versions of each gene are segregated into daughter\nnuclei. The role of the meiotic segregation of chromosomes in sexual reproduction was not understood by the scientific\ncommunity during Mendel\u2019s lifetime.\nIndependent Assortment\nMendel\u2019s law of independent assortment states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the sorting of\nalleles into gametes, and every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur. The independent\nassortment of genes can be illustrated by the dihybrid cross, a cross between two true-breeding parents that express\ndifferent traits for two characteristics. Consider the characteristics of seed color and seed texture for two pea plants, one that\nhas green, wrinkled seeds (yyrr) and another that has yellow, round seeds (YYRR). Because each parent is homozygous, the\nlaw of segregation indicates that the gametes for the green/wrinkled plant all are yr, and the gametes for the yellow/round\nplant are all YR. Therefore, the F1 generation of offspring all are YyRr (Figure 12.16).\n496\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 12.16 This dihybrid cross of pea plants involves the genes for seed color and texture.\nIn pea plants, purple flowers (P) are dominant to white flowers (p) and yellow peas (Y) are dominant to green peas\n(y).

The law of independent assortment states that a gamete into which an r allele sorted would\nbe equally likely to contain either a Y allele or a y allele. Thus, there are four equally likely gametes that can be formed\nwhen the YyRr heterozygote is self-crossed, as follows: YR, Yr, yR, and yr. Arranging these gametes along the top and left\nof a 4 \u00d7 4 Punnett square (Figure 12.16) gives us 16 equally likely genotypic combinations. From these genotypes, we\ninfer a phenotypic ratio of 9 round/yellow:3 round/green:3 wrinkled/yellow:1 wrinkled/green (Figure 12.16). These are the\noffspring ratios we would expect, assuming we performed the crosses with a large enough sample size.\nBecause of independent assortment and dominance, the 9:3:3:1 dihybrid phenotypic ratio can be collapsed into two 3:1\nratios, characteristic of any monohybrid cross that follows a dominant and recessive pattern. Ignoring seed color and\nconsidering only seed texture in the above dihybrid cross, we would expect that three quarters of the F2 generation offspring\nwould be round, and one quarter would be wrinkled. Similarly, isolating only seed color, we would assume that three\nquarters of the F2 offspring would be yellow and one quarter would be green. The sorting of alleles for texture and color\nare independent events, so we can apply the product rule. Therefore, the proportion of round and yellow F2 offspring is\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\n497\nexpected to be (3/4) \u00d7 (3/4) = 9/16, and the proportion of wrinkled and green offspring is expected to be (1/4) \u00d7 (1/4) = 1/16.\nThese proportions are identical to those obtained using a Punnett square. Round, green and wrinkled, yellow offspring can\nalso be calculated using the product rule, as each of these genotypes includes one dominant and one recessive phenotype.\nTherefore, the proportion of each is calculated as (3/4) \u00d7 (1/4) = 3/16.\nThe law of independent assortment also indicates that a cross between yellow, wrinkled (YYrr) and green, round (yyRR)\nparents would yield the same F1 and F2 offspring as in the YYRR x yyrr cross.\nThe physical basis for the law of independent assortment also lies in meiosis I, in which the different homologous pairs line\nup in random orientations. Each gamete can contain any combination of paternal and maternal chromosomes (and therefore\nthe genes on them) because the orientation of tetrads on the metaphase plane is random.\nForked-Line Method\nWhen more than two genes are being considered, the Punnett-square method becomes unwieldy. For instance, examining\na cross involving four genes would require a 16 \u00d7 16 grid containing 256 boxes. It would be extremely cumbersome to\nmanually enter each genotype. For more complex crosses, the forked-line and probability methods are preferred.\nTo prepare a forked-line diagram for a cross between F1 heterozygotes resulting from a cross between AABBCC and aabbcc\nparents, we first create rows equal to the number of genes being considered, and then segregate the alleles in each row\non forked lines according to the probabilities for individual monohybrid crosses (Figure 12.17). We then multiply the\nvalues along each forked path to obtain the F2 offspring probabilities. Note that this process is a diagrammatic version of\nthe product rule. The values along each forked pathway can be multiplied because each gene assorts independently. For a\ntrihybrid cross, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 27:9:9:9:3:3:3:1.\nFigure 12.17 The forked-line method can be used to analyze a trihybrid cross. Here, the probability for color in\nthe F2 generation occupies the top row (3 yellow:1 green). The probability for shape occupies the second row (3\nround:1 wrinked), and the probability for height occupies the third row (3 tall:1 dwarf). The probability for each possible\ncombination of traits is calculated by multiplying the probability for each individual trait. Thus, the probability of F2\noffspring having yellow, round, and tall traits is 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3, or 27.\nProbability Method\nWhile the forked-line method is a diagrammatic approach to keeping track of probabilities in a cross, the probability method\ngives the proportions of offspring expected to exhibit each phenotype (or genotype) without the added visual assistance.\nBoth methods make use of the product rule and consider the alleles for each gene separately. Earlier, we examined the\nphenotypic proportions for a trihybrid cross using the forked-line method; now we will use the probability method to\nexamine the genotypic proportions for a cross with even more genes.\nFor a trihybrid cross, writing out the forked-line method is tedious, albeit not as tedious as using the Punnett-square method.\nTo fully demonstrate the power of the probability method, however, we can consider specific genetic calculations. For\ninstance, for a tetrahybrid cross between individuals that are heterozygotes for all four genes, and in which all four genes\nare sorting independently and in a dominant and recessive pattern, what proportion of the offspring will be expected to\nbe homozygous recessive for all four alleles? Rather than writing out every possible genotype, we can use the probability\nmethod. We know that for each gene, the fraction of homozygous recessive offspring will be 1/4. Therefore, multiplying this\nfraction for each of the four genes, (1/4) \u00d7 (1/4) \u00d7 (1/4) \u00d7 (1/4), we determine that 1/256 of the offspring will be quadruply\nhomozygous recessive.\nFor the same tetrahybrid cross, what is the expected proportion of offspring that have the dominant phenotype at all four\nloci? We can answer this question using phenotypic proportions, but let\u2019s do it the hard way\u2014using genotypic proportions.\nThe question asks for the proportion of offspring that are 1) homozygous dominant at A or heterozygous at A, and 2)\nhomozygous at B or heterozygous at B, and so on. Noting the \u201cor\u201d and \u201cand\u201d in each circumstance makes clear where to\n498\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\napply the sum and product rules. The probability of a homozygous dominant at A is 1/4 and the probability of a heterozygote\nat A is 1/2. The probability of the homozygote or the heterozygote is 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4 using the sum rule. The same probability\ncan be obtained in the same way for each of the other genes, so that the probability of a dominant phenotype at A and B and\nC and D is, using the product rule, equal to 3/4 \u00d7 3/4 \u00d7 3/4 \u00d7 3/4, or 27/64. If you are ever unsure about how to combine\nprobabilities, returning to the forked-line method should make it clear.\nRules for Multihybrid Fertilization\nPredicting the genotypes and phenotypes of offspring from given crosses is the best way to test your knowledge of\nMendelian genetics. Given a multihybrid cross that obeys independent assortment and follows a dominant and recessive\npattern, several generalized rules exist; you can use these rules to check your results as you work through genetics\ncalculations (Table 12.5). To apply these rules, first you must determine n, the number of heterozygous gene pairs (the\nnumber of genes segregating two alleles each). For example, a cross between AaBb and AaBb heterozygotes has an n of 2.\nIn contrast, a cross between AABb and AABb has an n of 1 because A is not heterozygous.\nGeneral Rules for Multihybrid Crosses\nGeneral Rule\nNumber of Heterozygous Gene\nPairs\nNumber of different F1 gametes\n2n\nNumber of different F2 genotypes\n3n\nGiven dominant and recessive inheritance, the number of different F2\nphenotypes\n2n\nTable 12.5\nLinked Genes Violate the Law of Independent Assortment\nAlthough all of Mendel\u2019s pea characteristics behaved according to the law of independent assortment, we now know\nthat some allele combinations are not inherited independently of each other. Genes that are located on separate non-\nhomologous chromosomes will always sort independently. However, each chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of\ngenes, organized linearly on chromosomes like beads on a string. The segregation of alleles into gametes can be influenced\nby linkage, in which genes that are located physically close to each other on the same chromosome are more likely to be\ninherited as a pair. However, because of the process of recombination, or \u201ccrossover,\u201d it is possible for two genes on the\nsame chromosome to behave independently, or as if they are not linked. To understand this, let\u2019s consider the biological\nbasis of gene linkage and recombination.\nHomologous chromosomes possess the same genes in the same linear order. The alleles may differ on homologous\nchromosome pairs, but the genes to which they correspond do not. In preparation for the first division of meiosis,\nhomologous chromosomes replicate and synapse. Like genes on the homologs align with each other. At this stage,\nsegments of homologous chromosomes exchange linear segments of genetic material (Figure 12.18). This process is called\nrecombination, or crossover, and it is a common genetic process. Because the genes are aligned during recombination, the\ngene order is not altered. Instead, the result of recombination is that maternal and paternal alleles are combined onto the\nsame chromosome. Across a given chromosome, several recombination events may occur, causing extensive shuffling of\nalleles.\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\n499\nFigure 12.18 The process of crossover, or recombination, occurs when two homologous chromosomes align during\nmeiosis and exchange a segment of genetic material. Here, the alleles for gene C were exchanged. The result is two\nrecombinant and two non-recombinant chromosomes.\nWhen two genes are located in close proximity on the same chromosome, they are considered linked, and their alleles\ntend to be transmitted through meiosis together. To exemplify this, imagine a dihybrid cross involving flower color and\nplant height in which the genes are next to each other on the chromosome. If one homologous chromosome has alleles\nfor tall plants and red flowers, and the other chromosome has genes for short plants and yellow flowers, then when the\ngametes are formed, the tall and red alleles will go together into a gamete and the short and yellow alleles will go into other\ngametes. These are called the parental genotypes because they have been inherited intact from the parents of the individual\nproducing gametes. But unlike if the genes were on different chromosomes, there will be no gametes with tall and yellow\nalleles and no gametes with short and red alleles. If you create the Punnett square with these gametes, you will see that\nthe classical Mendelian prediction of a 9:3:3:1 outcome of a dihybrid cross would not apply. As the distance between two\ngenes increases, the probability of one or more crossovers between them increases, and the genes behave more like they are\non separate chromosomes. Geneticists have used the proportion of recombinant gametes (the ones not like the parents) as\na measure of how far apart genes are on a chromosome. Using this information, they have constructed elaborate maps of\ngenes on chromosomes for well-studied organisms, including humans.\nMendel\u2019s seminal publication makes no mention of linkage, and many researchers have questioned whether he encountered\nlinkage but chose not to publish those crosses out of concern that they would invalidate his independent assortment\npostulate. The garden pea has seven chromosomes, and some have suggested that his choice of seven characteristics was\nnot a coincidence. However, even if the genes he examined were not located on separate chromosomes, it is possible that\nhe simply did not observe linkage because of the extensive shuffling effects of recombination.\nTesting the Hypothesis of Independent Assortment\nTo better appreciate the amount of labor and ingenuity that went into Mendel\u2019s experiments, proceed through one of\nMendel\u2019s dihybrid crosses.\nQuestion: What will be the offspring of a dihybrid cross?\nBackground: Consider that pea plants mature in one growing season, and you have access to a large garden in\nwhich you can cultivate thousands of pea plants. There are several true-breeding plants with the following pairs of\n500\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\ntraits: tall plants with inflated pods, and dwarf plants with constricted pods. Before the plants have matured, you\nremove the pollen-producing organs from the tall/inflated plants in your crosses to prevent self-fertilization. Upon plant\nmaturation, the plants are manually crossed by transferring pollen from the dwarf/constricted plants to the stigmata of\nthe tall/inflated plants.\nHypothesis: Both trait pairs will sort independently according to Mendelian laws. When the true-breeding parents\nare crossed, all of the F1 offspring are tall and have inflated pods, which indicates that the tall and inflated traits are\ndominant over the dwarf and constricted traits, respectively. A self-cross of the F1 heterozygotes results in 2,000 F2\nprogeny.\nTest the hypothesis: Because each trait pair sorts independently, the ratios of tall:dwarf and inflated:constricted are\neach expected to be 3:1. The tall/dwarf trait pair is called T/t, and the inflated/constricted trait pair is designated I/\ni. Each member of the F1 generation therefore has a genotype of TtIi. Construct a grid analogous to Figure 12.16,\nin which you cross two TtIi individuals. Each individual can donate four combinations of two traits: TI, Ti, tI, or ti,\nmeaning that there are 16 possibilities of offspring genotypes. Because the T and I alleles are dominant, any individual\nhaving one or two of those alleles will express the tall or inflated phenotypes, respectively, regardless if they also have\na t or i allele. Only individuals that are tt or ii will express the dwarf and constricted alleles, respectively. As shown in\nFigure 12.19, you predict that you will observe the following offspring proportions: tall/inflated:tall/constricted:dwarf/\ninflated:dwarf/constricted in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Notice from the grid that when considering the tall/dwarf and inflated/\nconstricted trait pairs in isolation, they are each inherited in 3:1 ratios.\nFigure 12.19 This figure shows all possible combinations of offspring resulting from a dihybrid cross of pea plants\nthat are heterozygous for the tall/dwarf and inflated/constricted alleles.\nTest the hypothesis: You cross the dwarf and tall plants and then self-cross the offspring. For best results, this is\nrepeated with hundreds or even thousands of pea plants. What special precautions should be taken in the crosses and\nin growing the plants?\nAnalyze your data: You observe the following plant phenotypes in the F2 generation: 2706 tall/inflated, 930 tall/\nconstricted, 888 dwarf/inflated, and 300 dwarf/constricted. Reduce these findings to a ratio and determine if they are\nconsistent with Mendelian laws.\nForm a conclusion: Were the results close to the expected 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio? Do the results support the\nprediction? What might be observed if far fewer plants were used, given that alleles segregate randomly into gametes?\nTry to imagine growing that many pea plants, and consider the potential for experimental error. For instance, what\nwould happen if it was extremely windy one day?\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\n501\nThink About It\nIn the shepherd\u2019s-purse plant (Capsella bursa-pastoris), seed shape is controlled by two genes, A and\nB. When both the A and B loci are homozygous recessive (aabb), the seeds are ovoid. However, if\nthe dominant allele for either or both of these genes is present, the seeds are triangular. Based on this\ninformation, what are the expected phenotypic ratios for a cross between plants that are heterozygous for\nboth traits?\nWhat is the expected ratio of phenotypes from a dihybrid cross? How do you explain the difference between\nthe expected dihybrid cross ratio and ratio observed in the shepherd\u2019s-purse plant?\nEpistasis\nMendel\u2019s studies in pea plants implied that the sum of an individual\u2019s phenotype was controlled by genes (or as he called\nthem, unit factors), such that every characteristic was distinctly and completely controlled by a single gene. In fact, single\nobservable characteristics are almost always under the influence of multiple genes (each with two or more alleles) acting in\nunison. For example, at least eight genes contribute to eye color in humans.\nEye color in humans is determined by multiple genes. Use the Eye Color Calculator (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/\neye_color_calc) to predict the eye color of children from parental eye color.\nA couple produces a green-eyed child. Both of the parents have brown eyes. Explain how this is genetically possible.\na.\nBoth parents are homozygous for the dominant trait of brown eyes.\nb.\nBoth parents are heterozygous, having the green trait on the green-blue eye gene.\nc.\nBoth parents are heterozygous with the recessive trait of brown eyes.\nd.\nBoth parents are homozygous having the green trait on the green-blue eye gene.\nIn some cases, several genes can contribute to aspects of a common phenotype without their gene products ever directly\ninteracting. In the case of organ development, for instance, genes may be expressed sequentially, with each gene adding to\nthe complexity and specificity of the organ. Genes may function in complementary or synergistic fashions, such that two or\nmore genes need to be expressed simultaneously to affect a phenotype. Genes may also oppose each other, with one gene\nmodifying the expression of another.\nIn epistasis, the interaction between genes is antagonistic, such that one gene masks or interferes with the expression of\nanother. \u201cEpistasis\u201d is a word composed of Greek roots that mean \u201cstanding upon.\u201d The alleles that are being masked or\nsilenced are said to be hypostatic to the epistatic alleles that are doing the masking. Often the biochemical basis of epistasis\nis a gene pathway in which the expression of one gene is dependent on the function of a gene that precedes or follows it in\nthe pathway.\nAn example of epistasis is pigmentation in mice. The wild-type coat color, agouti (AA), is dominant to solid-colored fur\n(aa). However, a separate gene (C) is necessary for pigment production. A mouse with a recessive c allele at this locus is\nunable to produce pigment and is albino regardless of the allele present at locus A (Figure 12.20). Therefore, the genotypes\nAAcc, Aacc, and aacc all produce the same albino phenotype. A cross between heterozygotes for both genes (AaCc x AaCc)\n502\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nwould generate offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 9 agouti:3 solid color:4 albino (Figure 12.20). In this case, the C gene\nis epistatic to the A gene.\nFigure 12.20 In mice, the mottled agouti coat color (A) is dominant to a solid coloration, such as black or gray. A gene\nat a separate locus (C) is responsible for pigment production. The recessive c allele does not produce pigment, and a\nmouse with the homozygous recessive cc genotype is albino regardless of the allele present at the A locus. Thus, the\nC gene is epistatic to the A gene.\nEpistasis can also occur when a dominant allele masks expression at a separate gene. Fruit color in summer squash is\nexpressed in this way. Homozygous recessive expression of the W gene (ww) coupled with homozygous dominant or\nheterozygous expression of the Y gene (YY or Yy) generates yellow fruit, and the wwyy genotype produces green fruit.\nHowever, if a dominant copy of the W gene is present in the homozygous or heterozygous form, the summer squash will\nproduce white fruit regardless of the Y alleles. A cross between white heterozygotes for both genes (WwYy \u00d7 WwYy) would\nproduce offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 12 white:3 yellow:1 green.\nFinally, epistasis can be reciprocal such that either gene, when present in the dominant (or recessive) form, expresses the\nsame phenotype. In the shepherd\u2019s purse plant (Capsella bursa-pastoris), the characteristic of seed shape is controlled by\ntwo genes in a dominant epistatic relationship. When the genes A and B are both homozygous recessive (aabb), the seeds\nare ovoid. If the dominant allele for either of these genes is present, the result is triangular seeds. That is, every possible\ngenotype other than aabb results in triangular seeds, and a cross between heterozygotes for both genes (AaBb x AaBb)\nwould yield offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 15 triangular:1 ovoid.\nAs you work through genetics problems, keep in mind that any single characteristic that results in a phenotypic ratio that\ntotals 16 is typical of a two-gene interaction. Recall the phenotypic inheritance pattern for Mendel\u2019s dihybrid cross, which\nconsidered two non-interacting genes\u20149:3:3:1. Similarly, we would expect interacting gene pairs to also exhibit ratios\nexpressed as 16 parts. Note that we are assuming the interacting genes are not linked; they are still assorting independently\ninto gametes.\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\n503\nFor an excellent review of Mendel\u2019s experiments and to perform your own crosses and identify patterns of inheritance,\nvisit the Mendel\u2019s Peas (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/mendels_peas) web lab.\nExplain how Mendel\u2019s experiments help modern-day farmers breed crops that exhibit preferred traits, like tall height\nor large fruit size.\na.\nby providing information about the variety of pea plants\nb.\nby providing information about soil condition\nc.\nby providing information about organic feritilizers\nd.\nby providing information about the inheritance of traits and the concept of dominance\n504\nChapter 12 | Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nallele\nautosomes\nblending theory of inheritance\ncodominance\ncontinuous variation\ndihybrid\ndiscontinuous variation\ndominant\ndominant lethal\nepistasis\nF1\nF2\ngenotype\nhemizygous\nheterozygous\nhomozygous\nhybridization\nincomplete dominance\nlaw of dominance\nlaw of independent assortment\nlaw of segregation\nlinkage\nmodel system\nmonohybrid\nP0\nKEY TERMS\ngene variations that arise by mutation and exist at the same relative locations on homologous chromosomes\nany of the non-sex chromosomes\nhypothetical inheritance pattern in which parental traits are blended together in the\noffspring to produce an intermediate physical appearance\nin a heterozygote, complete and simultaneous expression of both alleles for the same characteristic\ninheritance pattern in which a character shows a range of trait values with small gradations rather\nthan large gaps between them\nresult of a cross between two true-breeding parents that express different traits for two characteristics\ninheritance pattern in which traits are distinct and are transmitted independently of one another\ntrait which confers the same physical appearance whether an individual has two copies of the trait or one copy\nof the dominant trait and one copy of the recessive trait\ninheritance pattern in which an allele is lethal both in the homozygote and the heterozygote;

        "summary": "The Laws of Inheritance section explains Mendel\u2019s foundational principles of heredity, beginning with the idea that traits are determined by discrete \u201cunit factors\u201d (genes) that exist in pairs, with alleles that may be dominant or recessive. The law of segregation states that allele pairs separate equally during gamete formation, ensuring equal chances of inheritance, while the law of independent assortment states that genes for different traits are inherited independently when located on different chromosomes. These principles are demonstrated through monohybrid and dihybrid crosses, predicted by Punnett squares, probability rules, and the forked-line method; general rules help handle multihybrid crosses. However, Mendel\u2019s laws have exceptions due to linked genes, which are inherited together unless separated by recombination during meiosis, altering expected ratios. Additionally, gene interactions such as epistasis can modify phenotypic outcomes, with examples like coat color in mice and fruit color in squash, producing characteristic ratios different from standard Mendelian patterns. Overall, while Mendel established the basis for classical genetics, factors like linkage, recombination, and gene interaction demonstrate more complex inheritance patterns."

For example, scientists\nhave discovered genes that appear to increase one\u2019s tendency to exhibit aggressive behavior. One of the genes, called\nMAOA, is located on the X chromosome. In one recent study involving a group of male prisoners in Finland, scientists\nfound that the prisoners who inherited a variant of this gene were between 5% and 10% more likely to have committed a\nviolent crime. Men only have one copy of the gene, since men only have one X chromosome. Women, however, have two\ncopies of the X chromosome and therefore two copies of the gene. Therefore, women who inherit the variant allele will\nmost likely also have a normal allele to counteract its effects. It is important to note that many men inherit the variant copy\nof MAOA and only some commit violent crimes. The environment seems to play a much more critical role.

As we have discovered, patterns of inheritance are more complex than\nMendel could have imagined. Mendel was investigating the behavior of genes. He was fortunate in choosing traits coded\nby genes that happened to be on different chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome. When genes are linked or\nnear each other on the same chromosome, patterns of segregation and independent assortment change. In 1913, Sturtevant\ndevised a method to assess recombination frequency and infer the relative positions and distances of linked genes on a\nchromosome based on the average number of crossovers between them during meiosis.\nThe content presented in this section supports the Learning Objectives outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP\u00ae Biology\nCurriculum Framework.

With the improvement of microscopic techniques during the late 1800s, cell biologists could stain\nand visualize subcellular structures with dyes and observe their actions during cell division and meiosis. With each mitotic\ndivision, chromosomes replicated, condensed from an amorphous (no constant shape) nuclear mass into distinct X-shaped\nbodies (pairs of identical sister chromatids), and migrated to separate cellular poles.\n518\nChapter 13 | Modern Understandings of Inheritance\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nChromosomal Theory of Inheritance\nThe speculation that chromosomes might be the key to understanding heredity led several scientists to examine Mendel\u2019s\npublications and re-evaluate his model in terms of the behavior of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. In 1902,\nTheodor Boveri observed that proper embryonic development of sea urchins does not occur unless chromosomes are\npresent. That same year, Walter Sutton observed the separation of chromosomes into daughter cells during meiosis (Figure\n13.2). Together, these observations led to the development of the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance, which identified\nchromosomes as the genetic material responsible for Mendelian inheritance.\nFigure 13.2 (a) Walter Sutton and (b) Theodor Boveri are credited with developing the Chromosomal Theory of\nInheritance, which states that chromosomes carry the unit of heredity (genes).\nThe Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance was consistent with Mendel\u2019s laws and was supported by the following\nobservations:\n\u2022\nDuring meiosis, homologous chromosome pairs migrate as discrete structures that are independent of other\nchromosome pairs.\n\u2022\nThe sorting of chromosomes from each homologous pair into pre-gametes appears to be random.\n\u2022\nEach parent synthesizes gametes that contain only half of their chromosomal complement.\n\u2022\nEven though male and female gametes (sperm and egg) differ in size and morphology, they have the same number of\nchromosomes, suggesting equal genetic contributions from each parent.\n\u2022\nThe gametic chromosomes combine during fertilization to produce offspring with the same chromosome number as\ntheir parents.\nDespite compelling correlations between the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis and Mendel\u2019s abstract laws, the\nChromosomal Theory of Inheritance was proposed long before there was any direct evidence that traits were carried\non chromosomes. Critics pointed out that individuals had far more independently segregating traits than they had\nchromosomes. It was only after several years of carrying out crosses with the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, that\nThomas Hunt Morgan provided experimental evidence to support the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance.\nGenetic Linkage and Distances\nMendel\u2019s work suggested that traits are inherited independently of each other. Morgan identified a 1:1 correspondence\nbetween a segregating trait and the X chromosome, suggesting that the random segregation of chromosomes was the\nphysical basis of Mendel\u2019s model. This also demonstrated that linked genes disrupt Mendel\u2019s predicted outcomes. The fact\nthat each chromosome can carry many linked genes explains how individuals can have many more traits than they have\nchromosomes. However, observations by researchers in Morgan\u2019s laboratory suggested that alleles positioned on the same\nchromosome were not always inherited together. During meiosis, linked genes somehow became unlinked.\nHomologous Recombination\nIn 1909, Frans Janssen observed chiasmata\u2014the point at which chromatids are in contact with each other and may exchange\nsegments\u2014prior to the first division of meiosis. He suggested that alleles become unlinked and chromosomes physically\nexchange segments. As chromosomes condensed and paired with their homologs, they appeared to interact at distinct\npoints. Janssen suggested that these points corresponded to regions in which chromosome segments were exchanged. It\nis now known that the pairing and interaction between homologous chromosomes, known as synapsis, does more than\nChapter 13 | Modern Understandings of Inheritance\n519\nsimply organize the homologs for migration to separate daughter cells. When synapsed, homologous chromosomes undergo\nreciprocal physical exchanges at their arms in a process called homologous recombination, or more simply, \u201ccrossing\nover.\u201d\nTo better understand the type of experimental results that researchers were obtaining at this time, consider a heterozygous\nindividual that inherited dominant maternal alleles for two genes on the same chromosome (such as AB) and two recessive\npaternal alleles for those same genes (such as ab). If the genes are linked, one would expect this individual to produce\ngametes that are either AB or ab with a 1:1 ratio. If the genes are unlinked, the individual should produce AB, Ab, aB, and ab\ngametes with equal frequencies, according to the Mendelian concept of independent assortment. Because they correspond\nto new allele combinations, the genotypes Ab and aB are nonparental types that result from homologous recombination\nduring meiosis. Parental types are progeny that exhibit the same allelic combination as their parents. Morgan and his\ncolleagues, however, found that when such heterozygous individuals were test crossed to a homozygous recessive parent\n(AaBb \u00d7 aabb), both parental and nonparental cases occurred. For example, 950 offspring might be recovered that were\neither AaBb or aabb, but 50 offspring would also be obtained that were either Aabb or aaBb. These results suggested that\nlinkage occurred most often, but a significant minority of offspring were the products of recombination.\n520\nChapter 13 | Modern Understandings of Inheritance\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 13.3 Inheritance patterns of unlinked and linked genes are shown. In (a), two genes are located on\ndifferent chromosomes so independent assortment occurs during meiosis. The offspring have an equal chance\nof being the parental type (inheriting the same combination of traits as the parents) or a nonparental type\n(inheriting a different combination of traits than the parents). In (b), two genes are very close together on the\nsame chromosome so that no crossing over occurs between them. The genes are therefore always inherited\ntogether and all of the offspring are the parental type. In (c), two genes are far apart on the chromosome such that\ncrossing over occurs during every meiotic event. The recombination frequency will be the same as if the genes\nwere on separate chromosomes. (d) The actual recombination frequency of fruit fly wing length and body color\nthat Thomas Morgan observed in 1912 was 17 percent. A crossover frequency between 0 percent and 50 percent\nindicates that the genes are on the same chromosome and crossover occurs some of the time.\nIn a test cross for two characteristics such as the one shown here, can the predicted frequency of recombinant offspring\nbe 60% ? Why or why not?\na.\nYes, the predicted offspring frequencies range from 0% to 100%\nb.\nNo, the predicted offspring frequencies cannot be higher than 30% .\nc.\nYes, the predicted offspring frequencies range from 0% to 60% .\nd.\nNo, the predicted offspring frequencies range from 0% to 50% .\nChapter 13 | Modern Understandings of Inheritance\n521\nThink About It\nA test cross involving F1 dihybrid flies produces more parental-type offspring than recombinant-type offspring. How\ncan you explain these observed results?\nGenetic Markers for Cancers\nScientists have used genetic linkage to discover the location in the human genome of many genes that\ncause disease. They locate disease genes by tracking inheritance of traits through generations of families\nand creating linkage maps that measure recombination among groups of genetic \u201cmarkers.\u201d The two BRCA\ngenes, mutations which can lead to breast and ovarian cancers, were some of the first genes discovered by\ngenetic mapping. Women who have family histories of these cancers can now be screened to determine if\none or both of these genes carry a mutation. If so, they can opt to have their breasts and ovaries surgically\nremoved. This decreases their chances of getting cancer later in life. The actress Angelia Jolie brought\nthis to the public\u2019s attention when she opted for surgery in 2014 and again in 2015 after doctors found she\ncarried a mutated BRCA1 gene.\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes domestication syndrome?\na.\nGenes responsible for temperament are on the same chromosome as genes responsible for certain facial\nfeatures.\nb.\nA single gene codes for both temperament and certain facial features, such as jaw size.\nc.\nGenes responsible for mild temperament are only expressed when genes encoding a cute face are also\npresent.\nd.\nThe products of genes encoding temperament interact with the products of genes encoding facial features.\nGenetic Maps\nJanssen did not have the technology to demonstrate crossing over so it remained an abstract idea that was not widely\naccepted. Scientists thought chiasmata were a variation on synapsis and could not understand how chromosomes could\nbreak and rejoin. Yet, the data were clear that linkage did not always occur. Ultimately, it took a young undergraduate\nstudent and an \u201call-nighter\u201d to mathematically elucidate the problem of linkage and recombination.\nIn 1913, Alfred Sturtevant, a student in Morgan\u2019s laboratory, gathered results from researchers in the laboratory, and took\nthem home one night to mull them over. By the next morning, he had created the first \u201cchromosome map,\u201d a linear\nrepresentation of gene order and relative distance on a chromosome (Figure 13.4).\n522\nChapter 13 | Modern Understandings of Inheritance\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 13.4 This genetic map orders Drosophila genes on the basis of recombination frequency.\nWhich of the following statements is true?\na.\nRecombination of the red/brown eye and long/short aristae alleles will occur more frequently than\nrecombination of the alleles for wing length and body color.\nb.\nRecombination of the body color and red/cinnabar eye alleles will occur more frequently than recombination\nof the alleles for wing length and aristae length.\nc.\nRecombination of the body color and aristae length alleles will occur more frequently than recombination of\nred/brown eye alleles and the aristae length alleles.\nd.\nRecombination of the gray/black body color and long/short aristae alleles will not occur.\nAs shown in Figure 13.4, by using recombination frequency to predict genetic distance, the relative order of genes on\nchromosome 2 could be inferred. The values shown represent map distances in centimorgans (cM), which correspond to\nrecombination frequencies (in percent). Therefore, the genes for body color and wing size were 65.5 \u221248.5 = 17 cM apart,\nindicating that the maternal and paternal alleles for these genes recombine in 17 percent of offspring, on average.\nTo construct a chromosome map, Sturtevant assumed that genes were ordered serially on threadlike chromosomes. He also\nassumed that the incidence of recombination between two homologous chromosomes could occur with equal likelihood\nanywhere along the length of the chromosome. Operating under these assumptions, Sturtevant postulated that alleles\nthat were far apart on a chromosome were more likely to dissociate during meiosis simply because there was a larger\nregion over which recombination could occur. Conversely, alleles that were close to each other on the chromosome were\nlikely to be inherited together. The average number of crossovers between two alleles\u2014that is, their recombination\nfrequency\u2014correlated with their genetic distance from each other, relative to the locations of other genes on that\nchromosome. Considering the example cross between AaBb and aabb above, the frequency of recombination could be\ncalculated as 50/1000 = 0.05. That is, the likelihood of a crossover between genes A/a and B/b was 0.05, or 5 percent.\nSuch a result would indicate that the genes were definitively linked, but that they were far enough apart for crossovers to\noccasionally occur. Sturtevant divided his genetic map into map units, or centimorgans (cM), in which a recombination\nfrequency of 0.01 corresponds to 1 cM.\nBy representing alleles in a linear map, Sturtevant suggested that genes can range from being perfectly linked\n(recombination frequency = 0) to being perfectly unlinked (recombination frequency = 0.5) when genes are on different\nchromosomes or genes are separated very far apart on the same chromosome. Perfectly unlinked genes correspond to the\nfrequencies predicted by Mendel to assort independently in a dihybrid cross. A recombination frequency of 0.5 indicates\nthat 50 percent of offspring are recombinants and the other 50 percent are parental types. That is, every type of allele\ncombination is represented with equal frequency. This representation allowed Sturtevant to additively calculate distances\nbetween several genes on the same chromosome. However, as the genetic distances approached 0.50, his predictions became\nless accurate because it was not clear whether the genes were very far apart on the same chromosome or on different\nchromosomes.\nIn 1931, Barbara McClintock and Harriet Creighton demonstrated the crossover of homologous chromosomes in corn\nplants. Weeks later, homologous recombination in Drosophila was demonstrated microscopically by Curt Stern. Stern\nChapter 13 | Modern Understandings of Inheritance\n523\nobserved several X-linked phenotypes that were associated with a structurally unusual and dissimilar X chromosome pair\nin which one X was missing a small terminal segment, and the other X was fused to a piece of the Y chromosome. By\ncrossing flies, observing their offspring, and then visualizing the offspring\u2019s chromosomes, Stern demonstrated that every\ntime the offspring allele combination deviated from either of the parental combinations, there was a corresponding exchange\nof an X chromosome segment. Using mutant flies with structurally distinct X chromosomes was the key to observing the\nproducts of recombination because DNA sequencing and other molecular tools were not yet available. It is now known that\nhomologous chromosomes regularly exchange segments in meiosis by reciprocally breaking and rejoining their DNA at\nprecise locations.\nReview\nSturtevant\u2019s\nprocess\nto\ncreate\na\ngenetic\nmap\non\nthe\nbasis\nof\nrecombination\nfrequencies\nhere\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/gene_crossover) .\nGenetic diversity is the total number of genetic characteristics in a species.

Had he investigated both linked\nand unlinked genes, it would have been much more difficult for him to create a unified model of his data on the basis\nof probabilistic calculations. Researchers who have since mapped the seven traits investigated by Mendel onto the seven\nchromosomes of the pea plant genome have confirmed that all of the genes he examined are either on separate chromosomes\nor are sufficiently far apart as to be statistically unlinked. Some have suggested that Mendel was enormously lucky to select\nonly unlinked genes, whereas others question whether Mendel discarded any data suggesting linkage. In any case, Mendel\nconsistently observed independent assortment because he examined genes that were effectively unlinked.\n13.2 | Chromosomal Basis of Inherited Disorders\nIn this section, you will explore the following question:\n\u2022\nWhat are the genetic consequences that result from nondisjunction and errors in chromosome structure through\ninversions and translocations?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe number, size, shape, and banding patterns of chromosomes make them easily identifiable in a karyogram and allows for\nthe assessment of many chromosomal abnormalities.

        "summary": "The Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance, proposed by Sutton and Boveri in the early 1900s, identified chromosomes as the carriers of genes and explained Mendelian inheritance through their behavior during meiosis and fertilization. This theory was supported by observations of chromosome movement, gamete formation, and the equal genetic contribution from both parents, but direct evidence came later through Thomas Hunt Morgan\u2019s work with fruit flies, which revealed that linked genes on the same chromosome could violate Mendel\u2019s principles of independent assortment. Frans Janssen\u2019s discovery of chiasmata led to the understanding that homologous chromosomes exchange segments in a process called crossing over, producing recombinant offspring. Alfred Sturtevant used recombination frequencies from Morgan\u2019s lab to create the first chromosome map, measuring distances in centimorgans, and showing that genes farther apart are more likely to undergo recombination. Later, McClintock, Creighton, and Stern provided visual proof of crossing over, confirming its role in generating genetic diversity, while historical analysis of Mendel\u2019s traits revealed that he had studied only genes that were effectively unlinked."

Had he investigated both linked\nand unlinked genes, it would have been much more difficult for him to create a unified model of his data on the basis\nof probabilistic calculations. Researchers who have since mapped the seven traits investigated by Mendel onto the seven\nchromosomes of the pea plant genome have confirmed that all of the genes he examined are either on separate chromosomes\nor are sufficiently far apart as to be statistically unlinked. Some have suggested that Mendel was enormously lucky to select\nonly unlinked genes, whereas others question whether Mendel discarded any data suggesting linkage. In any case, Mendel\nconsistently observed independent assortment because he examined genes that were effectively unlinked.\n13.2 | Chromosomal Basis of Inherited Disorders\nIn this section, you will explore the following question:\n\u2022\nWhat are the genetic consequences that result from nondisjunction and errors in chromosome structure through\ninversions and translocations?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe number, size, shape, and banding patterns of chromosomes make them easily identifiable in a karyogram and allows for\nthe assessment of many chromosomal abnormalities.

One example is the failure of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids\nto separate properly during meiosis I or meiosis II (a phenomenon referred to as nondisjunction). This results in gametes\nwith too many or too few chromosomes. Disorders in chromosome number (aneuploidy) are typically lethal to the embryo,\nalthough a few trisomic genotypes are viable (e.g., Down syndrome). Because of X inactivation, aberrations in sex\nchromosomes typically have milder phenotypic effects (e.g., Turner syndrome) than aneuploidy. Sometimes segments of\nchromosome are duplicated, deleted, or rearranged by inversion or translocation. These aberrations can result in problematic\nphenotypic effects. Diagnostic testing can detect many of these chromosomal disorders in individuals well before birth,\nresulting in medical, ethical, and civic issues, such as the right to privacy.\nA condition in which an organism has more than the normal number of chromosome sets (two for diploid species) is called\npolyploidy. Polyploidy resulting in odd numbers of chromosomes is rare because it results in sterile organisms. One set\nof chromosomes has no pair so meiosis cannot proceed normally. In contrast, polyploidy resulting in even chromosome\nnumbers is very common in the plant kingdom. Polyploid plants tend to be larger and more robust than individuals with the\nnormal number of chromosomes.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework.

Chromosome disorders can be divided\ninto two categories: abnormalities in chromosome number and chromosomal structural rearrangements. Because even small\nsegments of chromosomes can span many genes, chromosomal disorders are characteristically dramatic and often fatal.\nIdentification of Chromosomes\nThe isolation and microscopic observation of chromosomes forms the basis of cytogenetics and is the primary method\nby which clinicians detect chromosomal abnormalities in humans. A karyotype is the number and appearance of\nchromosomes, and includes their length, banding pattern, and centromere position. To obtain a view of an individual\u2019s\nkaryotype, cytologists photograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into a chart, or karyogram,\nalso known as an ideogram (Figure 13.5).\nFigure 13.5 This karyotype is of a female human. Notice that homologous chromosomes are the same size, and have\nthe same centromere positions and banding patterns. A human male would have an XY chromosome pair instead of\nthe XX pair shown. (credit: Andreas Blozer et al)\nIn a given species, chromosomes can be identified by their number, size, centromere position, and banding pattern. In a\nhuman karyotype, autosomes or \u201cbody chromosomes\u201d (all of the non\u2013sex chromosomes) are generally organized in order\nof size from largest (chromosome 1) to smallest (chromosome 22). (The X and Y chromosomes, the 23rd pair, are not\nautosomes.) However, chromosome 21 is actually shorter than chromosome 22. This was discovered after the naming of\nDown syndrome as trisomy 21, reflecting how this disease results from possessing one extra chromosome 21 (three total).\nNot wanting to change the name of this disease, scientists retained the original numbering system. The chromosome \u201carms\u201d\nprojecting from either end of the centromere may be designated as short or long, depending on their relative lengths. The\nshort arm is abbreviated p (for \u201cpetite\u201d), whereas the long arm is abbreviated q (because it follows \u201cp\u201d alphabetically). Each\narm is further subdivided and denoted by a number. For example, locus 3 on the short arm of chromosome 21 is denoted\n21p3. Using this naming system, locations on chromosomes can be described consistently in the scientific literature.\n526\nChapter 13 | Modern Understandings of Inheritance\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nGeneticists Use Karyograms to Identify Chromosomal Aberrations\nAlthough Mendel is referred to as the \u201cfather of modern genetics,\u201d he performed his experiments with\nnone of the tools that the geneticists of today routinely employ. One such powerful cytological technique\nis karyotyping, a method in which traits characterized by chromosomal abnormalities can be identified\nfrom a single cell. To observe an individual\u2019s karyotype, a person\u2019s cells (like white blood cells) are first\ncollected from a blood sample or other tissue. In the laboratory, the isolated cells are stimulated to begin\nactively dividing. A chemical called colchicine is then applied to cells to arrest condensed chromosomes\nin metaphase. Cells are then made to swell using a hypotonic solution so the chromosomes spread apart.\nFinally, the sample is preserved in a fixative and applied to a slide.\nThe geneticist then stains chromosomes with one of several dyes to better visualize the distinct and\nreproducible banding patterns of each chromosome pair. Following staining, the chromosomes are viewed\nusing bright-field microscopy. A common stain choice is the Giemsa stain. Giemsa staining results in\napproximately 400\u2013800 bands (of tightly coiled DNA and condensed proteins) arranged along all of the 23\nchromosome pairs; an experienced geneticist can identify each band. In addition to the banding patterns,\nchromosomes are further identified on the basis of size and centromere location. To obtain the classic\ndepiction of the karyotype in which homologous pairs of chromosomes are aligned in numerical order\nfrom longest to shortest, the geneticist obtains a digital image, identifies each chromosome, and manually\narranges the chromosomes into this pattern (Figure 13.5).\nAt its most basic, the karyogram may reveal genetic abnormalities in which an individual has too many or\ntoo few chromosomes per cell. Examples of this are Down Syndrome, which is identified by a third copy of\nchromosome 21, and Turner Syndrome, which is characterized by the presence of only one X chromosome\nin women instead of the normal two. Geneticists can also identify large deletions or insertions of DNA.\nFor instance, Jacobsen Syndrome\u2014which involves distinctive facial features as well as heart and bleeding\ndefects\u2014is identified by a deletion on chromosome 11. Finally, the karyotype can pinpoint translocations,\nwhich occur when a segment of genetic material breaks from one chromosome and reattaches to another\nchromosome or to a different part of the same chromosome.\nDuring Mendel\u2019s lifetime, inheritance was an abstract concept that could only be inferred by performing\ncrosses and observing the traits expressed by offspring. By observing a karyogram, today\u2019s geneticists can\nactually visualize the chromosomal composition of an individual to confirm or predict genetic abnormalities\nin offspring, even before birth.\nDisorders in Chromosome Number\nOf all of the chromosomal disorders, abnormalities in chromosome number are the most obviously identifiable from a\nkaryogram. Disorders of chromosome number include the duplication or loss of entire chromosomes, as well as changes in\nthe number of complete sets of chromosomes. They are caused by nondisjunction, which occurs when pairs of homologous\nchromosomes or sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis. Misaligned or incomplete synapsis, or a dysfunction of\nthe spindle apparatus that facilitates chromosome migration, can cause nondisjunction. The risk of nondisjunction occurring\nincreases with the age of the parents.\nNondisjunction can occur during either meiosis I or II, with differing results (Figure 13.6). If homologous chromosomes\nfail to separate during meiosis I, the result is two gametes that lack that particular chromosome and two gametes with two\ncopies of the chromosome. If sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis II, the result is one gamete that lacks that\nchromosome, two normal gametes with one copy of the chromosome, and one gamete with two copies of the chromosome.\nChapter 13 | Modern Understandings of Inheritance\n527\nFigure 13.6 Nondisjunction occurs when homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids fail to separate during\nmeiosis, resulting in an abnormal chromosome number. Nondisjunction may occur during meiosis I or meiosis II.\nWhich of the following statements about nondisjunction is true?\na.\nNondisjunction only results in gametes with n+1 or n-1 chromosomes.\nb.\nNondisjunction occurring during meiosis II results in 50% normal gametes.\nc.\nNondisjunction during meiosis I results in 50% normal gametes.\nd.\nNondisjunction always results in four different kinds of gametes.\nAneuploidy\nAn individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their species is called euploid; in humans, euploidy\ncorresponds to 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. An individual with an error in chromosome number\nis described as aneuploid, a term that includes monosomy (loss of one chromosome) or trisomy (gain of an extraneous\nchromosome). Monosomic human zygotes missing any one copy of an autosome invariably fail to develop to birth because\nthey lack essential genes. This underscores the importance of \u201cgene dosage\u201d in humans. Most autosomal trisomies also fail\nto develop to birth; however, duplications of some of the smaller chromosomes (13, 15, 18, 21, or 22) can result in offspring\nthat survive for several weeks to many years. Trisomic individuals suffer from a different type of genetic imbalance: an\nexcess in gene dose. Individuals with an extra chromosome may synthesize an abundance of the gene products encoded\nby that chromosome. This extra dose (150 percent) of specific genes can lead to a number of functional challenges and\noften precludes development. The most common trisomy among viable births is that of chromosome 21, which corresponds\nto Down Syndrome. Individuals with this inherited disorder are characterized by short stature and stunted digits, facial\ndistinctions that include a broad skull and large tongue, and significant developmental delays. The incidence of Down\nsyndrome is correlated with maternal age; older women are more likely to become pregnant with fetuses carrying the\ntrisomy 21 genotype (Figure 13.7).\n528\nChapter 13 | Modern Understandings of Inheritance\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 13.7 The incidence of having a fetus with trisomy 21 increases dramatically with maternal age.\nVisualize\nthe\naddition\nof\na\nchromosome\nthat\nleads\nto\nDown\nsyndrome\nin\nthis\nvideo\nsimulation\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/down_syndrome) .\nWith increasing age, women are at increased risk of having a baby with a chromosomal abnormality such as Down\nsyndrome. Why is age a risk factor?\na.\nCells are more likely to make mistakes as we age due to an increase in the nondisjunction of cells during cell\ndivision, which is the reason for the occurrence of Down syndrome.\nb.\nThe chance of this disorder increases with age due to increased mistakes in the mitotic cells with age.\nc.\nThere are increased risks of translocation mutations with age, even though other mutation rates are constant,\nand this increases the risk.\nd.\nThe risk of having a child with Down syndrome is associated primarily with lifestyle factors that change\nwith age.\nPolyploidy\nAn individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets (two for diploid species) is called polyploid. For\ninstance, fertilization of an abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid zygote. Polyploid\nanimals are extremely rare, with only a few examples among the flatworms, crustaceans, amphibians, fish, and lizards.\nPolyploid animals are sterile because meiosis cannot proceed normally and instead produces mostly aneuploid daughter\ncells that cannot yield viable zygotes. Rarely, polyploid animals can reproduce asexually by haplodiploidy, in which an\nunfertilized egg divides mitotically to produce offspring. In contrast, polyploidy is very common in the plant kingdom, and\npolyploid plants tend to be larger and more robust than euploids of their species (Figure 13.8).\nChapter 13 | Modern Understandings of Inheritance\n529\nFigure 13.8 As with many polyploid plants, this triploid orange daylily (Hemerocallis fulva) is particularly large and\nrobust, and grows flowers with triple the number of petals of its diploid counterparts. (credit: Steve Karg)\nSex Chromosome Nondisjunction in Humans\nHumans display dramatic deleterious effects with autosomal trisomies and monosomies. Therefore, it may seem\ncounterintuitive that human females and males can function normally, despite carrying different numbers of the X\nchromosome. Rather than a gain or loss of autosomes, variations in the number of sex chromosomes are associated with\nrelatively mild effects. In part, this occurs because of a molecular process called X inactivation. Early in development,\nwhen female mammalian embryos consist of just a few thousand cells (relative to trillions in the newborn), one X\nchromosome in each cell inactivates by tightly condensing into a quiescent (dormant) structure called a Barr body. The\nchance that an X chromosome (maternally or paternally derived) is inactivated in each cell is random, but once the\ninactivation occurs, all cells derived from that one will have the same inactive X chromosome or Barr body. By this\nprocess, females compensate for their double genetic dose of X chromosome. In so-called \u201ctortoiseshell\u201d cats, embryonic X\ninactivation is observed as color variegation (Figure 13.9). Females that are heterozygous for an X-linked coat color gene\nwill express one of two different coat colors over different regions of their body, corresponding to whichever X chromosome\nis inactivated in the embryonic cell progenitor of that region.\nFigure 13.9 In cats, the gene for coat color is located on the X chromosome. In the embryonic development of female\ncats, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated in each cell, resulting in a tortoiseshell pattern if the cat\nhas two different alleles for coat color. Male cats, having only one X chromosome, never exhibit a tortoiseshell coat\ncolor. (credit: Michael Bodega)\nAn individual carrying an abnormal number of X chromosomes will inactivate all but one X chromosome in each of her\ncells. However, even inactivated X chromosomes continue to express a few genes, and X chromosomes must reactivate\nfor the proper maturation of female ovaries. As a result, X-chromosomal abnormalities are typically associated with mild\nmental and physical defects, as well as sterility. If the X chromosome is absent altogether, the individual will not develop in\n530\nChapter 13 | Modern Understandings of Inheritance\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nutero.\nSeveral errors in sex chromosome number have been characterized. Individuals with three X chromosomes, called triplo-\nX, are phenotypically female but express developmental delays and reduced fertility. The XXY genotype, corresponding\nto one type of Klinefelter syndrome, corresponds to phenotypically male individuals with small testes, enlarged breasts,\nand reduced body hair. More complex types of Klinefelter syndrome exist in which the individual has as many as five X\nchromosomes. In all types, every X chromosome except one undergoes inactivation to compensate for the excess genetic\ndosage. This can be seen as several Barr bodies in each cell nucleus. Turner syndrome, characterized as an X0 genotype\n(i.e., only a single sex chromosome), corresponds to a phenotypically female individual with short stature, webbed skin in\nthe neck region, hearing and cardiac impairments, and sterility.\nDuplications and Deletions\nIn addition to the loss or gain of an entire chromosome, a chromosomal segment may be duplicated or lost. Duplications\nand deletions often produce offspring that survive but exhibit physical and mental abnormalities. Duplicated chromosomal\nsegments may fuse to existing chromosomes or may be free in the nucleus. Cri-du-chat (from the French for \u201ccry of the cat\u201d)\nis a syndrome associated with nervous system abnormalities and identifiable physical features that result from a deletion of\nmost of 5p (the small arm of chromosome 5) (Figure 13.10). Infants with this genotype emit a characteristic high-pitched\ncry on which the disorder\u2019s name is based.\nFigure 13.10 This individual with cri-du-chat syndrome is shown at two, four, nine, and 12 years of age. (credit: Paola\nCerruti Mainardi)\nChromosomal Structural Rearrangements\nCytologists have characterized numerous structural rearrangements in chromosomes, but chromosome inversions and\ntranslocations are the most common. Both are identified during meiosis by the adaptive pairing of rearranged chromosomes\nwith their former homologs to maintain appropriate gene alignment. If the genes carried on two homologs are not oriented\ncorrectly, a recombination event could result in the loss of genes from one chromosome and the gain of genes on the other.\nThis would produce aneuploid gametes.\nChromosome Inversions\nA chromosome inversion is the detachment, 180\u00b0 rotation, and reinsertion of part of a chromosome. Inversions may occur\nChapter 13 | Modern Understandings of Inheritance\n531\nin nature as a result of mechanical shear, or from the action of transposable elements (special DNA sequences capable\nof facilitating the rearrangement of chromosome segments with the help of enzymes that cut and paste DNA sequences).\nUnless they disrupt a gene sequence, inversions only change the orientation of genes and are likely to have more mild\neffects than aneuploid errors. However, altered gene orientation can result in functional changes because regulators of gene\nexpression could be moved out of position with respect to their targets, causing aberrant levels of gene products.\nAn inversion can be pericentric and include the centromere, or paracentric and occur outside of the centromere (Figure\n13.11). A pericentric inversion that is asymmetric about the centromere can change the relative lengths of the chromosome\narms, making these inversions easily identifiable.\nFigure 13.11 Pericentric inversions include the centromere, and paracentric inversions do not. A pericentric inversion\ncan change the relative lengths of the chromosome arms; a paracentric inversion cannot.\nWhen one homologous chromosome undergoes an inversion but the other does not, the individual is described as an\ninversion heterozygote. To maintain point-for-point synapsis during meiosis, one homolog must form a loop, and the other\nhomolog must mold around it. Although this topology can ensure that the genes are correctly aligned, it also forces the\nhomologs to stretch and can be associated with regions of imprecise synapsis (Figure 13.12).\nFigure 13.12 When one chromosome undergoes an inversion but the other does not, one chromosome must form an\ninverted loop to retain point-for-point interaction during synapsis. This inversion pairing is essential to maintaining gene\nalignment during meiosis and to allow for recombination.\n532\nChapter 13 | Modern Understandings of Inheritance\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nThe Chromosome 18 Inversion\nNot all structural rearrangements of chromosomes produce nonviable, impaired, or infertile individuals. In\nrare instances, such a change can result in the evolution of a new species. In fact, a pericentric inversion in\nchromosome 18 appears to have contributed to the evolution of humans. This inversion is not present in our\nclosest genetic relatives, the chimpanzees. Humans and chimpanzees differ cytogenetically by pericentric\ninversions on several chromosomes and by the fusion of two separate chromosomes in chimpanzees that\ncorrespond to chromosome two in humans.\nThe pericentric chromosome 18 inversion is believed to have occurred in early humans following their\ndivergence from a common ancestor with chimpanzees approximately five million years ago. Researchers\ncharacterizing this inversion have suggested that approximately 19,000 nucleotide bases were duplicated\non 18p, and the duplicated region inverted and reinserted on chromosome 18 of an ancestral human.\nA comparison of human and chimpanzee genes in the region of this inversion indicates that two\ngenes\u2014ROCK1 and USP14\u2014that are adjacent on chimpanzee chromosome 17 (which corresponds to\nhuman chromosome 18) are more distantly positioned on human chromosome 18. This suggests that one\nof the inversion breakpoints occurred between these two genes. Interestingly, humans and chimpanzees\nexpress USP14 at distinct levels in specific cell types, including cortical cells and fibroblasts. Perhaps the\nchromosome 18 inversion in an ancestral human repositioned specific genes and reset their expression\nlevels in a useful way. Because both ROCK1 and USP14 encode cellular enzymes, a change in their\nexpression could alter cellular function. It is not known how this inversion contributed to hominid evolution,\nbut it appears to be a significant factor in the divergence of humans from other primates.\n[1]\nAccording to the passage, which of the following events are believed to have occurred after humans diverged from\ntheir common ancestor with chimpanzees?\na.\nParacentric inversions occurred at several chromosomes, including human chromosome 18.\nb.\nTwo separate chromosomes underwent a pericentric inversion, then fused to form chromosome 2 in humans.\nc.\n19, 000 nucleotide bases were duplicated, inverted, and reinserted at human chromosome 18.\nd.\nThe ROCK1 and USP14 genes were duplicated in early humans, which increased expression of these genes.\nTranslocations\nA translocation occurs when a segment of a chromosome dissociates and reattaches to a different, nonhomologous\nchromosome. Translocations can be benign or have devastating effects depending on how the positions of genes are altered\nwith respect to regulatory sequences. Reciprocal translocations result from the exchange of chromosome segments between\ntwo nonhomologous chromosomes such that there is no gain or loss of genetic information (Figure 13.13).\n1.\nViolaine Goidts et al., \u201cSegmental duplication associated with the human-specific inversion of chromosome 18: a further example of the impact of segmental\nduplications on karyotype and genome evolution in primates,\u201d Human Genetics. 115 (2004):116-122\nChapter 13 | Modern Understandings of Inheritance\n533\nFigure 13.13 A reciprocal translocation occurs when a segment of DNA is transferred from one chromosome to\nanother, nonhomologous chromosome.

        "summary": "The chromosomal basis of inherited disorders involves abnormalities in chromosome number or structure that arise from errors during meiosis, such as nondisjunction, which can cause aneuploidy (e.g., trisomy 21/Down syndrome or monosomy in Turner syndrome) and polyploidy. These errors can be detected through karyotyping, which visually reveals changes like extra or missing chromosomes, large deletions, duplications, inversions, or translocations. While autosomal aneuploidies are often severe or lethal, sex chromosome abnormalities tend to have milder effects due to X inactivation. Structural alterations, including deletions (e.g., cri-du-chat syndrome), duplications, inversions, and translocations, can lead to significant physical and cognitive abnormalities by disrupting gene dosage or regulation. Inversions can be pericentric or paracentric, and translocations may be reciprocal without loss of genetic material, though both can impact fertility and viability. Some changes, like the human chromosome 18 inversion, may even have played roles in evolutionary divergence."

Between 2000 and 2015, evidence from\nDNA was used to exonerate over 250 innocent people. Twenty of those people were on death row after being convicted\nof a murder they didn\u2019t commit. To learn more about the intense scientific and legal processes used to exonerate those\nwrongfully convicted, go to The Innocence Project website here (http://www.openstaxcollege.org/l/32innocence) .\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\n543\n14.1 | Historical Basis of Modern Understanding\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat is transformation of DNA? How do Griffith\u2019s experiments in 1928 relate to our modern understanding of\nDNA and how it works?\n\u2022\nWhat are key historic experiments that helped identify DNA as the genetic material?\n\u2022\nWhat are Chargaff\u2019s rules of nitrogenous base pairing?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nToday the three letters \u201cDNA\u201d have become synonymous with crime solving, paternity testing, human identification, and\ngenetic testing. All of these procedures are possible because of the discovery, in the middle of the twentieth century, that\nDNA is the genetic material. The results of several classic experiments set the stage for an explosion of our knowledge about\nDNA and how it stores and transmits genetic information. DNA was first isolated from white blood cells by Miescher in\nthe 1860s. Over fifty years later, Griffith\u2019s work transforming strains of the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae provided\nthe first clue that DNA and not protein (as others argued) is the universal molecule of heredity. Griffith\u2019s conclusions were\nlater supported by Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty.\nSubsequent experiments by Hershey and Chase using the bacteriophage T2 proved decisively that DNA is the genetic\nmaterial. Shortly thereafter, Chargaff determined the ratios of adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine in DNA, suggesting\npaired relationships (A = T and C = G). He also found that the percentages of A, T, C, and G are different for different\nspecies. All of these historically important experiments shaped our current understanding of DNA.\nThe content presented in this section supports the learning objectives outlined in Big Ideas 3 and 4 of the AP\u00ae Biology\nCurriculum Framework. The AP\u00ae learning objectives merge essential knowledge content with one or more of the seven\nscience practices.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 3.2][APLO 3.28][APLO 1.11][APLO 1.16][APLO 3.1][APLO 4.1]\nModern understandings of DNA have evolved from the discovery of nucleic acid to the development of the double-helix\nmodel. In the 1860s, Friedrich Miescher (Figure 14.2), a physician by profession, was the first person to isolate phosphate-\nrich chemicals from white blood cells or leukocytes. He named these chemicals (which would eventually be known as RNA\nand DNA) nuclein because they were isolated from the nuclei of the cells.\nFigure 14.2 Friedrich Miescher (1844\u20131895) discovered nucleic acids.\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\n545\nTo see Miescher conduct an experiment step-by-step, click through this review (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/\nmiescher_levene) of how he discovered the key role of DNA and proteins in the nucleus.\nWhy were Phoebus Levene\u2019s discoveries important to our current understanding of DNA?\na.\nPhoebus Levene believed that the four nucleotides in DNA are not linked or repeated in the same pattern and\nthat they are held together by phosphodiester bonds.\nb.\nHe discovered that the nucleotides were held together by phosphodiester bonds, in which two phosphate\ngroups bind two sugars together. This discovery led to our current understanding of DNA.\nc.\nHe believed that proteins were less likely the vehicles for hereditary information. Later he discovered the\nfour nucleotides in DNA which were linked together and repeated in a wide variety of different ways.\nd.\nHe believed inaccurately that the four nucleotides in DNA repeated over in the same pattern. Also, he\ndiscovered that the nucleotides were held together by phosphodiester bonds in which the phosphate group\nbinds two sugars together.\nA half century later, British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith was perhaps the first person to show that hereditary information\ncould be transferred from one cell to another \u201chorizontally,\u201d rather than by descent. In 1928, he reported the first\ndemonstration of bacterial transformation, a process in which external DNA is taken up by a cell, thereby changing\nmorphology and physiology. He was working with Streptococcus pneumoniae, the bacterium that causes pneumonia.\nGriffith worked with two strains, rough (R) and smooth (S). The R strain is non-pathogenic (does not cause disease) and\nis called rough because its outer surface is a cell wall and lacks a capsule; as a result, the cell surface appears uneven\nunder the microscope. The S strain is pathogenic (disease-causing) and has a capsule outside its cell wall. As a result, it\nhas a smooth appearance under the microscope. Griffith injected the live R strain into mice and they survived. In another\nexperiment, when he injected mice with the heat-killed S strain, they also survived. In a third set of experiments, a mixture\nof live R strain and heat-killed S strain were injected into mice, and\u2014to his surprise\u2014the mice died. Upon isolating the live\nbacteria from the dead mouse, only the S strain of bacteria was recovered. When this isolated S strain was injected into fresh\nmice, the mice died. Griffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain into the live R strain and\ntransformed it into the pathogenic S strain, and he called this the transforming principle (Figure 14.3). These experiments\nare now famously known as Griffith's transformation experiments.\n546\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 14.3 Two strains of S. pneumoniae were used in Griffith\u2019s transformation experiments. The R strain is non-\npathogenic. The S strain is pathogenic and causes death. When Griffith injected a mouse with the heat-killed S strain\nand a live R strain, the mouse died. The S strain was recovered from the dead mouse. Thus, Griffith concluded that\nsomething had passed from the heat-killed S strain to the R strain, transforming the R strain into S strain in the process.\n(credit \"living mouse\": modification of work by NIH; credit \"dead mouse\": modification of work by Sarah Marriage)\nScientists Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty (1944) were interested in exploring this transforming\nprinciple further. They isolated the S strain from the dead mice and isolated the proteins and nucleic acids, namely RNA and\nDNA, as these were possible candidates for the molecule of heredity. They conducted a systematic elimination study. They\nused enzymes that specifically degraded each component and then used each mixture separately to transform the R strain.\nThey found that when DNA was degraded, the resulting mixture was no longer able to transform the bacteria, whereas all\nof the other combinations were able to transform the bacteria. This led them to conclude that DNA was the transforming\nprinciple.\nForensic Scientists and DNA Analysis\nDNA evidence was used for the first time to solve an immigration case. The story started with a teenage boy\nreturning to London from Ghana to be with his mother. Immigration authorities at the airport were suspicious\nof him, thinking that he was traveling on a forged passport. After much persuasion, he was allowed to\ngo live with his mother, but the immigration authorities did not drop the case against him. All types of\nevidence, including photographs, were provided to the authorities, but deportation proceedings were started\nnevertheless. Around the same time, Dr. Alec Jeffreys of Leicester University in the United Kingdom had\ninvented a technique known as DNA fingerprinting. The immigration authorities approached Dr. Jeffreys\nfor help. He took DNA samples from the mother and three of her children, plus an unrelated mother, and\ncompared the samples with the boy\u2019s DNA. Because the biological father was not in the picture, DNA from\nthe three children was compared with the boy\u2019s DNA. He found a match in the boy\u2019s DNA for both the mother\nand his three siblings. He concluded that the boy was indeed the mother\u2019s son.\nForensic scientists analyze many items, including documents, handwriting, firearms, and biological\nsamples. They analyze the DNA content of hair, semen, saliva, and blood, and compare it with a database\nof DNA profiles of known criminals. Analysis includes DNA isolation, sequencing, and sequence analysis;\nmost forensic DNA analysis involves polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of short tandem repeat\n(STR) loci and electrophoresis to determine the length of the PCR-amplified fragment. Only mitochondrial\nDNA is sequenced for forensics. Forensic scientists are expected to appear at court hearings to present\ntheir findings. They are usually employed in crime labs of city and state government agencies. Geneticists\nexperimenting with DNA techniques also work for scientific and research organizations, pharmaceutical\nindustries, and college and university labs. Students wishing to pursue a career as a forensic scientist\nshould have at least a bachelor's degree in chemistry, biology, or physics, and preferably some experience\nworking in a laboratory.\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\n547\nActivity DNA Necklace.\n1) Using a molecular modeling kit (or an online virtual kit such as jmol), create a model of each of the 4\nnucleotides in DNA, based on structural diagrams found in this chapter or elsewhere online.\n2) Identify where each nucleotide hydrogen-bonds with its complementary base. Add these bonds to secure\nthe two pairs of nucleotides together. How does the hydrogen bonding differ between the two pairs of\ncomplementary bases?\n3) Now look at a structural diagram of a complete DNA molecule. Based on the diagram, connect your two\npairs of nucleotides together along your DNA\u2019s sugar-phosphate backbone (depending on your model kit,\nyou may have to first disconnect the hydrogen bonds between the complementary bases). Which atoms\nand molecules did you have to remove and add to create the sugar-phosphate backbone?\nThink About It\nExplain why radioactive sulfur and phosphorus were used to label T2 bacteriophages in the Hershey-Chase\nexperiments. How did the results of these experiments contribute to the identification of DNA as the genetic material?\nExperiments conducted by Martha Chase and Alfred Hershey in 1952 provided confirmatory evidence that DNA was the\ngenetic material and not proteins. Chase and Hershey were studying a bacteriophage, which is a virus that infects bacteria.\nViruses typically have a simple structure: a protein coat, called the capsid, and a nucleic acid core that contains the genetic\nmaterial, either DNA or RNA. The bacteriophage infects the host bacterial cell by attaching to its surface, and then it\ninjects its nucleic acids inside the cell. The phage DNA makes multiple copies of itself using the host machinery, and\neventually the host cell bursts, releasing a large number of bacteriophages. Hershey and Chase labeled one batch of phage\nwith radioactive sulfur, 35S, to label the protein coat. Another batch of phage were labeled with radioactive phosphorus,\n32P. Because phosphorous is found in DNA, but not protein, the DNA and not the protein would be tagged with radioactive\nphosphorus.\nEach batch of phage was allowed to infect the cells separately. After infection, the phage bacterial suspension was put in a\nblender, which caused the phage coat to be detached from the host cell. The phage and bacterial suspension was spun down\nin a centrifuge. The heavier bacterial cells settled down and formed a pellet, whereas the lighter phage particles stayed in\nthe supernatant. In the tube that contained phage labeled with 35S, the supernatant contained the radioactively labeled phage,\nwhereas no radioactivity was detected in the pellet. In the tube that contained the phage labeled with 32P, the radioactivity\nwas detected in the pellet that contained the heavier bacterial cells, and no radioactivity was detected in the supernatant.\nHershey and Chase concluded that it was the phage DNA that was injected into the cell and carried information to produce\nmore phage particles, thus providing evidence that DNA was the genetic material and not proteins (Figure 14.4).\n548\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 14.4 In Hershey and Chase's experiments, bacteria were infected with phage radiolabeled with either 35S,\nwhich labels protein, or 32P, which labels DNA. Only 32P entered the bacterial cells, indicating that DNA is the genetic\nmaterial.\nAround this same time, Austrian biochemist Erwin Chargaff examined the content of DNA in different species and found\nthat the amounts of adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine were not found in equal quantities, and that it varied from\nspecies to species, but not between individuals of the same species. He found that the amount of adenine equals the amount\nof thymine, and the amount of cytosine equals the amount of guanine, or A = T and G = C. This is also known as Chargaff\u2019s\nrules.

Around the same time, Erwin Chargaff discovered that in DNA, adenine pairs with thymine and cytosine pairs with guanine (Chargaff\u2019s rules), and that base composition varies between species. Together, these findings laid the foundation for the later discovery of DNA\u2019s structure and its role in heredity."

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 3.3][APLO 3.5][APLO 3.13]\nThe building blocks of DNA are nucleotides. The important components of the nucleotide are a nitrogenous base,\ndeoxyribose (5-carbon sugar), and a phosphate group (Figure 14.5). The nucleotide is named depending on the nitrogenous\nbase. The nitrogenous base can be a purine such as adenine (A) and guanine (G), or a pyrimidine such as cytosine (C) and\nthymine (T).\n550\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 14.5 Each nucleotide is made up of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The sugar is\ndeoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA.\nThe nucleotides combine with each other by covalent bonds known as phosphodiester bonds or linkages. The purines have\na double ring structure with a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. Pyrimidines are smaller in size; they have\na single six-membered ring structure. The carbon atoms of the five-carbon sugar are numbered 1', 2', 3', 4', and 5' (1' is read\nas \u201cone prime\u201d). The phosphate residue is attached to the hydroxyl group of the 5' carbon of one sugar of one nucleotide\nand the hydroxyl group of the 3' carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide, thereby forming a 5'-3' phosphodiester bond.\nIn the 1950s, Francis Crick and James Watson worked together to determine the structure of DNA at the University of\nCambridge, England. Other scientists like Linus Pauling and Maurice Wilkins were also actively exploring this field.\nPauling had discovered the secondary structure of proteins using X-ray crystallography. In Wilkins\u2019 lab, researcher Rosalind\nFranklin was using X-ray diffraction methods to understand the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick were able to piece\ntogether the puzzle of the DNA molecule on the basis of Franklin's data because Crick had also studied X-ray diffraction\n(Figure 14.6). In 1962, James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine.\nUnfortunately, by then Franklin had died, and Nobel prizes are not awarded posthumously.\nFigure 14.6 The work of pioneering scientists (a) James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maclyn McCarty led to our present\nday understanding of DNA. Scientist Rosalind Franklin discovered (b) the X-ray diffraction pattern of DNA, which\nhelped to elucidate its double helix structure. (credit a: modification of work by Marjorie McCarty, Public Library of\nScience)\nWatson and Crick proposed that DNA is made up of two strands that are twisted around each other to form a right-handed\nhelix. Base pairing takes place between a purine and pyrimidine; namely, A pairs with T and G pairs with C. Adenine\nand thymine are complementary base pairs, and cytosine and guanine are also complementary base pairs. The base pairs\nare stabilized by hydrogen bonds; adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds and cytosine and guanine form three\nhydrogen bonds. The two strands are anti-parallel in nature; that is, the 3' end of one strand faces the 5' end of the other\nstrand. The sugar and phosphate of the nucleotides form the backbone of the structure, whereas the nitrogenous bases are\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\n551\nstacked inside. Each base pair is separated from the other base pair by a distance of 0.34 nm, and each turn of the helix\nmeasures 3.4 nm. Therefore, ten base pairs are present per turn of the helix. The diameter of the DNA double helix is 2\nnm, and it is uniform throughout. Only the pairing between a purine and pyrimidine can explain the uniform diameter. The\ntwisting of the two strands around each other results in the formation of uniformly spaced major and minor grooves (Figure\n14.7).\nFigure 14.7 DNA has (a) a double helix structure and (b) phosphodiester bonds. The (c) major and minor grooves\nare binding sites for DNA binding proteins during processes such as transcription (the copying of RNA from DNA) and\nreplication.\nActivity\nRead Watson and Crick\u2019s original Nature article, \u201cMolecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for\nDeoxyribose Nucleic Acid,\u201d How did Watson and Crick\u2019s model build on the findings of Rosalind Franklin?\nHow did their model of DNA build on the findings of Hershey and Chase, and others, showing that DNA can\nencode and pass information on to the next generation?\nThink About It\nWatson and Crick\u2019s work determined the structure of DNA.

Using\nradiolabeled nucleotides also compounded the problem through safety concerns. With currently available technology and\nautomated machines, the process is cheap, safer, and can be completed in a matter of hours. Fred Sanger developed the\nsequencing method used for the human genome sequencing project, which is widely used today (Figure 14.8).\nVisit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/DNA_sequencing) to watch a video explaining the DNA sequence reading\ntechnique that resulted from Sanger\u2019s work.\nDescribe one advantage and a possible limitation to Sanger\u2019s method.\na.\nSanger\u2019s method can be used to sequence more than one strand at a time which is less time consuming.\nChallenges of Sanger\u2019s method includes its decreased accuracy to sequence DNA strands.\nb.\nSanger\u2019s method is a reliable and accurate way of sequencing DNA strands. However, only one strand at a\ntime can be sequenced at a time. Also, it can look for one base only at a time which can be time consuming.\nc.\nSanger\u2019s method is highly inexpensive and less accurate. However, it is not readily adaptable to commercial\nkits.\nd.\nSanger\u2019s method is less time consuming and highly accurate. However, it is more expensive than other\nmethods available for sequencing.\nThe method is known as the dideoxy chain termination method. The sequencing method is based on the use of chain\nterminators, the dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs). The dideoxynucleotides, or ddNTPSs, differ from the deoxynucleotides by\nthe lack of a free 3' OH group on the five-carbon sugar. If a ddNTP is added to a growing a DNA strand, the chain\nis not extended any further because the free 3' OH group needed to add another nucleotide is not available. By using a\npredetermined ratio of deoxyribonucleotides to dideoxynucleotides, it is possible to generate DNA fragments of different\nsizes.\nFigure 14.8 In Frederick Sanger's dideoxy chain termination method, dye-labeled dideoxynucleotides are used to\ngenerate DNA fragments that terminate at different points. The DNA is separated by capillary electrophoresis on the\nbasis of size, and from the order of fragments formed, the DNA sequence can be read. The DNA sequence readout is\nshown on an electropherogram that is generated by a laser scanner.\nThe DNA sample to be sequenced is denatured or separated into two strands by heating it to high temperatures. The\nDNA is divided into four tubes in which a primer, DNA polymerase, and all four nucleotides (A, T, G, and C) are added.\nIn addition to each of the four tubes, limited quantities of one of the four dideoxynucleotides are added to each tube\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\n553\nrespectively. The tubes are labeled as A, T, G, and C according to the ddNTP added. For detection purposes, each of the four\ndideoxynucleotides carries a different fluorescent label. Chain elongation continues until a fluorescent dideoxy nucleotide\nis incorporated, after which no further elongation takes place. After the reaction is over, electrophoresis is performed. Even\na difference in length of a single base can be detected. The sequence is read from a laser scanner.

Usually the gel is made of a chemical\ncalled agarose. Agarose powder is added to a buffer and heated. After cooling, the gel solution is poured into a casting tray.\nOnce the gel has solidified, the DNA is loaded on the gel and electric current is applied. The DNA has a net negative charge\nand moves from the negative electrode toward the positive electrode. The electric current is applied for sufficient time to\nlet the DNA separate according to size; the smallest fragments will be farthest from the well (where the DNA was loaded),\nand the heavier molecular weight fragments will be closest to the well. Once the DNA is separated, the gel is stained with a\nDNA-specific dye for viewing it (Figure 14.9).\n554\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 14.9 DNA can be separated on the basis of size using gel electrophoresis.

Green et al.\nin 2010.\n[1] Neanderthals are the closest ancestors of present-day humans. They were known to have\nlived in Europe and Western Asia before they disappeared from fossil records approximately 30,000 years\nago. Green\u2019s team studied almost 40,000-year-old fossil remains that were selected from sites across\nthe world. Extremely sophisticated means of sample preparation and DNA sequencing were employed\nbecause of the fragile nature of the bones and heavy microbial contamination. In their study, the scientists\nwere able to sequence some four billion base pairs. The Neanderthal sequence was compared with that\nof present-day humans from across the world. After comparing the sequences, the researchers found\nthat the Neanderthal genome had 2 to 3 percent greater similarity to people living outside Africa than\nto people in Africa. While current theories have suggested that all present-day humans can be traced to\na small ancestral population in Africa, the data from the Neanderthal genome may contradict this view.\nGreen and his colleagues also discovered DNA segments among people in Europe and Asia that are\nmore similar to Neanderthal sequences than to other contemporary human sequences. Another interesting\nobservation was that Neanderthals are as closely related to people from Papua New Guinea as to those\nfrom China or France. This is surprising because Neanderthal fossil remains have been located only\nin Europe and West Asia. Most likely, genetic exchange took place between Neanderthals and modern\nhumans as modern humans emerged out of Africa, before the divergence of Europeans, East Asians, and\nPapua New Guineans.\nSeveral genes seem to have undergone changes from Neanderthals during the evolution of present-\nday humans. These genes are involved in cranial structure, metabolism, skin morphology, and cognitive\ndevelopment. One of the genes that is of particular interest is RUNX2, which is different in modern day\nhumans and Neanderthals. This gene is responsible for the prominent frontal bone, bell-shaped rib cage,\nand dental differences seen in Neanderthals. It is speculated that an evolutionary change in RUNX2 was\nimportant in the origin of modern-day humans, and this affected the cranium and the upper body.\nAccording to the passage, which statement best describes the relationship between humans and Neanderthals?\na.\nEarly humans emerged from Africa, then spread out to populate different parts of the globe. An isolated\npopulation of these early humans interbred with Neanderthals.\nb.\nEarly humans interbred with Neanderthals, emerged from Africa, then spread out to populate different parts\nof the globe.\nc.\nEarly humans emerged from Africa, interbred with Neanderthals, then spread out to populate different parts\nof the globe.\nd.\nEarly humans did not interbreed with Neanderthals, but we have many genetic similarities because we share\na common ancestor.\n1.\nRichard E.

This is supported by the research\nthat genetic variance in Africa was also found in the rest of the world.\nb.\nThe theory that humans descended from Africa was supported by the research that most of the human\ngenomes tested outside of Africa had close ties to the genomes of people in Africa but a genetic variance in\nAfrica was not found in the rest of the world.\nc.\nHumans have most likely descended from Africa.

Thus, human genomes tested\noutside of Africa had close ties to the genomes of people in Africa.\nDNA Packaging in Cells\nWhen comparing prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, prokaryotes are much simpler than eukaryotes in many of their\nfeatures (Figure 14.10). Most prokaryotes contain a single, circular chromosome that is found in an area of the cytoplasm\ncalled the nucleoid.\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\n557\nFigure 14.10 A eukaryote contains a well-defined nucleus, whereas in prokaryotes, the chromosome lies in the\ncytoplasm in an area called the nucleoid.\nIn eukaryotic cells, DNA and RNA synthesis occur in a separate compartment from protein synthesis. In prokaryotic\ncells, both processes occur together. What advantages might there be to separating the processes? What advantages\nmight there be to having them occur together?\na.\nCompartmentalization in eukaryotic cells enables the building of more complex proteins and RNA products.\nIn prokaryotes, the advantage is that RNA and protein synthesis occurs much more quickly because it occurs\nin a single compartment.\nb.\nCompartmentalization in prokaryotic cells enables the building of more complex proteins and RNA products.\nIn eukaryotes, the advantage is that RNA and protein synthesis occurs much more quickly because they occur\nin a single compartment.\nc.\nCompartmentalization in eukaryotic cells enables the building of simpler proteins and RNA products.

So how does this fit inside a small bacterial cell? The DNA is twisted by what is known\nas supercoiling. Supercoiling means that DNA is either under-wound (less than one turn of the helix per 10 base pairs) or\nover-wound (more than 1 turn per 10 base pairs) from its normal relaxed state. Some proteins are known to be involved in\nthe supercoiling; other proteins and enzymes such as DNA gyrase help in maintaining the supercoiled structure.\nEukaryotes, whose chromosomes each consist of a linear DNA molecule, employ a different type of packing strategy to fit\ntheir DNA inside the nucleus (Figure 14.11). At the most basic level, DNA is wrapped around proteins known as histones\nto form structures called nucleosomes. The histones are evolutionarily conserved proteins that are rich in basic amino acids\nand form an octamer. The DNA (which is negatively charged because of the phosphate groups) is wrapped tightly around\nthe histone core. This nucleosome is linked to the next one with the help of a linker DNA. This is also known as the \u201cbeads\non a string\u201d structure. This is further compacted into a 30 nm fiber, which is the diameter of the structure. At the metaphase\nstage, the chromosomes are at their most compact, are approximately 700 nm in width, and are found in association with\nscaffold proteins.\nIn interphase, eukaryotic chromosomes have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining. The tightly packaged\nregion is known as heterochromatin, and the less dense region is known as euchromatin. Heterochromatin usually contains\ngenes that are not expressed, and is found in the regions of the centromere and telomeres. The euchromatin usually contains\ngenes that are transcribed, with DNA packaged around nucleosomes but not further compacted.\n558\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 14.11 These figures illustrate the compaction of the eukaryotic chromosome.\n14.3 | Basics of DNA Replication\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow does the structure of DNA provide for the process of replication?\n\u2022\nHow did the Meselson and Stahl experiments support the semi-conservative nature of replication?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe Watson and Crick model suggested a way in which DNA could be replicated during cell division.

        "summary": "The structure of DNA, elucidated by Watson and Crick in 1953 with critical contributions from Rosalind Franklin\u2019s X-ray crystallography data, consists of two complementary, anti-parallel strands forming a right-handed double helix. DNA is a polymer of nucleotides\u2014each composed of a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base (purine A or G, pyrimidine C or T)\u2014linked by phosphodiester bonds, with base pairing occurring between A\u2013T (two hydrogen bonds) and G\u2013C (three hydrogen bonds), creating a uniform 2 nm diameter helix with major and minor grooves. DNA sequencing, once slow and costly, was revolutionized by Fred Sanger\u2019s dideoxy chain termination method, which uses fluorescently labeled chain-terminating nucleotides to generate variable-length DNA fragments that are separated by capillary electrophoresis and read by laser scanners. This technology, now automated and rapid, underpins genomic research such as the sequencing of the Neanderthal genome, which revealed interbreeding between Neanderthals and non-African modern humans and identified genetic differences influencing traits like cranial structure. DNA packaging differs between organisms: prokaryotes typically have a single circular chromosome in the nucleoid, compacted by supercoiling, while eukaryotic DNA is wrapped around histone proteins into nucleosomes, further condensed into higher-order structures, with tightly packed heterochromatin often transcriptionally inactive and more loosely packed euchromatin typically containing active genes."

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 2.34][APLO 3.3][APLO 4.1]\nThe elucidation of the structure of the double helix provided a hint as to how DNA divides and makes copies of itself. This\nmodel suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template\nfrom which the new complementary strand is copied. What was not clear was how the replication took place. There were\nthree models suggested (Figure 14.12): conservative, semi-conservative, and dispersive.\nFigure 14.12 The three suggested models of DNA replication. Grey indicates the original DNA strands, and blue\nindicates newly synthesized DNA.\nIn conservative replication, the parental DNA remains together, and the newly formed daughter strands are together. The\nsemi-conservative method suggests that each of the two parental DNA strands act as a template for new DNA to be\nsynthesized; after replication, each double-stranded DNA includes one parental or \u201cold\u201d strand and one \u201cnew\u201d strand. In\nthe dispersive model, both copies of DNA have double-stranded segments of parental DNA and newly synthesized DNA\ninterspersed.\nMeselson and Stahl were interested in understanding how DNA replicates. They grew E. coli for several generations in a\nmedium containing a \u201cheavy\u201d isotope of nitrogen (15N) that gets incorporated into nitrogenous bases, and eventually into\nthe DNA (Figure 14.13).\n560\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 14.13 Meselson and Stahl experimented with E. coli grown first in heavy nitrogen (15N) then in 14N. DNA grown\nin 15N (red band) is heavier than DNA grown in 14N (orange band), and sediments to a lower level in cesium chloride\nsolution in an ultracentrifuge. When DNA grown in 15N is switched to media containing 14N, after one round of cell\ndivision the DNA sediments halfway between the 15N and 14N levels, indicating that it now contains fifty percent 14N. In\nsubsequent cell divisions, an increasing amount of DNA contains 14N only. This data supports the semi-conservative\nreplication model. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nThe E. coli culture was then shifted into medium containing 14N and allowed to grow for one generation. The cells were\nharvested and the DNA was isolated. The DNA was centrifuged at high speeds in an ultracentrifuge. Some cells were\nallowed to grow for one more life cycle in 14N and spun again. During the density gradient centrifugation, the DNA is\nloaded into a gradient (typically a salt such as cesium chloride or sucrose) and spun at high speeds of 50,000 to 60,000\nrpm. Under these circumstances, the DNA will form a band according to its density in the gradient. DNA grown in 15N will\nband at a higher density position than that grown in 14N. Meselson and Stahl noted that after one generation of growth in\n14N after they had been shifted from 15N, the single band observed was intermediate in position in between DNA of cells\ngrown exclusively in 15N and 14N. This suggested either a semi-conservative or dispersive mode of replication. The DNA\nharvested from cells grown for two generations in 14N formed two bands: one DNA band was at the intermediate position\nbetween 15N and 14N, and the other corresponded to the band of 14N DNA. These results could only be explained if DNA\nreplicates in a semi-conservative manner. Therefore, the other two modes were ruled out.\nDuring DNA replication, each of the two strands that make up the double helix serves as a template from which new strands\nare copied. The new strand will be complementary to the parental or \u201cold\u201d strand. When two daughter DNA copies are\nformed, they have the same sequence and are divided equally into the two daughter cells.\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\n561\nClick through this tutorial (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/DNA_replicatio2) on DNA replication.\nOne theory of aging is that the body\u2019s ability to fix mistakes in its DNA decreases as we age.

This mechanism is described as semi-conservative because each resulting DNA molecule contains one original (parental) strand and one newly synthesized strand. Alternative models once proposed included conservative replication, where parental strands remain together, and dispersive replication, where new DNA segments are interspersed with old. The Meselson and Stahl experiments, using nitrogen isotope labeling in E. coli and density gradient centrifugation, provided strong evidence for the semi-conservative model: after one generation in lighter nitrogen, DNA bands appeared at intermediate density, and after two generations, distinct intermediate and light bands emerged. These results ruled out conservative and dispersive replication, confirming that each DNA strand acts as a template to produce identical daughter molecules that are equally distributed to daughter cells."

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 4.3][APLO 1.18][APLO 1.21]\nDNA replication has been extremely well studied in prokaryotes primarily because of the small size of the genome and the\nmutants that are available. E. coli has 4.6 million base pairs in a single circular chromosome and all of it gets replicated in\napproximately 42 minutes, starting from a single origin of replication and proceeding around the circle in both directions.\nThis means that approximately 1000 nucleotides are added per second. The process is quite rapid and occurs without many\nmistakes.\nDNA replication employs a large number of proteins and enzymes, each of which plays a critical role during the process.\nOne of the key players is the enzyme DNA polymerase, also known as DNA pol, which adds nucleotides one by one to the\ngrowing DNA chain that are complementary to the template strand. The addition of nucleotides requires energy; this energy\nis obtained from the nucleotides that have three phosphates attached to them, similar to ATP which has three phosphate\ngroups attached. When the bond between the phosphates is broken, the energy released is used to form the phosphodiester\nbond between the incoming nucleotide and the growing chain. In prokaryotes, three main types of polymerases are known:\nDNA pol I, DNA pol II, and DNA pol III. It is now known that DNA pol III is the enzyme required for DNA synthesis;\nDNA pol I and DNA pol II are primarily required for repair.\nHow does the replication machinery know where to begin? It turns out that there are specific nucleotide sequences called\norigins of replication where replication begins. In E. coli, which has a single origin of replication on its one chromosome\n(as do most prokaryotes), it is approximately 245 base pairs long and is rich in AT sequences. The origin of replication is\nrecognized by certain proteins that bind to this site. An enzyme called helicase unwinds the DNA by breaking the hydrogen\nbonds between the nitrogenous base pairs. ATP hydrolysis is required for this process. As the DNA opens up, Y-shaped\nstructures called replication forks are formed. Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get\nextended bi- directionally as replication proceeds. Single-strand binding proteins coat the single strands of DNA near the\nreplication fork to prevent the single-stranded DNA from winding back into a double helix. DNA polymerase is able to add\nnucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction (a new DNA strand can be only extended in this direction). It also requires a free\n3'-OH group to which it can add nucleotides by forming a phosphodiester bond between the 3'-OH end and the 5' phosphate\nof the next nucleotide. This essentially means that it cannot add nucleotides if a free 3'-OH group is not available. Then how\ndoes it add the first nucleotide? The problem is solved with the help of a primer that provides the free 3'-OH end. Another\nenzyme, RNA primase, synthesizes an RNA primer that is about five to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the\nDNA. Because this sequence primes the DNA synthesis, it is appropriately called the primer. DNA polymerase can now\nextend this RNA primer, adding nucleotides one by one that are complementary to the template strand (Figure 14.14).\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\n563\nFigure 14.14 A replication fork is formed when helicase separates the DNA strands at the origin of replication.\nThe DNA tends to become more highly coiled ahead of the replication fork. Topoisomerase breaks and reforms\nDNA\u2019s phosphate backbone ahead of the replication fork, thereby relieving the pressure that results from this\nsupercoiling. Single-strand binding proteins bind to the single-stranded DNA to prevent the helix from re-forming.\nPrimase synthesizes an RNA primer. DNA polymerase III uses this primer to synthesize the daughter DNA strand.\nOn the leading strand, DNA is synthesized continuously, whereas on the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in\nshort stretches called Okazaki fragments. DNA polymerase I replaces the RNA primer with DNA. DNA ligase seals\nthe gaps between the Okazaki fragments, joining the fragments into a single DNA molecule. (credit: modification\nof work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nYou isolate a cell strain in which the joining together of Okazaki fragments is impaired and suspect that a mutation has\noccurred in an enzyme found at the replication fork. Which enzyme is most likely to be mutated?\na.\nDNA ligase\nb.\nDNA polymerase III\nc.\nhelicase\nd.\ntopoisomerase\nThe replication fork moves at the rate of 1000 nucleotides per second. DNA polymerase can only extend in the 5' to 3'\ndirection, which poses a slight problem at the replication fork. As we know, the DNA double helix is anti-parallel; that is,\none strand is in the 5' to 3' direction and the other is oriented in the 3' to 5' direction. One strand, which is complementary\nto the 3' to 5' parental DNA strand, is synthesized continuously towards the replication fork because the polymerase can\nadd nucleotides in this direction. This continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand. The other strand,\ncomplementary to the 5' to 3' parental DNA, is extended away from the replication fork, in small fragments known as\nOkazaki fragments, each requiring a primer to start the synthesis. Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese scientist\nwho first discovered them. The strand with the Okazaki fragments is known as the lagging strand.\nThe leading strand can be extended by one primer alone, whereas the lagging strand needs a new primer for each of the\nshort Okazaki fragments. The overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3' to 5', and that of the leading strand 5' to 3'. A\nprotein called the sliding clamp holds the DNA polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides. The sliding clamp is\na ring-shaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place. Topoisomerase prevents the over-winding\nof the DNA double helix ahead of the replication fork as the DNA is opening up; it does so by causing temporary nicks\nin the DNA helix and then resealing it. As synthesis proceeds, the RNA primers are replaced by DNA. The primers are\nremoved by the exonuclease activity of DNA pol I, and the gaps are filled in by deoxyribonucleotides. The nicks that remain\nbetween the newly synthesized DNA (that replaced the RNA primer) and the previously synthesized DNA are sealed by the\nenzyme DNA ligase that catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester linkage between the 3'-OH end of one nucleotide and\nthe 5' phosphate end of the other fragment.\nOnce the chromosome has been completely replicated, the two DNA copies move into two different cells during cell\ndivision. The process of DNA replication can be summarized as follows:\n1.\nDNA unwinds at the origin of replication.\n564\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\n2.\nHelicase opens up the DNA-forming replication forks; these are extended bidirectionally.\n3.\nSingle-strand binding proteins coat the DNA around the replication fork to prevent rewinding of the DNA.\n4.\nTopoisomerase binds at the region ahead of the replication fork to prevent supercoiling.\n5.\nPrimase synthesizes RNA primers complementary to the DNA strand.\n6.\nDNA polymerase starts adding nucleotides to the 3'-OH end of the primer.\n7.\nElongation of both the lagging and the leading strand continues.\n8.\nRNA primers are removed by exonuclease activity.\n9.\nGaps are filled by DNA pol by adding dNTPs.\n10.\nThe gap between the two DNA fragments is sealed by DNA ligase, which helps in the formation of phosphodiester\nbonds.\nTable 14.1 summarizes the enzymes involved in prokaryotic DNA replication and the functions of each.\nProkaryotic DNA Replication: Enzymes and Their Functions\nEnzyme/protein\nSpecific Function\nDNA pol I\nExonuclease activity removes RNA primer and replaces with newly\nsynthesized DNA\nDNA pol II\nRepair function\nDNA pol III\nMain enzyme that adds nucleotides in the 5'-3' direction\nHelicase\nOpens the DNA helix by breaking hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous\nbases\nLigase\nSeals the gaps between the Okazaki fragments to create one continuous DNA\nstrand\nPrimase\nSynthesizes RNA primers needed to start replication\nSliding Clamp\nHelps to hold the DNA polymerase in place when nucleotides are being added\nTopoisomerase\nHelps relieve the stress on DNA when unwinding by causing breaks and then\nresealing the DNA\nSingle-strand binding\nproteins (SSB)\nBinds to single-stranded DNA to avoid DNA rewinding back.\nTable 14.1\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\n565\nReview the full process of DNA replication here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/replication_DNA) .\nExplain why errors in DNA replication are rare events in cells.\na.\nErrors in DNA replication are rare events in a cell due to the presence of DNA ligase enzyme which fixes\nmistakes in the copying process.\nb.\nPolymerase I is solely responsible for proofreading and fixing mistakes in the copying process, which\nexplains why so few mistakes are made.\nc.\nPolymerase I and II are responsible for proofreading and fixing mistakes in the copying process which\nexplains why errors in DNA replication are rare.\nd.\nErrors in DNA replication are rare events in cells due to the action of DNA helicase.\nActivity\nUse the model of DNA you constructed in Section 14.2 to demonstrate the process of replication in\nprokaryotes, showing how the activities differ on the leading and lagging strands.

        "summary": "In prokaryotes, DNA replication begins at a single origin of replication, a specific AT-rich sequence recognized by proteins that recruit helicase to unwind the DNA, forming two bidirectional replication forks. Single-strand binding proteins stabilize the unwound strands, and topoisomerase relieves supercoiling ahead of the forks. Primase synthesizes short RNA primers to provide free 3'-OH ends for DNA polymerase III, which extends new DNA strands in the 5' to 3' direction\u2014continuously on the leading strand toward the fork, and discontinuously on the lagging strand away from the fork in short Okazaki fragments, each requiring its own primer. DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers via exonuclease activity and replaces them with DNA, and DNA ligase seals the nicks to form continuous strands. The sliding clamp holds DNA polymerase in place for efficient elongation. E. coli\u2019s single circular chromosome of 4.6 million base pairs is replicated in about 42 minutes at a rate of roughly 1000 nucleotides per second, producing two identical DNA molecules, each with one parental and one newly synthesized strand."

There are multiple origins of replication on the eukaryotic chromosome; humans can have up to 100,000 origins of\nreplication. The rate of replication is approximately 100 nucleotides per second, much slower than prokaryotic replication.\n566\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nIn yeast, which is a eukaryote, special sequences known as Autonomously Replicating Sequences (ARS) are found on the\nchromosomes. These are equivalent to the origin of replication in E. coli.\nThe number of DNA polymerases in eukaryotes is much more than prokaryotes: 14 are known, of which five are known to\nhave major roles during replication and have been well studied. They are known as pol \u03b1, pol \u03b2, pol \u03b3, pol \u03b4, and pol \u03b5.\nThe essential steps of replication are the same as in prokaryotes. Before replication can start, the DNA has to be made\navailable as template. Eukaryotic DNA is bound to basic proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes.\nThe chromatin (the complex between DNA and proteins) may undergo some chemical modifications, so that the DNA\nmay be able to slide off the proteins or be accessible to the enzymes of the DNA replication machinery. At the origin of\nreplication, a pre-replication complex is made with other initiator proteins. Other proteins are then recruited to start the\nreplication process (Table 14.2).\nA helicase using the energy from ATP hydrolysis opens up the DNA helix. Replication forks are formed at each replication\norigin as the DNA unwinds. The opening of the double helix causes over-winding, or supercoiling, in the DNA ahead of\nthe replication fork. These are resolved with the action of topoisomerases. Primers are formed by the enzyme primase, and\nusing the primer, DNA pol can start synthesis. While the leading strand is continuously synthesized by the enzyme pol \u03b4,\nthe lagging strand is synthesized by pol \u03b5. A sliding clamp protein known as PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)\nholds the DNA pol in place so that it does not slide off the DNA. RNase H removes the RNA primer, which is then replaced\nwith DNA nucleotides. The Okazaki fragments in the lagging strand are joined together after the replacement of the RNA\nprimers with DNA. The gaps that remain are sealed by DNA ligase, which forms the phosphodiester bond.\nTelomere Replication\nUnlike prokaryotic chromosomes, eukaryotic chromosomes are linear. As you\u2019ve learned, the enzyme DNA pol can add\nnucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction. In the leading strand, synthesis continues until the end of the chromosome is\nreached. On the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches, each of which is initiated by a separate primer. When\nthe replication fork reaches the end of the linear chromosome, there is no place for a primer to be made for the DNA\nfragment to be copied at the end of the chromosome. These ends thus remain unpaired, and over time these ends may get\nprogressively shorter as cells continue to divide.\nThe ends of the linear chromosomes are known as telomeres, which have repetitive sequences that code for no particular\ngene. In a way, these telomeres protect the genes from getting deleted as cells continue to divide. In humans, a six base\npair sequence, TTAGGG, is repeated 100 to 1000 times. The discovery of the enzyme telomerase (Figure 14.16) helped in\nthe understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained. The telomerase enzyme contains a catalytic part and a built-in\nRNA template. It attaches to the end of the chromosome, and complementary bases to the RNA template are added on the\n3' end of the DNA strand. Once the 3' end of the lagging strand template is sufficiently elongated, DNA polymerase can add\nthe nucleotides complementary to the ends of the chromosomes. Thus, the ends of the chromosomes are replicated.\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\n567\nFigure 14.15 The ends of linear chromosomes are maintained by the action of the telomerase enzyme.\nTelomerase is typically active in germ cells and adult stem cells. It is not active in adult somatic cells. For her discovery\nof telomerase and its action, Elizabeth Blackburn (Figure 14.16) received the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology in\n2009.\nFigure 14.16 Elizabeth Blackburn, 2009 Nobel Laureate, is the scientist who discovered how telomerase works.\n(credit: US Embassy Sweden)\nTelomerase and Aging\nCells that undergo cell division continue to have their telomeres shortened because most somatic cells do not make\ntelomerase. This essentially means that telomere shortening is associated with aging. With the advent of modern medicine,\npreventative health care, and healthier lifestyles, the human life span has increased, and there is an increasing demand for\npeople to look younger and have a better quality of life as they grow older.\nIn 2010, scientists found that telomerase can reverse some age-related conditions in mice. This may have potential in\nregenerative medicine.\n[2] Telomerase-deficient mice were used in these studies; these mice have tissue atrophy, stem\ncell depletion, organ system failure, and impaired tissue injury responses. Telomerase reactivation in these mice caused\n568\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nextension of telomeres, reduced DNA damage, reversed neurodegeneration, and improved the function of the testes, spleen,\nand intestines. Thus, telomere reactivation may have potential for treating age-related diseases in humans.\nCancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell division of abnormal cells. The cells accumulate mutations, proliferate\nuncontrollably, and can migrate to different parts of the body through a process called metastasis. Scientists have observed\nthat cancerous cells have considerably shortened telomeres and that telomerase is active in these cells. Interestingly, only\nafter the telomeres were shortened in the cancer cells did the telomerase become active. If the action of telomerase in these\ncells can be inhibited by drugs during cancer therapy, then the cancerous cells could potentially be stopped from further\ndivision.\nDifference between Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Replication\nProperty\nProkaryotes\nEukaryotes\nOrigin of replication\nSingle\nMultiple\nRate of replication\n1000 nucleotides/s\n50 to 100 nucleotides/s\nDNA polymerase types\n5\n14\nTelomerase\nNot present\nPresent\nRNA primer removal\nDNA pol I\nRNase H\nStrand elongation\nDNA pol III\nPol \u03b4, pol \u03b5\nSliding clamp\nSliding clamp\nPCNA\nTable 14.2\n14.6 | DNA Repair\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are different types of mutations in DNA and the significance of mutations?\n\u2022\nWhat are examples of mechanisms that repair mutations in DNA?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nDNA polymerase is an efficient enzyme but it can make mistakes while adding nucleotides during replication.

        "summary": "Eukaryotic DNA replication is more complex and slower than in prokaryotes due to the larger genome size and chromatin structure, with humans possessing up to 100,000 origins of replication and a replication rate of about 100 nucleotides per second. Eukaryotes have 14 known DNA polymerases, with pol \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, and \u03b5 playing major roles. Before replication, chromatin may be chemically modified to allow access to DNA; replication begins at multiple origins with the formation of a pre-replication complex. Helicase unwinds the DNA, topoisomerases relieve supercoiling, primase synthesizes primers, and replication proceeds continuously on the leading strand via pol \u03b4 and discontinuously on the lagging strand via pol \u03b5, with PCNA acting as a sliding clamp. RNA primers are removed by RNase H, replaced with DNA, and Okazaki fragments are joined by ligase. Eukaryotic chromosomes are linear and end in telomeres, repetitive non-coding sequences that protect genes; telomerase, active in germ and stem cells but not most somatic cells, maintains telomere length using an RNA template, counteracting shortening that occurs during division. Telomere shortening is linked to aging, while telomerase reactivation has shown potential to reverse degenerative conditions in mice and is active in many cancer cells, making it a possible therapeutic target."

Uncorrected mistakes may sometimes lead to serious consequences, such as cancer. Repair mechanisms correct\nthe mistakes. In rare cases, mistakes are not corrected, leading to mutations; in other cases, repair enzymes are themselves\nmutated or defective.\nMost of the mistakes during DNA replication are promptly corrected by DNA polymerase by proofreading the base that has\nbeen just added (Figure 14.17). In proofreading, the DNA pol reads the newly added base before adding the next one, so\na correction can be made. The polymerase checks whether the newly added base has paired correctly with the base in the\ntemplate strand. If it is the right base, the next nucleotide is added. If an incorrect base has been added, the enzyme makes a\ncut at the phosphodiester bond and releases the wrong nucleotide. This is performed by the exonuclease action of DNA pol\nIII. Once the incorrect nucleotide has been removed, a new one will be added again.\nFigure 14.17 Proofreading by DNA polymerase corrects errors during replication.\nSome errors are not corrected during replication, but are instead corrected after replication is completed; this type of repair\nis known as mismatch repair (Figure 14.18). The enzymes recognize the incorrectly added nucleotide and excise it; this\nis then replaced by the correct base. If this remains uncorrected, it may lead to more permanent damage. How do mismatch\nrepair enzymes recognize which of the two bases is the incorrect one? In E. coli, after replication, the nitrogenous base\n570\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nadenine acquires a methyl group; the parental DNA strand will have methyl groups, whereas the newly synthesized strand\nlacks them. Thus, DNA polymerase is able to remove the wrongly incorporated bases from the newly synthesized, non-\nmethylated strand. In eukaryotes, the mechanism is not very well understood, but it is believed to involve recognition of\nunsealed nicks in the new strand, as well as a short-term continuing association of some of the replication proteins with the\nnew daughter strand after replication has completed.\nFigure 14.18 In mismatch repair, the incorrectly added base is detected after replication. The mismatch repair proteins\ndetect this base and remove it from the newly synthesized strand by nuclease action. The gap is now filled with the\ncorrectly paired base.\nIn another type of repair mechanism, nucleotide excision repair, enzymes replace incorrect bases by making a cut on both\nthe 3' and 5' ends of the incorrect base (Figure 14.19). The segment of DNA is removed and replaced with the correctly\npaired nucleotides by the action of DNA pol. Once the bases are filled in, the remaining gap is sealed with a phosphodiester\nlinkage catalyzed by DNA ligase. This repair mechanism is often employed when UV exposure causes the formation of\npyrimidine dimers.\nFigure 14.19 Nucleotide excision repairs thymine dimers. When exposed to UV, thymines lying adjacent to each other\ncan form thymine dimers. In normal cells, they are excised and replaced.\nA well-studied example of mistakes not being corrected is seen in people suffering from xeroderma pigmentosa (Figure\n14.20). Affected individuals have skin that is highly sensitive to UV rays from the sun. When individuals are exposed\nto UV, pyrimidine dimers, especially those of thymine, are formed; people with xeroderma pigmentosa are not able to\nrepair the damage. These are not repaired because of a defect in the nucleotide excision repair enzymes, whereas in normal\nindividuals, the thymine dimers are excised and the defect is corrected. The thymine dimers distort the structure of the DNA\ndouble helix, and this may cause problems during DNA replication.\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\n571\nFigure 14.20 Xeroderma pigmentosa is a condition in which thymine dimerization from exposure to UV is not repaired.\nExposure to sunlight results in skin lesions. (credit: James Halpern et al.)\nErrors during DNA replication are not the only reason why mutations arise in DNA. Mutations, variations in the nucleotide\nsequence of a genome, can also occur because of damage to DNA. Such mutations may be of two types: induced or\nspontaneous. Induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals, UV rays, x-rays, or some other\nenvironmental agent. Spontaneous mutations occur without any exposure to any environmental agent; they are a result of\nnatural reactions taking place within the body.\nMutations may have a wide range of effects. Some mutations are not expressed; these are known as silent mutations. Point\nmutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair. The most common nucleotide mutations are substitutions,\nin which one base is replaced by another. These can be of two types, either transitions or transversions. Transition\nsubstitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind; for example, a purine such\nas adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine. Transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a\npyrimidine, or vice versa; for example, cytosine, a pyrimidine, is replaced by adenine, a purine. Mutations can also be the\nresult of the addition of a base, known as an insertion, or the removal of a base, also known as deletion. Sometimes a piece\nof DNA from one chromosome may get translocated to another chromosome or to another region of the same chromosome;\nthis is also known as translocation. These mutation types are shown in Figure 14.22.\n572\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nSometimes a nucleotide is overlooked by the DNA repair system for no known reason. This malignant\nmelanoma is the result of DNA not undergoing repair after too much UV exposure.\nFigure 14.21\nWhich statement about the above malignant melanoma is most likely true?\na.\nit was the result of a spontaneous mutation\nb.\nit was caused by thymine dimer formation\nc.\nit was caused by a transition substitution\nd.\nit was caused by a transversion substitution\nChapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function\n573\nFigure 14.22 Mutations can lead to changes in the protein sequence encoded by the DNA.\nA frameshift mutation that results in the insertion of three nucleotides is often less deleterious than a mutation that\nresults in the insertion of one nucleotide. Why?\na.\nAddition of three nucleotides does not shift the reading frame.\nb.\nAddition of three nucleotides shifts the reading frame.\nc.\nAddition of three nucleotides incorporates two amino acids.\nd.\nAddition of three nucleotides removes two amino acids.\nMutations in repair genes have been known to cause cancer. Many mutated repair genes have been implicated in certain\nforms of pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and colorectal cancer. Mutations can affect either somatic cells or germ cells. If\nmany mutations accumulate in a somatic cell, they may lead to problems such as the uncontrolled cell division observed\nin cancer.

        "summary": "DNA polymerase is highly accurate but can make mistakes during DNA replication, which are usually corrected by proofreading, where the enzyme removes and replaces incorrectly paired bases. Additional repair mechanisms include mismatch repair, which detects and excises mismatched bases after replication using molecular cues like DNA methylation in prokaryotes, and nucleotide excision repair, which removes damaged DNA segments such as UV-induced thymine dimers and replaces them with correct bases. Failure of these systems can lead to mutations\u2014permanent DNA sequence changes\u2014which may be induced by environmental factors like radiation or chemicals, or arise spontaneously from natural processes. Mutations can be silent, substitutions (transitions or transversions), insertions, deletions, or translocations, and may affect somatic or germ cells. Defects in repair genes or the accumulation of mutations can lead to severe consequences such as cancer, inherited disorders like xeroderma pigmentosum and hemophilia, or infertility in cases of certain chromosome translocations. While mutations can be harmful, they also contribute to genetic variation, which is essential to evolution."

Currently, we can perform\ntests for many genetic diseases, but these tests create ethical and legal issues. For example, would you want to be tested\nfor a debilitating genetic disease if there was the possibility insurance companies could use that information to deny\nyou coverage? Fortunately, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 protects American citizens from\ndiscrimination from both insurance companies and employers based on genetic information. More information about policy,\nlegal, and ethical issues in genetic research can be found here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32genomegov) .\n15.1 | The Genetic Code\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat is the \u201cCentral Dogma\u201d of protein synthesis?\n\u2022\nWhat is the genetic code, and how does nucleotide sequence prescribe the amino acid and polypeptide sequence?\nChapter 15 | Genes and Proteins\n593\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nSince the rediscovery of Mendel\u2019s work in the 1900s, scientists have learned much about how the genetic blueprints stored\nin DNA are capable of replication, expression, and mutation. Just as the 26 letters of the English alphabet can be arranged\ninto what seems to be a limitless number of words, with new ones added to the dictionary every year, the four nucleotides of\nDNA\u2014A, T, C, and G\u2014can generate sequences of DNA called genes that specify tens of thousands of polymers of amino\nacids. In turn, these sequences can be transcribed into mRNA and translated into proteins which orchestrate nearly every\nfunction of the cell. The genetic code refers to the DNA alphabet (A, T, C, G), the RNA alphabet (A, U, C, G), and the\npolypeptide alphabet (20 amino acids). But how do genes located on a chromosome ultimately produce a polypeptide that\ncan result in a physical phenotype such as hair or eye color\u2014or a disease like cystic fibrosis or hemophilia?\nThe Central Dogma describes the normal flow of genetic information from DNA to mRNA to protein: DNA in genes specify\nsequences of mRNA which, in turn, specify amino acid sequences in proteins. The process requires two steps, transcription\nand translation. During transcription, genes are used to make messenger RNA (mRNA). In turn, the mRNA is used to\ndirect the synthesis of proteins during the process of translation. Translation also requires two other types of RNA: transfer\nRNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The genetic code is a triplet code, with each RNA codon consisting of three\nconsecutive nucleotides that specify one amino acid or the release of the newly formed polypeptide chain; for example, the\nmRNA codon CAU specifies the amino acid histidine. The code is degenerate; that is, some amino acids are specified by\nmore than one codon, like synonyms you study in your English class (different word, same meaning). For example, CCU,\nCCC, CCA, and CCG are all codons for proline. It is important to remember the same genetic code is universal to almost\nall organisms on Earth. Small variations in codon assignment exist in mitochondria and some microorganisms.\nDeviations from the simple scheme of the central dogma are discovered as researchers explore gene expression with new\ntechnology. For example the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus which stores its genetic information in\nsingle stranded RNA molecules. Upon infection of a host cell, RNA is used as a template by the virally encoded enzyme,\nreverse transcriptase, to synthesize DNA. The viral DNA is later transcribed into mRNA and translated into proteins.\nSome RNA viruses such as the influenza virus never go through a DNA step. The RNA genome is replicated by an RNA\ndependent RNA polymerase which is virally encoded.\nThe content presented in this section supports the Learning Objectives outlined in Big Idea 1 and Big Idea 3 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 3.4][APLO 3.25]\nThe cellular process of transcription generates messenger RNA (mRNA), a mobile molecular copy of one or more\ngenes with an alphabet of A, C, G, and uracil (U). Translation of the mRNA template converts nucleotide-based genetic\ninformation into a protein product. Protein sequences consist of 20 commonly occurring amino acids; therefore, it can be\nsaid that the protein alphabet consists of 20 letters (Figure 15.2). Each amino acid is defined by a three-nucleotide sequence\ncalled the triplet codon. Different amino acids have different chemistries (such as acidic versus basic, or polar and nonpolar)\nand different structural constraints. Variation in amino acid sequence gives rise to enormous variation in protein structure\nand function.\nFigure 15.2 Structures of the 20 amino acids found in proteins are shown. Each amino acid is composed of an amino\ngroup ( NH3\n+ ), a carboxyl group (COO-), and a side chain (blue). The side chain may be nonpolar, polar, or charged,\nas well as large or small. It is the variety of amino acid side chains that gives rise to the incredible variation of protein\nstructure and function.\nChapter 15 | Genes and Proteins\n595\nThe Central Dogma: DNA Encodes RNA; RNA Encodes Protein\nThe flow of genetic information in cells from DNA to mRNA to protein is described by the Central Dogma (Figure 15.3),\nwhich states that genes specify the sequence of mRNAs, which in turn specify the sequence of proteins. The decoding of\none molecule to another is performed by specific proteins and RNAs. Because the information stored in DNA is so central\nto cellular function, it makes intuitive sense that the cell would make mRNA copies of this information for protein synthesis,\nwhile keeping the DNA itself intact and protected. The copying of DNA to RNA is relatively straightforward, with one\nnucleotide being added to the mRNA strand for every nucleotide read in the DNA strand. The translation to protein is a bit\nmore complex because three mRNA nucleotides correspond to one amino acid in the polypeptide sequence. However, the\ntranslation to protein is still systematic and colinear, such that nucleotides 1 to 3 correspond to amino acid 1, nucleotides 4\nto 6 correspond to amino acid 2, and so on.\nFigure 15.3 Instructions on DNA are transcribed onto messenger RNA. Ribosomes are able to read the genetic\ninformation inscribed on a strand of messenger RNA and use this information to string amino acids together into a\nprotein.\nThe Genetic Code Is Degenerate and Universal\nGiven the different numbers of \u201cletters\u201d in the mRNA and protein \u201calphabets,\u201d scientists theorized that combinations of\nnucleotides corresponded to single amino acids. Nucleotide doublets would not be sufficient to specify every amino acid\nbecause there are only 16 possible two-nucleotide combinations (42). In contrast, there are 64 possible nucleotide triplets\n(43), which is far more than the number of amino acids. Scientists theorized that amino acids were encoded by nucleotide\ntriplets and that the genetic code was degenerate. In other words, a given amino acid could be encoded by more than one\nnucleotide triplet. This was later confirmed experimentally; Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner used the chemical mutagen\nproflavin to insert one, two, or three nucleotides into the gene of a virus. When one or two nucleotides were inserted, protein\nsynthesis was completely abolished. When three nucleotides were inserted, the protein was synthesized and functional. This\n596\nChapter 15 | Genes and Proteins\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\ndemonstrated that three nucleotides specify each amino acid. These nucleotide triplets are called codons. The insertion of\none or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame, thereby altering the message for every subsequent\namino acid (Figure 15.4). Though insertion of three nucleotides caused an extra amino acid to be inserted during translation,\nthe integrity of the rest of the protein was maintained.\nFigure 15.4 The deletion of two nucleotides shifts the reading frame of an mRNA and changes the entire protein\nmessage, creating a nonfunctional protein or terminating protein synthesis altogether.\nScientists painstakingly solved the genetic code by translating synthetic mRNAs in vitro and sequencing the proteins they\nspecified (Figure 15.5).\nFigure 15.5 This figure shows the genetic code for translating each nucleotide triplet in mRNA into an amino acid or a\ntermination signal in a nascent protein. (credit: modification of work by NIH)\nIn addition to instructing the addition of a specific amino acid to a polypeptide chain, three of the 64 codons terminate\nprotein synthesis and release the polypeptide from the translation machinery. These triplets are called nonsense codons, or\nstop codons. Another codon, AUG, also has a special function. In addition to specifying the amino acid methionine, it also\nserves as the start codon to initiate translation. The reading frame for translation is set by the AUG start codon near the 5'\nend of the mRNA.\nThe genetic code is universal. With a few exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for protein synthesis.\nConservation of codons means that a purified mRNA encoding the globin protein in horses could be transferred to a tulip\ncell, and the tulip would synthesize horse globin. That there is only one genetic code is powerful evidence that all of life on\nEarth shares a common origin, especially considering that there are about 1084 possible combinations of 20 amino acids and\n64 triplet codons.\nChapter 15 | Genes and Proteins\n597\nTranscribe a gene and translate it to protein using complementary pairing and the genetic code at this site\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/create_protein) .\nSome hereditary and age-related diseases are caused by translation errors. Explain why an error in translation may\ncause disease.\na.\nIf there is an error in translation, the correct lipids will not be made for signaling, storage of energy or to\nperform vital functions. This can cause hereditary and age-related diseases.\nb.\nTranslation is the process in which a particular segment of DNA is copied into RNA (mRNA) by the enzyme\nRNA polymerase. Error in such copying can lead to various hereditary and age-related diseases.\nc.\nTranslation is the process used by ribosomes to synthesize proteins from amino acids. If there is an error in\nthis process, the correct proteins will not be made to build important body tissue or perform vital functions\nthus leading to hereditary and age-related diseases.\nd.\nTranslation is the process Golgi bodies use to synthesize proteins from amino acids. If there is an error in\nthis process, the correct proteins will not be made to build important body tissue or perform vital functions.\nThink About It\n\u2022\nA strand of DNA has the nucleotide sequence 3'\u2026\u2026GCT GTC AAA TTC GAT\u2026\u20265'. What is the sequence\nof mRNA that is complementary to this DNA sequence? Using the chart of codons in the text, determine the\nsequence of amino acids which can be generated from this strand of DNA.\n\u2022\nHow does degeneracy of the genetic code make cells less vulnerable to mutations? What is an advantage of\ndegeneracy with respect to the negative impact of random mutations on natural selection and evolution?\nDegeneracy is believed to be a cellular mechanism to reduce the negative impact of random mutations. Codons that specify\nthe same amino acid typically only differ by one nucleotide. In addition, amino acids with chemically similar side chains\nare encoded by similar codons. This nuance of the genetic code ensures that a single-nucleotide substitution mutation might\neither specify the same amino acid but have no effect or specify a similar amino acid, preventing the protein from being\nrendered completely nonfunctional.\nWhich Has More DNA: A Kiwi or a Strawberry?\n598\nChapter 15 | Genes and Proteins\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 15.6 Do you think that a kiwi or a strawberry has more DNA per fruit?

All mammals are diploid, meaning they have\ntwo copies of each chromosome. However, not all plants are diploid. The common strawberry is octoploid (8n) and\nthe cultivated kiwi is hexaploid (6n). Research the total number of chromosomes in the cells of each of these fruits and\nthink about how this might correspond to the amount of DNA in these fruits\u2019 cell nuclei. Read about the technique of\nDNA isolation to understand how each step in the isolation protocol helps liberate and precipitate DNA.\nHypothesis: Hypothesize whether you would be able to detect a difference in DNA quantity from similarly sized\nstrawberries and kiwis. Which fruit do you think would yield more DNA?\nTest your hypothesis: Isolate the DNA from a strawberry and a kiwi that are similarly sized. Perform the experiment\nin at least triplicate for each fruit.\n1.\nPrepare a bottle of DNA extraction buffer from 900 mL water, 50 mL dish detergent, and two teaspoons of table\nsalt. Mix by inversion (cap it and turn it upside down a few times).\n2.\nGrind a strawberry and a kiwifruit by hand in a plastic bag, or using a mortar and pestle, or with a metal bowl and\nthe end of a blunt instrument. Grind for at least two minutes per fruit.\n3.\nAdd 10 mL of the DNA extraction buffer to each fruit, and mix well for at least one minute.\n4.\nRemove cellular debris by filtering each fruit mixture through cheesecloth or porous cloth and into a funnel placed\nin a test tube or an appropriate container.\n5.\nPour ice-cold ethanol or isopropanol (rubbing alcohol) into the test tube. You should observe white, precipitated\nDNA.\n6.\nGather the DNA from each fruit by winding it around separate glass rods.\nRecord your observations: Because you are not quantitatively measuring DNA volume, you can record for each trial\nwhether the two fruits produced the same or different amounts of DNA as observed by eye. If one or the other fruit\nproduced noticeably more DNA, record this as well. Determine whether your observations are consistent with several\npieces of each fruit.\nAnalyze your data: Did you notice an obvious difference in the amount of DNA produced by each fruit? Were your\nresults reproducible?\nDraw a conclusion: Given what you know about the number of chromosomes in each fruit, can you conclude that\nchromosome number necessarily correlates to DNA amount? Can you identify any drawbacks to this procedure?

A bacterial chromosome is a covalently closed circle that, unlike eukaryotic\nchromosomes, is not organized around histone proteins. The central region of the cell in which prokaryotic DNA resides is\ncalled the nucleoid. In addition, prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids, which are shorter circular DNA molecules that\nmay only contain one or a few genes. Plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell\ndivision and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance.\nTranscription in prokaryotes (and in eukaryotes) requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA\nsynthesis. The region of unwinding is called a transcription bubble. Transcription always proceeds from the same DNA\nstrand for each gene, which is called the template strand. The mRNA product is complementary to the template strand and\nis almost identical to the other DNA strand, called the nontemplate strand. The only difference is that in mRNA, all of the\nT nucleotides are replaced with U nucleotides. In an RNA double helix, A can bind U via two hydrogen bonds, just as in\nA\u2013T pairing in a DNA double helix.\nThe nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5' mRNA nucleotide is\ntranscribed is called the +1 site, or the initiation site.

Plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell\ndivision and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance.\nTranscription in prokaryotes (and in eukaryotes) requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA\nsynthesis. The region of unwinding is called a transcription bubble. Transcription always proceeds from the same DNA\nstrand for each gene, which is called the template strand. The mRNA product is complementary to the template strand and\nis almost identical to the other DNA strand, called the nontemplate strand. The only difference is that in mRNA, all of the\nT nucleotides are replaced with U nucleotides. In an RNA double helix, A can bind U via two hydrogen bonds, just as in\nA\u2013T pairing in a DNA double helix.\nThe nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5' mRNA nucleotide is\ntranscribed is called the +1 site, or the initiation site. Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers\nand are designated upstream. Conversely, nucleotides following the initiation site are denoted with \u201c+\u201d numbering and are\n600\nChapter 15 | Genes and Proteins\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\ncalled downstream nucleotides.\nInitiation of Transcription in Prokaryotes\nProkaryotes do not have membrane-enclosed nuclei. Therefore, the processes of transcription, translation, and mRNA\ndegradation can all occur simultaneously. The intracellular level of a bacterial protein can quickly be amplified by multiple\ntranscription and translation events occurring concurrently on the same DNA template. Prokaryotic transcription often\ncovers more than one gene and produces polycistronic mRNAs that specify more than one protein.\nOur discussion here will exemplify transcription by describing this process in Escherichia coli, a well-studied bacterial\nspecies. Although some differences exist between transcription in E. coli and transcription in archaea, an understanding of\nE. coli transcription can be applied to virtually all bacterial species.\nProkaryotic RNA Polymerase\nProkaryotes use the same RNA polymerase to transcribe all of their genes. In E. coli, the polymerase is composed of five\npolypeptide subunits, two of which are identical. Four of these subunits, denoted \u03b1, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b2' comprise the polymerase\ncore enzyme. These subunits assemble every time a gene is transcribed, and they disassemble once transcription is\ncomplete. Each subunit has a unique role; the two \u03b1-subunits are necessary to assemble the polymerase on the DNA; the\n\u03b2-subunit binds to the ribonucleoside triphosphate that will become part of the nascent \u201crecently born\u201d mRNA molecule;\nand the \u03b2' binds the DNA template strand. The fifth subunit, \u03c3, is involved only in transcription initiation. It confers\ntranscriptional specificity such that the polymerase begins to synthesize mRNA from an appropriate initiation site. Without\n\u03c3, the core enzyme would transcribe from random sites and would produce mRNA molecules that specified protein\ngibberish. The polymerase comprised of all five subunits is called the holoenzyme.\nProkaryotic Promoters\nA promoter is a DNA sequence onto which the transcription machinery binds and initiates transcription. In most cases,\npromoters exist upstream of the genes they regulate. The specific sequence of a promoter is very important because\nit determines whether the corresponding gene is transcribed all the time, some of the time, or infrequently. Although\npromoters vary among prokaryotic genomes, a few elements are conserved. At the -10 and -35 regions upstream of the\ninitiation site, there are two promoter consensus sequences, or regions that are similar across all promoters and across\nvarious bacterial species (Figure 15.7). The -10 consensus sequence, called the -10 region, is TATAAT. The -35 sequence,\nTTGACA, is recognized and bound by \u03c3. Once this interaction is made, the subunits of the core enzyme bind to the site.\nThe A\u2013T-rich -10 region facilitates unwinding of the DNA template, and several phosphodiester bonds are made. The\ntranscription initiation phase ends with the production of abortive transcripts, which are polymers of approximately 10\nnucleotides that are made and released.\nFigure 15.7 The \u03c3 subunit of prokaryotic RNA polymerase recognizes consensus sequences found in the promoter\nregion upstream of the transcription start sight. The \u03c3 subunit dissociates from the polymerase after transcription has\nbeen initiated.\nChapter 15 | Genes and Proteins\n601\nView this MolecularMovies animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/transcription) to see the first part of transcription\nand the base sequence repetition of the TATA box.\nMutations can occur in any part of the DNA. What can happen if there is a mutation in the promoter sequence?\na.\nAll processes will carry on as usual. Nothing will be affected.\nb.\nRNA polymerase will not be able to attach.\nc.\nRNA polymerase will bind upstream of the promoter sequence.\nd.\nRNA polymerase will bind downstream of the promoter sequence.\nElongation and Termination in Prokaryotes\nThe transcription elongation phase begins with the release of the \u03c3 subunit from the polymerase. The dissociation of \u03c3 allows\nthe core enzyme to proceed along the DNA template, synthesizing mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction at a rate of approximately\n40 nucleotides per second. As elongation proceeds, the DNA is continuously unwound ahead of the core enzyme and\nrewound behind it (Figure 15.8). The base pairing between DNA and RNA is not stable enough to maintain the stability of\nthe mRNA synthesis components. Instead, the RNA polymerase acts as a stable linker between the DNA template and the\nnascent RNA strands to ensure that elongation is not interrupted prematurely.\nFigure 15.8 During elongation, the prokaryotic RNA polymerase tracks along the DNA template, synthesizes mRNA in\nthe 5' to 3' direction, and unwinds and rewinds the DNA as it is read.\nProkaryotic Termination Signals\nOnce a gene is transcribed, the prokaryotic polymerase needs to be instructed to dissociate from the DNA template and\nliberate the newly made mRNA. Depending on the gene being transcribed, there are two kinds of termination signals. One\nis protein-based and the other is RNA-based. Rho-dependent termination is controlled by the rho protein, which tracks\nalong behind the polymerase on the growing mRNA chain. Near the end of the gene, the polymerase encounters a run of\nG nucleotides on the DNA template and it stalls. As a result, the rho protein collides with the polymerase. The interaction\nwith rho releases the mRNA from the transcription bubble.\nRho-independent termination is controlled by specific sequences in the DNA template strand. As the polymerase nears\nthe end of the gene being transcribed, it encounters a region rich in C\u2013G nucleotides. The mRNA folds back on itself, and\nthe complementary C\u2013G nucleotides bind together. The result is a stable hairpin that causes the polymerase to stall as soon\nas it begins to transcribe a region rich in A\u2013T nucleotides. The complementary U\u2013A region of the mRNA transcript forms\nonly a weak interaction with the template DNA. This, coupled with the stalled polymerase, induces enough instability for\nthe core enzyme to break away and liberate the new mRNA transcript.\n602\nChapter 15 | Genes and Proteins\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nUpon termination, the process of transcription is complete. By the time termination occurs, the prokaryotic transcript would\nalready have been used to begin synthesis of numerous copies of the encoded protein because these processes can occur\nconcurrently. The unification of transcription, translation, and even mRNA degradation is possible because all of these\nprocesses occur in the same 5' to 3' direction, and because there is no membranous compartmentalization in the prokaryotic\ncell (Figure 15.9). In contrast, the presence of a nucleus in eukaryotic cells precludes simultaneous transcription and\ntranslation.\nFigure 15.9 Multiple polymerases can transcribe a single bacterial gene while numerous ribosomes concurrently\ntranslate the mRNA transcripts into polypeptides. In this way, a specific protein can rapidly reach a high concentration\nin the bacterial cell.\nVisit this BioStudio animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/transcription2) to see the process of prokaryotic\ntranscription.\nWhy is the stop codon necessary for translation?\na.\nThe stop codon is the first step in a series of steps to end translation.\nb.\nThe stop codon is necessary to initiate translation.\nc.\nThe stop codon ends translation which allows the polypeptide strand to be released.\nd.\nThe stop codon ends translation in order to initiate transcription.\nActivity\nWorking in small groups, use a model of DNA to demonstrate synthesis transcription of mRNA to other\ngroups in your class. In your demonstration, be sure to distinguish the differences between DNA and RNA,\nthe template and non-template strands of the DNA, the directionality of transcription, and the significance of\npromoters.\nThink About It\nIf mRNA is complementary to the DNA template strand, and the DNA template strand is complementary to the DNA\nnon-template strand, are the base sequences of mRNA and the DNA non-template strand ever identical?

        "summary": "Prokaryotic transcription is the process by which bacteria and archaea synthesize mRNA from DNA without a membrane-bound nucleus, allowing transcription, translation, and mRNA degradation to occur simultaneously. It begins when RNA polymerase holoenzyme, composed of a core enzyme (\u03b1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b2\u2032) and a \u03c3 subunit, binds to a promoter upstream of the gene. Promoters often contain conserved -10 (TATAAT) and -35 (TTGACA) consensus sequences recognized by the \u03c3 factor, which ensures accurate initiation at the +1 site. Once initiation starts, short abortive transcripts are made before \u03c3 dissociates, allowing the core polymerase to elongate the mRNA strand in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction while unwinding and rewinding the DNA template. Termination occurs either through rho-dependent signals, where the rho protein displaces the mRNA from the transcription complex, or rho-independent signals, where a GC-rich hairpin in the mRNA followed by a U-rich region causes the polymerase to stall and release the transcript. In prokaryotes, multiple RNA polymerases and ribosomes can act on the same gene at once, enabling rapid, high-yield protein production."

Eukaryotic pre-\nmRNAs undergo extensive processing after transcription but before translation. For clarity, this module\u2019s discussion of\ntranscription and translation in eukaryotes will use the term \u201cmRNAs\u201d to describe only the mature, processed molecules\nthat are ready to be translated. RNA polymerase II is responsible for transcribing the overwhelming majority of eukaryotic\ngenes.\nRNA polymerase III is also located in the nucleus. This polymerase transcribes a variety of structural RNAs that includes the\n5S pre-rRNA, transfer pre-RNAs (pre-tRNAs), and small nuclear pre- RNAs. The tRNAs have a critical role in translation;\nthey serve as the adaptor molecules between the mRNA template and the growing polypeptide chain. Small nuclear RNAs\nhave a variety of functions, including \u201csplicing\u201d pre-mRNAs and regulating transcription factors.\nA scientist characterizing a new gene can determine which polymerase transcribes it by testing whether the gene is\nexpressed in the presence of a particular mushroom poison, \u03b1-amanitin (Table 15.1). Interestingly, \u03b1-amanitin produced\nby Amanita phalloides, the Death Cap mushroom, affects the three polymerases very differently. RNA polymerase I is\ncompletely insensitive to \u03b1-amanitin, meaning that the polymerase can transcribe DNA in vitro in the presence of this\npoison. In contrast, RNA polymerase II is extremely sensitive to \u03b1-amanitin, and RNA polymerase III is moderately\nsensitive. Knowing the transcribing polymerase can clue a researcher into the general function of the gene being studied.\nBecause RNA polymerase II transcribes the vast majority of genes, we will focus on this polymerase in our subsequent\ndiscussions about eukaryotic transcription factors and promoters.\nStructure of an RNA Polymerase II Promoter\nEukaryotic promoters are much larger and more complex than prokaryotic promoters, but both have a TATA box. For\nexample, in the mouse thymidine kinase gene, the TATA box is located at approximately -30 relative to the initiation (+1)\nsite (Figure 15.10). For this gene, the exact TATA box sequence is TATAAAA, as read in the 5' to 3' direction on the\nnontemplate strand. This sequence is not identical to the E. coli TATA box, but it conserves the A\u2013T rich element. The\nthermostability of A\u2013T bonds is low and this helps the DNA template to locally unwind in preparation for transcription.\nChapter 15 | Genes and Proteins\n605\nFigure 15.10 A generalized promoter of a gene transcribed by RNA polymerase II is shown. Transcription factors\nrecognize the promoter. RNA polymerase II then binds and forms the transcription initiation complex.\nFigure 15.11 Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns that must be spliced out. A 5' cap and 3' poly-A tail are also\nadded.\nA scientist splices a eukaryotic promoter in front of a bacterial gene and inserts the gene in a bacterial chromosome.\nWould you expect the bacterium to transcribe the gene?\na.\nInitially the bacterium will not transcribe it, but will transcribe after 5\u2019 capping.\nb.\nIt will not transcribe it because there is no poly A tail in prokaryotes.\nc.\nNo, prokaryotes use different promoters than eukaryotes.\nd.\nYes, the bacterium would transcribe the eukaryotic gene.\nThe mouse genome includes one gene and two pseudogenes for cytoplasmic thymidine kinase. Pseudogenes are genes that\nhave lost their protein-coding ability or are no longer expressed by the cell. These pseudogenes are copied from mRNA and\n606\nChapter 15 | Genes and Proteins\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nincorporated into the chromosome. For example, the mouse thymidine kinase promoter also has a conserved CAAT box\n(GGCCAATCT) at approximately -80. This sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors. Further\nupstream of the TATA box, eukaryotic promoters may also contain one or more GC-rich boxes (GGCG) or octamer boxes\n(ATTTGCAT). These elements bind cellular factors that increase the efficiency of transcription initiation and are often\nidentified in more \u201cactive\u201d genes that are constantly being expressed by the cell.\nTranscription Factors for RNA Polymerase II\nThe complexity of eukaryotic transcription does not end with the polymerases and promoters. An army of basal transcription\nfactors, enhancers, and silencers also help to regulate the frequency with which pre-mRNA is synthesized from a gene.\nEnhancers and silencers affect the efficiency of transcription but are not necessary for transcription to proceed. Basal\ntranscription factors are crucial in the formation of a preinitiation complex on the DNA template that subsequently recruits\nRNA polymerase II for transcription initiation.\nThe names of the basal transcription factors begin with \u201cTFII\u201d (this is the transcription factor for RNA polymerase II) and\nare specified with the letters A\u2013J. The transcription factors systematically fall into place on the DNA template, with each\none further stabilizing the preinitiation complex and contributing to the recruitment of RNA polymerase II.\nThe processes of bringing RNA polymerases I and III to the DNA template involve slightly less complex collections of\ntranscription factors, but the general theme is the same. Eukaryotic transcription is a tightly regulated process that requires a\nvariety of proteins to interact with each other and with the DNA strand. Although the process of transcription in eukaryotes\ninvolves a greater metabolic investment than in prokaryotes, it ensures that the cell transcribes precisely the pre-mRNAs\nthat it needs for protein synthesis.\nChapter 15 | Genes and Proteins\n607\nDuring human embryonic development, a transcription factor encoded by the SRY gene starts a chain of\nevents, causing the embryo to develop male sex characteristics. This gene is on the Y chromosome in\nhumans and many other mammals. A deletion or mutation of the SRY gene can cause the human embryo to\nnot develop into a male even though the individual has an XY genotype, a condition called Swyer syndrome.\nFigure 15.12 The SYR gene of the Y chromosome produces proteins that lead to the expression of primary sex\ncharacteristics, as shown.\nThe protein product of the SRY gene is a DNA binding protein. Together with a protein called SF1, the SRY protein\nacts as a transcription factor that \u201cturns on\u201d certain genes. Which of the following statements best describes how a\nchange in these two proteins would affect male sexual development?\na.\nA mutation that abolished activity of SF1 would increase the effect of a SRY mutation, making the person\nmore feminine.\nb.\nA mutation that abolished activity of SF1 would cancel out a mutation in SRY, so if both mutations occur\ntogether male sex characteristics would develop normally.\nc.\nA mutation in the SRY protein that abolished activity would result in abnormal development of male sex\ncharacteristics but a mutation of SF1 would not.\nd.\nBoth a mutation in the SRY protein and a mutation in SF1 that abolished activity would result in a lack of\ndevelopment of male sex characteristics.\n608\nChapter 15 | Genes and Proteins\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nThe Evolution of Promoters\nThe evolution of genes may be a familiar concept. Mutations can occur in genes during DNA replication, and\nthe result may or may not be beneficial to the cell. By altering an enzyme, structural protein, or some other\nfactor, the process of mutation can transform functions or physical features. However, eukaryotic promoters\nand other gene regulatory sequences may evolve as well. For instance, consider a gene that, over many\ngenerations, becomes more valuable to the cell. Maybe the gene encodes a structural protein that the cell\nneeds to synthesize in abundance for a certain function. If this is the case, it would be beneficial to the cell\nfor that gene\u2019s promoter to recruit transcription factors more efficiently and increase gene expression.\nScientists examining the evolution of promoter sequences have reported varying results. In part, this is\nbecause it is difficult to infer exactly where a eukaryotic promoter begins and ends. Some promoters occur\nwithin genes; others are located very far upstream, or even downstream, of the genes they are regulating.\nHowever, when researchers limited their examination to human core promoter sequences that were defined\nexperimentally as sequences that bind the preinitiation complex, they found that promoters evolve even\nfaster than protein-coding genes.\nIt is still unclear how promoter evolution might correspond to the evolution of humans or other higher\norganisms. However, the evolution of a promoter to effectively make more or less of a given gene product\nis an intriguing alternative to the evolution of the genes themselves.\n[1]\nAccording to this passage, which of the following has been shown to evolve faster than protein-coding genes?\na.\ncore promoters that bind the preinitiation complex\nb.\ncore promoters that occur within genes\nc.\npromoters that occur far upstream of the gene\nd.\npromoters that occur downstream of a gene\nPromoter Structures for RNA Polymerases I and III\nIn eukaryotes, the conserved promoter elements differ for genes transcribed by RNA polymerases I, II, and III. RNA\npolymerase I transcribes genes that have two GC-rich promoter sequences in the -45 to +20 region. These sequences alone\nare sufficient for transcription initiation to occur, but promoters with additional sequences in the region from -180 to -105\nupstream of the initiation site will further enhance initiation. Genes that are transcribed by RNA polymerase III have\nupstream promoters or promoters that occur within the genes themselves.\nEukaryotic Elongation and Termination\nFollowing the formation of the preinitiation complex, the polymerase is released from the other transcription factors, and\nelongation is allowed to proceed as it does in prokaryotes with the polymerase synthesizing pre-mRNA in the 5' to 3'\ndirection. As discussed previously, RNA polymerase II transcribes the major share of eukaryotic genes, so this section will\nfocus on how this polymerase accomplishes elongation and termination.\nAlthough the enzymatic process of elongation is essentially the same in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the DNA template\nis more complex. When eukaryotic cells are not dividing, their genes exist as a diffuse mass of DNA and proteins\ncalled chromatin. The DNA is tightly packaged around charged histone proteins at repeated intervals. These DNA\u2013histone\ncomplexes, collectively called nucleosomes, are regularly spaced and include 146 nucleotides of DNA wound around eight\nhistones like thread around a spool.\nFor polynucleotide synthesis to occur, the transcription machinery needs to move histones out of the way every time it\nencounters a nucleosome. This is accomplished by a special protein complex called FACT, which stands for \u201cfacilitates\nchromatin transcription.\u201d This complex pulls histones away from the DNA template as the polymerase moves along it. Once\nthe pre-mRNA is synthesized, the FACT complex replaces the histones to recreate the nucleosomes.\nThe termination of transcription is different for the different polymerases. Unlike in prokaryotes, elongation by RNA\npolymerase II in eukaryotes takes place 1,000\u20132,000 nucleotides beyond the end of the gene being transcribed. This pre-\nmRNA tail is subsequently removed by cleavage during mRNA processing. On the other hand, RNA polymerases I and\n1.

Genes transcribed by RNA polymerase I contain a specific 18-nucleotide sequence that is\nrecognized by a termination protein. The process of termination in RNA polymerase III involves an mRNA hairpin similar\nto rho-independent termination of transcription in prokaryotes.\n15.4 | RNA Processing in Eukaryotes\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the steps in eukaryotic transcription?\n\u2022\nWhat are the structural and functional similarities and differences among the three RNA polymerases?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nScientists discovered a strand of mRNA translated into a sequence of amino acids (polypeptide) shorter than the mRNA\nmolecule transcribed from DNA. Before the information in eukaryotic mRNA is translated into protein, it is modified or\nedited in several ways. A 5\u2032 methylguanosine (or GTP) cap and a 3\u2032 poly-A tail are added to protect mature mRNA from\ndegradation and allow its export from the nucleus. Pre-mRNAs also undergo splicing, in which introns are removed and\nexons are reconnected. Exons can be reconnected in different sequences, a phenomenon referred to as alternative gene\nsplicing, which allows a single eukaryotic gene to code for different proteins. (We will explore the significance of alternative\ngene splicing in more detail in other chapters.)\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework.

        "summary": "Eukaryotic transcription is a complex, highly regulated process that occurs within the membrane-bound nucleus and involves three distinct RNA polymerases, each transcribing different types of genes: RNA polymerase I synthesizes most rRNAs (except 5S rRNA) in the nucleolus, RNA polymerase II produces all protein-coding pre-mRNAs in the nucleus, and RNA polymerase III transcribes 5S rRNA, tRNAs, and small nuclear RNAs. Initiation requires transcription factors binding to promoter elements\u2014such as the TATA box, CAAT box, GC-rich boxes, and octamer boxes\u2014which help recruit the correct polymerase to form a preinitiation complex, with enhancers and silencers modulating transcription efficiency. RNA polymerase II promoters are large and complex, while polymerases I and III have their own distinct conserved elements. During elongation, chromatin structure poses an obstacle that is managed by the FACT complex, which temporarily displaces histones. Termination mechanisms vary: RNA polymerase II continues well past the gene's end before the transcript is cleaved, RNA polymerase I uses specific termination sequences with proteins, and RNA polymerase III employs hairpin structures. The evolution of promoter sequences can influence gene expression levels, and such changes may occur faster than the evolution of protein-coding genes. Overall, eukaryotic transcription ensures precise control over which pre-mRNAs are produced for protein synthesis."

Trypanosomes, and virtually all other eukaryotes, have\norganelles called mitochondria that supply the cell with chemical energy. Mitochondria are organelles that\nexpress their own DNA and are believed to be the remnants of a symbiotic relationship between a eukaryote\nand an engulfed prokaryote. The mitochondrial DNA of trypanosomes exhibit an interesting exception to\nThe Central Dogma: their pre-mRNAs do not have the correct information to specify a functional protein.\nUsually, this is because the mRNA is missing several U nucleotides. The cell performs an additional RNA\nprocessing step called RNA editing to remedy this.\nFigure 15.13 Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of sleeping sickness in humans. The mRNAs of this\npathogen must be modified by the addition of nucleotides before protein synthesis can occur. (credit: modification\nof work by Torsten Ochsenreiter)\nOther genes in the mitochondrial genome encode 40- to 80-nucleotide guide RNAs. One or more of\nthese molecules interacts by complementary base pairing with some of the nucleotides in the pre-mRNA\ntranscript. However, the guide RNA has more A nucleotides than the pre-mRNA has U nucleotides to bind\nwith. In these regions, the guide RNA loops out. The 3' ends of guide RNAs have a long poly-U tail, and\nthese U bases are inserted in regions of the pre-mRNA transcript at which the guide RNAs are looped. This\nprocess is entirely mediated by RNA molecules. That is, guide RNAs\u2014rather than proteins\u2014serve as the\ncatalysts in RNA editing.\nRNA editing is not just a phenomenon of trypanosomes. In the mitochondria of some plants, almost all\npre-mRNAs are edited. RNA editing has also been identified in mammals such as rats, rabbits, and even\nhumans. What could be the evolutionary reason for this additional step in pre-mRNA processing? One\npossibility is that the mitochondria, being remnants of ancient prokaryotes, have an equally ancient RNA-\nbased method for regulating gene expression. In support of this hypothesis, edits made to pre-mRNAs differ\ndepending on cellular conditions. Although speculative, the process of RNA editing may be a holdover from\na primordial time when RNA molecules, instead of proteins, were responsible for catalyzing reactions.\nIn eukaryotes, pre-mRNAs are processed to form mature mRNAs. How does the mRNA editing that occurs in\nTrypanosoma brucei differ from mRNA processing that occurs in all eukaryotes?\na.\nmRNA editing changes the coding sequence of the mRNA, but mRNA processing does not.\nb.\nmRNA editing splices out noncoding RNA, but mRNA processing does not.\nc.\nmRNA editing adds a cap of 5\u2019-methylguanosine to the mRNA, but mRNA processing does not.\nd.\nmRNA editing adds a 3\u2019 poly-A tail, but mRNA processing does not.\nChapter 15 | Genes and Proteins\n611\n5' Capping\nWhile the pre-mRNA is still being synthesized, a 7-methylguanosine cap is added to the 5' end of the growing transcript\nby a phosphate linkage. This moiety (functional group) protects the nascent mRNA from degradation. In addition, factors\ninvolved in protein synthesis recognize the cap to help initiate translation by ribosomes.\n3' Poly-A Tail\nOnce elongation is complete, the pre-mRNA is cleaved by an endonuclease between an AAUAAA consensus sequence and\na GU-rich sequence, leaving the AAUAAA sequence on the pre-mRNA. An enzyme called poly-A polymerase then adds\na string of approximately 200 A residues, called the poly-A tail. This modification further protects the pre-mRNA from\ndegradation and signals the export of the cellular factors that the transcript needs to the cytoplasm.\nPre-mRNA Splicing\nEukaryotic genes are composed of exons, which correspond to protein-coding sequences (ex-on signifies that they are\nexpressed), and intervening sequences called introns (int-ron denotes their intervening role), which may be involved in gene\nregulation but are removed from the pre-mRNA during processing. Intron sequences in mRNA do not encode functional\nproteins.\nThe discovery of introns came as a surprise to researchers in the 1970s who expected that pre-mRNAs would specify protein\nsequences without further processing, as they had observed in prokaryotes. The genes of higher eukaryotes very often\ncontain one or more introns. These regions may correspond to regulatory sequences; however, the biological significance of\nhaving many introns or having very long introns in a gene is unclear. It is possible that introns slow down gene expression\nbecause it takes longer to transcribe pre-mRNAs with lots of introns. Alternatively, introns may be nonfunctional sequence\nremnants left over from the fusion of ancient genes throughout evolution. This is supported by the fact that separate exons\noften encode separate protein subunits or domains. For the most part, the sequences of introns can be mutated without\nultimately affecting the protein product.\nAll of a pre-mRNA\u2019s introns must be completely and precisely removed before protein synthesis. If the process errs by even\na single nucleotide, the reading frame of the rejoined exons would shift, and the resulting protein would be dysfunctional.\nThe process of removing introns and reconnecting exons is called splicing (Figure 15.14). Introns are removed and\ndegraded while the pre-mRNA is still in the nucleus. Splicing occurs by a sequence-specific mechanism that ensures introns\nwill be removed and exons rejoined with the accuracy and precision of a single nucleotide. The splicing of pre-mRNAs is\nconducted by complexes of proteins and RNA molecules called spliceosomes.\n612\nChapter 15 | Genes and Proteins\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 15.14 Pre-mRNA splicing involves the precise removal of introns from the primary RNA transcript. The\nsplicing process is catalyzed by protein complexes called spliceosomes that are composed of proteins and RNA\nmolecules called snRNAs. Spliceosomes recognize sequences at the 5' and 3' end of the intron.\nErrors in splicing are implicated in cancers and other human diseases. What kinds of mutations might lead to splicing\nerrors? Think of different possible outcomes if splicing errors occur.\na.\nMutations in the spliceosome recognition sequence at each end of an intron, or in the proteins and RNAs that\nmake up the spliceosome, may occur. Mutations may also add new spliceosome recognition sites.\nb.\nMutations in the spliceosome recognition sequence at each end of an exon, or in the proteins and RNAs that\nmake up the spliceosome, may occur.

Mutations may also delete existing spliceosome recognition sites.\nd.\nMutations at the each end of intron and exon, or in the proteins and RNAs that make up the spliceosome,\nmay occur. Mutations may also add new spliceosome recognition sites and delete existing sites.\nNote that more than 70 individual introns can be present, and each has to undergo the process of splicing\u2014in addition to 5'\ncapping and the addition of a poly-A tail\u2014just to generate a single, translatable mRNA molecule.\nChapter 15 | Genes and Proteins\n613\nSee how introns are removed during RNA splicing at this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/RNA_splicing) .\nExplain why helper proteins are necessary for the formation of the final protein during RNA splicing in higher\norganisms.\na.\nHelper proteins attach themselves to the ends of introns so that they can be spliced out during RNA splicing\nand coded areas are spliced together to form mRNA which then codes for the final protein.\nb.\nHelper proteins attach themselves to the ends of exons so that they can be spliced out during RNA splicing\nand coded areas are spliced together to form mRNA which encodes the final protein.\nc.\nHelper proteins attach themselves to mRNA in order to remove the non-coded areas and thus form the pre-\nmRNA which codes for the final protein.\nd.\nHelper proteins help the pre-mRNA to recruit various other components which splice out the non-coded\nregions and form mRNA which codes for the final protein.\nProcessing of tRNAs and rRNAs\nThe tRNAs and rRNAs are structural molecules that have roles in protein synthesis; however, these RNAs are not\nthemselves translated. Pre-rRNAs are transcribed, processed, and assembled into ribosomes in the nucleolus. Pre-tRNAs\nare transcribed and processed in the nucleus and then released into the cytoplasm where they are linked to free amino acids\nfor protein synthesis.\nMost of the tRNAs and rRNAs in eukaryotes and prokaryotes are first transcribed as a long precursor molecule that spans\nmultiple rRNAs or tRNAs. Enzymes then cleave the precursors into subunits corresponding to each structural RNA. Some\nof the bases of pre-rRNAs are methylated; that is, a \u2013CH3 moiety (methyl functional group) is added for stability. Pre-\ntRNA molecules also undergo methylation. As with pre-mRNAs, subunit excision occurs in eukaryotic pre-RNAs destined\nto become tRNAs or rRNAs.\nMature rRNAs make up approximately 50 percent of each ribosome. Some of a ribosome\u2019s RNA molecules are purely\nstructural, whereas others have catalytic or binding activities. Mature tRNAs take on a three-dimensional structure through\nintramolecular hydrogen bonding to position the amino acid binding site at one end and the anticodon at the other end\n(Figure 15.15). The anticodon is a three-nucleotide sequence in a tRNA that interacts with an mRNA codon through\ncomplementary base pairing.\n614\nChapter 15 | Genes and Proteins\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 15.15 This is a space-filling model of a tRNA molecule that adds the amino acid phenylalanine to a growing\npolypeptide chain.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 1.16][APLO 4.22][APLO 3.6]\nThe synthesis of proteins consumes more of a cell\u2019s energy than any other metabolic process. In turn, proteins account\nfor more mass than any other component of living organisms (with the exception of water), and proteins perform virtually\nevery function of a cell. The process of translation, or protein synthesis, involves the decoding of an mRNA message into\na polypeptide product. Amino acids are covalently strung together by interlinking peptide bonds in lengths ranging from\napproximately 50 amino acid residues to more than 1,000. Each individual amino acid has an amino group (NH2) and a\ncarboxyl (COOH) group. Polypeptides are formed when the amino group of one amino acid forms an amide (i.e., peptide)\nbond with the carboxyl group of another amino acid (Figure 15.16). This reaction is catalyzed by ribosomes and generates\none water molecule.\nFigure 15.16 A peptide bond links the carboxyl end of one amino acid with the amino end of another, expelling one\nwater molecule. For simplicity in this image, only the functional groups involved in the peptide bond are shown. The R\nand R' designations refer to the rest of each amino acid structure.\nThe Protein Synthesis Machinery\nIn addition to the mRNA template, many molecules and macromolecules contribute to the process of translation. The\ncomposition of each component may vary across species; for instance, ribosomes may consist of different numbers of\nrRNAs and polypeptides depending on the organism. However, the general structures and functions of the protein synthesis\nmachinery are comparable from bacteria to human cells. Translation requires the input of an mRNA template, ribosomes,\ntRNAs, and various enzymatic factors.\n616\nChapter 15 | Genes and Proteins\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nClick through the steps of this PBS interactive (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/prokary_protein) to see protein synthesis\nin action.\nA lack of protein in the diet can cause hair loss. Explain why this occurs.\na.\nDue to lack of protein in the diet, our body will not be able to form other proteins; thus, it will conserve the\nprotein it has for critical use, leading to hair loss.\nb.\nLack of protein in the diet can weaken the immune system, thus leading to hair loss.\nc.\nDue to lack of protein in the diet, energy will be lost, thus leading to hair loss.\nd.\nLack of protein in the diet will lead to breakage of disulfide bonds between proteins, thus leading to hair loss.\nRibosomes\nEven before an mRNA is translated, a cell must invest energy to build each of its ribosomes. In E. coli, there are between\n10,000 and 70,000 ribosomes present in each cell at any given time. A ribosome is a complex macromolecule composed of\nstructural and catalytic rRNAs, and many distinct polypeptides. In eukaryotes, the nucleolus is completely specialized for\nthe synthesis and assembly of rRNAs.\nRibosomes exist in the cytoplasm in prokaryotes and in the cytoplasm and rough endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes.\nMitochondria and chloroplasts also have their own ribosomes in the matrix and stroma, which look more similar to\nprokaryotic ribosomes (and have similar drug sensitivities) than the ribosomes just outside their outer membranes in the\ncytoplasm. Ribosomes dissociate into large and small subunits when they are not synthesizing proteins and reassociate\nduring the initiation of translation. In E. coli, the small subunit is described as 30S, and the large subunit is 50S, for a total of\n70S (recall that Svedberg units are not additive). Mammalian ribosomes have a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit,\nfor a total of 80S. The small subunit is responsible for binding the mRNA template, whereas the large subunit sequentially\nbinds tRNAs. Each mRNA molecule is simultaneously translated by many ribosomes, all synthesizing protein in the same\ndirection: reading the mRNA from 5' to 3' and synthesizing the polypeptide from the N terminus to the C terminus. The\ncomplete mRNA/poly-ribosome structure is called a polysome.\ntRNAs\nThe tRNAs are structural RNA molecules that were transcribed from genes by RNA polymerase III. Depending on the\nspecies, 40 to 60 types of tRNAs exist in the cytoplasm. Serving as adaptors, specific tRNAs bind to sequences on the\nmRNA template and add the corresponding amino acid to the polypeptide chain. Therefore, tRNAs are the molecules that\nactually \u201ctranslate\u201d the language of RNA into the language of proteins.\nOf the 64 possible mRNA codons\u2014or triplet combinations of A, U, G, and C\u2014three specify the termination of protein\nsynthesis and 61 specify the addition of amino acids to the polypeptide chain. Of these 61, one codon (AUG) also encodes\nthe initiation of translation. Each tRNA anticodon can base pair with one of the mRNA codons and add an amino acid or\nterminate translation, according to the genetic code. For instance, if the sequence CUA occurred on an mRNA template in\nthe proper reading frame, it would bind a tRNA expressing the complementary sequence, GAU, which would be linked to\nthe amino acid leucine.\nAs the adaptor molecules of translation, it is surprising that tRNAs can fit so much specificity into such a small package.\nConsider that tRNAs need to interact with three factors: 1) they must be recognized by the correct aminoacyl synthetase\n(see below); 2) they must be recognized by ribosomes; and 3) they must bind to the correct sequence in mRNA.\nAminoacyl tRNA Synthetases\nThe process of pre-tRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase III only creates the RNA portion of the adaptor molecule. The\ncorresponding amino acid must be added later, once the tRNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm. Through\nthe process of tRNA \u201ccharging,\u201d each tRNA molecule is linked to its correct amino acid by a group of enzymes called\nChapter 15 | Genes and Proteins\n617\naminoacyl tRNA synthetases. At least one type of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase exists for each of the 20 amino acids; the\nexact number of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases varies by species. These enzymes first bind and hydrolyze ATP to catalyze a\nhigh-energy bond between an amino acid and adenosine monophosphate (AMP); a pyrophosphate molecule is expelled in\nthis reaction. The activated amino acid is then transferred to the tRNA, and AMP is released.\nThe Mechanism of Protein Synthesis\nAs with mRNA synthesis, protein synthesis can be divided into three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. The\nprocess of translation is similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here we\u2019ll explore how translation occurs in E. coli, a\nrepresentative prokaryote, and specify any differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation.\nInitiation of Translation\nProtein synthesis begins with the formation of an initiation complex. In E. coli, this complex involves the small 30S\nribosome, the mRNA template, three initiation factors (IFs; IF-1, IF-2, and IF-3), and a special initiator tRNA, called\ntRNAf\nMet . The initiator tRNA interacts with the start codon AUG (or rarely, GUG), links to a formylated methionine\ncalled fMet, and can also bind IF-2. Formylated methionine is inserted by fMet \u2212tRNAf\nMet at the beginning of every\npolypeptide chain synthesized by E. coli, but it is usually clipped off after translation is complete. When an in-frame AUG\nis encountered during translation elongation, a non-formylated methionine is inserted by a regular Met-tRNAMet.\nIn E. coli mRNA, a sequence upstream of the first AUG codon, called the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGG), interacts\nwith the rRNA molecules that compose the ribosome. This interaction anchors the 30S ribosomal subunit at the correct\nlocation on the mRNA template. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is a purine nucleotide triphosphate, acts as an energy\nsource during translation\u2014both at the start of elongation and during the ribosome\u2019s translocation.\nIn eukaryotes, a similar initiation complex forms, comprising mRNA, the 40S small ribosomal subunit, IFs, and nucleoside\ntriphosphates (GTP and ATP). The charged initiator tRNA, called Met-tRNAi, does not bind fMet in eukaryotes, but is\ndistinct from other Met-tRNAs in that it can bind IFs.\nInstead of depositing at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the eukaryotic initiation complex recognizes the 7-methylguanosine\ncap at the 5' end of the mRNA. A cap-binding protein (CBP) and several other IFs assist the movement of the ribosome\nto the 5' cap. Once at the cap, the initiation complex tracks along the mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction, searching for the\nAUG start codon. Many eukaryotic mRNAs are translated from the first AUG, but this is not always the case. According\nto Kozak\u2019s rules, the nucleotides around the AUG indicate whether it is the correct start codon. Kozak\u2019s rules state that the\nfollowing consensus sequence must appear around the AUG of vertebrate genes: 5'-gccRccAUGG-3'. The R (for purine)\nindicates a site that can be either A or G, but cannot be C or U. Essentially, the closer the sequence is to this consensus, the\nhigher the efficiency of translation.\nOnce the appropriate AUG is identified, the other proteins and CBP dissociate, and the 60S subunit binds to the complex of\nMet-tRNAi, mRNA, and the 40S subunit. This step completes the initiation of translation in eukaryotes.\nTranslation, Elongation, and Termination\nIn prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the basics of elongation are the same, so we will review elongation from the perspective\nof E. coli. The 50S ribosomal subunit of E. coli consists of three compartments: the A (aminoacyl) site binds incoming\ncharged aminoacyl tRNAs. The P (peptidyl) site binds charged tRNAs carrying amino acids that have formed peptide bonds\nwith the growing polypeptide chain but have not yet dissociated from their corresponding tRNA. The E (exit) site releases\ndissociated tRNAs so that they can be recharged with free amino acids. There is one exception to this assembly line of\ntRNAs: in E. coli, fMet \u2212tRNAf\nMet is capable of entering the P site directly without first entering the A site. Similarly,\nthe eukaryotic Met-tRNAi, with help from other proteins of the initiation complex, binds directly to the P site. In both cases,\nthis creates an initiation complex with a free A site ready to accept the tRNA corresponding to the first codon after the\nAUG.\nDuring translation elongation, the mRNA template provides specificity. As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, each\nmRNA codon comes into register, and specific binding with the corresponding charged tRNA anticodon is ensured. If\nmRNA were not present in the elongation complex, the ribosome would bind tRNAs nonspecifically.\nElongation proceeds with charged tRNAs entering the A site and then shifting to the P site followed by the E site with each\nsingle-codon \u201cstep\u201d of the ribosome. Ribosomal steps are induced by conformational changes that advance the ribosome by\nthree bases in the 3' direction. The energy for each step of the ribosome is donated by an elongation factor that hydrolyzes\nGTP. Peptide bonds form between the amino group of the amino acid attached to the A-site tRNA and the carboxyl group\nof the amino acid attached to the P-site tRNA. The formation of each peptide bond is catalyzed by peptidyl transferase,\nan RNA-based enzyme that is integrated into the 50S ribosomal subunit. The energy for each peptide bond formation is\n618\nChapter 15 | Genes and Proteins\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nderived from GTP hydrolysis, which is catalyzed by a separate elongation factor. The amino acid bound to the P-site tRNA\nis also linked to the growing polypeptide chain. As the ribosome steps across the mRNA, the former P-site tRNA enters the\nE site, detaches from the amino acid, and is expelled (Figure 15.17). Amazingly, the E. coli translation apparatus takes only\n0.05 seconds to add each amino acid, meaning that a 200-amino acid protein can be translated in just 10 seconds.\nChapter 15 | Genes and Proteins\n619\nFigure 15.17 Translation begins when an initiator tRNA anticodon recognizes a codon on mRNA. The large\nribosomal subunit joins the small subunit, and a second tRNA is recruited. As the mRNA moves relative to the\nribosome, the polypeptide chain is formed. Entry of a release factor into the A site terminates translation and the\ncomponents dissociate.\nMany antibiotics inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. For example, tetracycline blocks the A site on the bacterial\nribosome, and chloramphenicol blocks peptidyl transfer.

Chloramphenicol would affect the tRNA\nbinding to the ribosome.\nd.\nTetracycline would directly affect mRNA binding to the ribosome. Chloramphenicol would affect the\nribosome assembly.\nTermination of translation occurs when a nonsense codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is encountered. Upon aligning with\nthe A site, these nonsense codons are recognized by release factors in prokaryotes and eukaryotes that instruct peptidyl\ntransferase to add a water molecule to the carboxyl end of the P-site amino acid. This reaction forces the P-site amino acid\nto detach from its tRNA, and the newly made protein is released. The small and large ribosomal subunits dissociate from the\nmRNA and from each other; they are recruited almost immediately into another translation initiation complex. After many\nribosomes have completed translation, the mRNA is degraded so the nucleotides can be reused in another transcription\nreaction.\nProtein Folding, Modification, and Targeting\nDuring and after translation, individual amino acids may be chemically modified, signal sequences may be appended,\nand the new protein \u201cfolds\u201d into a distinct three-dimensional structure as a result of intramolecular interactions. A signal\nsequence is a short tail of amino acids that directs a protein to a specific cellular compartment. These sequences at the\namino end or the carboxyl end of the protein can be thought of as the protein\u2019s \u201ctrain ticket\u201d to its ultimate destination. Other\ncellular factors recognize each signal sequence and help transport the protein from the cytoplasm to its correct compartment.\nFor instance, a specific sequence at the amino terminus will direct a protein to the mitochondria or chloroplasts (in plants).\nOnce the protein reaches its cellular destination, the signal sequence is usually clipped off.\nMany proteins fold spontaneously, but some proteins require helper molecules, called chaperones, to prevent them from\naggregating during the complicated process of folding. Even if a protein is properly specified by its corresponding mRNA, it\ncould take on a completely dysfunctional shape if abnormal temperature or pH conditions prevent it from folding correctly.\nActivity\n\u2022\nWorking in a small group, create a simple board game to model the key steps of transcription and\ntranslation and have classmates spend ten minutes playing the game.\n\u2022\nProvided with incomplete or incorrect diagrams illustrating transcription and translation in prokaryotes,\nhave students refine or revise the diagrams and share the edited versions with classmates for critical\nreview.\nThink About It\n\u2022\nMany antibiotics inhibit protein synthesis.

        "summary": "Protein synthesis, or translation, is the cellular process of decoding an mRNA sequence into a polypeptide with the help of ribosomes, tRNAs, amino acids, and various enzymes. Ribosomes, made of rRNA and proteins, have small and large subunits that bind mRNA and tRNAs, functioning in the cytoplasm, rough ER, and in mitochondria and chloroplasts; multiple ribosomes can translate an mRNA simultaneously, forming polysomes. tRNAs, each carrying a specific amino acid, match their anticodons to mRNA codons, with aminoacyl tRNA synthetases ensuring correct pairing through \u201ccharging.\u201d Translation proceeds in three stages: initiation (assembly of ribosomal subunits, mRNA, initiator tRNA, and initiation factors at the start codon\u2014via the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in prokaryotes or the 5\u2032 cap/Kozak\u2019s rules in eukaryotes), elongation (sequential addition of amino acids as tRNAs move through the ribosome's A, P, and E sites with peptide bond formation catalyzed by peptidyl transferase), and termination (release of the completed polypeptide upon binding of release factors to a stop codon). Proteins then fold into functional conformations, often with the help of chaperones, and may undergo chemical modifications or receive signal sequences directing them to specific cellular locations."

It promotes cardiovascular health and helps\nto prevent obesity. Scientists have now discovered that long-term endurance training also changes how genes are expressed\nin muscle tissue. In a recent study, 23 healthy people each exercised one leg for 45 minutes four days a week while resting\nthe other leg. After three months, muscles from participants\u2019 legs were biopsied, and scientists analyzed the activity level\nof over 20,000 genes in the tissue samples.\nThey found that for each participant the exercised leg had reduced inflammation and improved metabolism compared\nwith the non-exercised leg. These differences were accompanied by changes in genes associated with metabolism and\ninflammation. However, the actual nucleotide sequences of the genes weren\u2019t changed. Instead, some genes were\nmethylated, which simply means methyl groups were attached to certain nucleotides along the sequence. This, essentially,\nturned the genes \u201coff\u201d or otherwise changed how they were expressed. DNA methylation is an example of epigenetics,\nwhich is a process that alters genes without affecting the nucleotide sequence of the genes. The full research article can be\nfound here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32endurance) .\nChapter 16 | Gene Regulation\n635\n16.1 | Regulation of Gene Expression\nIn this section, you will explore the following question:\n\u2022\nHow does prokaryotic gene regulation differ from eukaryotic gene regulation?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nStructure and function in biology result from the presence of genetic information and the correct expression of this\ninformation. In the chapter on DNA structure and function, we explored how genes are translated into proteins, which in\nturn determine the nature of the cell. But how does a cell know when to \u201cturn on\u201d its DNA? With few exceptions, each cell\nin your body contains identical genetic information. If each cell has the same exact DNA make up, how is it that a liver cell\ndiffers from a nerve or muscle cell?\nAs we will discover, although each cell shares the same genome and DNA sequence, each cell does not express exactly\nthe same genes. Many factors determine when and how genes are expressed in a given cell. Even the type of chromosome\na gene is located on, like whether it is a sex chromosome or not, can determine its expression pattern, as can mutations\nor changes in DNA sequence and other external factors. In prokaryotes, gene expression is regulated primarily at the\nlevel of transcription, when DNA is copied into RNA. However, eukaryotes have evolved regulatory mechanisms in gene\nexpression at multiple levels. In all cases, regulation of gene expression determines the type and amount of protein produced\nin the cell. Errors in regulatory processes can result in many human diseases and conditions, including cancer.\nGene expression regulation occurs at different points in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Prokaryotic organisms express their\nentire genome in every cell, but not necessarily all at the same time. In general, a gene is expressed only when its specific\nprotein product is needed. Remember that each cell in an organism carries the same DNA as every other cell. Yet cells\nof eukaryotic organisms each express a unique subset of DNA depending on cell type. To express a protein, DNA is first\ntranscribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins. In prokaryotic cells, transcription and translation occur almost\nsimultaneously. In eukaryotic cells, transcription occurs in the nucleus, separate from the translation that occurs in the\ncytoplasm along ribosomes attached to endoplasmic reticulum. As stated above, gene expression in prokaryotes is regulated\nat the level of transcription, whereas in eukaryotes, gene expression is regulated at multiple levels, including the epigenetic\n(DNA), transcriptional, pre- and post-transcriptional, and translational levels.\nThe science of epigenetics studies heritable changes in the genome that do not affect the underlying DNA gene sequences.\nThe content presented in this section supports the learning objectives outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum\nFramework. The AP\u00ae learning objectives merge essential knowledge content with one or more of the seven science\npractices. These objectives provide a transparent foundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, along with inquiry-based\nlaboratory experiences, instructional activities, and AP\u00ae exam questions.\nBig Idea 3\nLiving systems store, retrieve, transmit and respond to information essential to life\nprocesses.\nEnduring\nUnderstanding\n3.B\nExpression of genetic information involves cellular and molecular mechanisms.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n3.B.1 Gene regulation results in differential gene expression, leading to cell specialization\nScience\nPractice\n7.1 The student can connect phenomena and models across spatial and temporal scales.\nLearning\nObjective\n3.18 The student is able to describe the connection between the regulation of gene\nexpression and observed differences between different kinds of organisms.\nFor a cell to function properly, necessary proteins must be synthesized at the proper time. All cells control or regulate the\nsynthesis of proteins from information encoded in their DNA. The process of turning on a gene to produce RNA and protein\nis called gene expression. Whether in a simple unicellular organism or a complex multi-cellular organism, each cell controls\n636\nChapter 16 | Gene Regulation\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nwhen and how its genes are expressed. For this to occur, there must be a mechanism to control when a gene is expressed to\nmake RNA and protein, how much of the protein is made, and when it is time to stop making that protein because it is no\nlonger needed.\nAlthough genetic differences between species and between individuals within a species are often responsible for phenotypic\ndifferences, another mechanism that can create phenotypic differences is differences in gene expression. For example,\nalthough every cell in an organism contains the same genes, the bone cells in the organism appears different from the\nfat cells due to differences in which genes are expressed by which cell. Similarly, although mice and humans share\napproximately 97.5% of their genes, they are very different organisms because different genes are turned on at different\ntimes during development and in different cells. Even organisms that share 100% identity in their genomes (a.k.a clones)\ncan eventually appear different if they express their genes differently in response to different environmental conditions, for\nexample. Even among humans, identical twins can possess different birthmarks, wrinkles, or other features that arise during\ndevelopment sometimes due to differential gene expression.\nThe regulation of gene expression conserves energy and space. It would require a significant amount of energy for an\norganism to express every gene at all times, so it is more energy efficient to turn on the genes only when they are required.\nIn addition, only expressing a subset of genes in each cell saves space because DNA must be unwound from its tightly\ncoiled structure to transcribe and translate the DNA. Cells would have to be enormous if every protein were expressed in\nevery cell all the time.\nThe control of gene expression is extremely complex. Malfunctions in this process are detrimental to the cell and can lead\nto the development of many diseases.\nProkaryotic versus Eukaryotic Gene Expression\nTo understand how gene expression is regulated, we must first understand how a gene codes for a functional protein in a\ncell. The process occurs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, just in slightly different manners.\nProkaryotic organisms are single-celled organisms that lack a cell nucleus, and their DNA therefore floats freely in the cell\ncytoplasm. To synthesize a protein, the processes of transcription and translation occur almost simultaneously. When the\nresulting protein is no longer needed, transcription stops. As a result, the primary method to control what type of protein and\nhow much of each protein is expressed in a prokaryotic cell is the regulation of DNA transcription. All of the subsequent\nsteps occur automatically. When more protein is required, more transcription occurs. Therefore, in prokaryotic cells, the\ncontrol of gene expression is mostly at the transcriptional level.\nEukaryotic cells, in contrast, have intracellular organelles that add to their complexity. In eukaryotic cells, the DNA is\ncontained inside the cell\u2019s nucleus and there it is transcribed into RNA. The newly synthesized RNA is then transported\nout of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where ribosomes translate the RNA into protein. The processes of transcription and\ntranslation are physically separated by the nuclear membrane; transcription occurs only within the nucleus, and translation\noccurs only outside the nucleus in the cytoplasm. The regulation of gene expression can occur at all stages of the process\n(Figure 16.2). Regulation may occur when the DNA is uncoiled and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription\nfactors ( epigenetic level), when the RNA is transcribed (transcriptional level), when the RNA is processed and exported\nto the cytoplasm after it is transcribed ( post-transcriptional level), when the RNA is translated into protein (translational\nlevel), or after the protein has been made ( post-translational level).\nChapter 16 | Gene Regulation\n637\nFigure 16.2 Prokaryotic transcription and translation occur simultaneously in the cytoplasm, and regulation occurs at\nthe transcriptional level. Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated during transcription and RNA processing, which take\nplace in the nucleus, and during protein translation, which takes place in the cytoplasm. Further regulation may occur\nthrough post-translational modifications of proteins.\nThe differences in the regulation of gene expression between prokaryotes and eukaryotes are summarized in Table 16.1.\nThe regulation of gene expression is discussed in detail in subsequent modules.\nDifferences in the Regulation of Gene Expression of Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic\nOrganisms\nProkaryotic organisms\nEukaryotic organisms\nLack nucleus\nContain nucleus\nDNA is found in the cytoplasm\nDNA is confined to the nuclear compartment\nRNA transcription and protein\nformation occur almost\nsimultaneously\nRNA transcription occurs prior to protein formation, and it takes place in\nthe nucleus.

Cellular processes such as\ngene silencing developed to protect the cell from viral or parasitic infections.

Simply stated, if a cell does\nnot transcribe the DNA\u2019s message into mRNA, translation (protein synthesis), does not occur. Bacterial genes are often\norganized into common pathways or processes called operons for more coordinated regulation of expression. For example,\nin E. coli, genes responsible for lactose metabolism are located together on the bacterial chromosome. (The operon model\nincludes several components, so when studying how the operon works, it is helpful to refer to a diagram of the model.\nSee Figure 16.3 and Figure 16.4.) The operon includes a regulatory gene that codes for a repressor protein that binds to\nthe operator, which prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the gene(s) of interest. An example of this is seen in the\nstructural genes for lactose metabolism. However, if the repressor is inactivated, RNA polymerase binds to the promoter,\nand transcription of the structural genes occurs.\nThere are three ways to control the transcription of an operon: inducible control, repressible control, and activator control.\nChapter 16 | Gene Regulation\n639\n",
        "summary": "Regulation of gene expression is the process by which cells control the timing, location, and amount of protein production, allowing them to respond to internal and external signals, conserve energy and space, and develop specialized functions despite having the same DNA. While prokaryotic organisms, lacking a nucleus, regulate gene expression primarily at the transcriptional level with transcription and translation occurring simultaneously in the cytoplasm, eukaryotic cells have more complex regulation due to compartmentalization, controlling expression at multiple stages including epigenetic, transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels. Differential gene expression explains variations between cell types within an organism, between different species, and even among genetically identical individuals, and errors in regulation can lead to diseases such as cancer. The complexity of regulation in eukaryotes evolved alongside mechanisms like gene silencing, which can provide survival advantages against threats like viral infections."

For example, all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each\nother in the lactose (or lac) operon.\nIn prokaryotic cells, there are three types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of operons: repressors,\nactivators, and inducers. Repressors are proteins that suppress transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus,\nwhereas activators are proteins that increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus. Finally, inducers\nare small molecules that either activate or repress transcription depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of\nsubstrate.\nThe trp Operon: A Repressor Operon\nBacteria such as E. coli need amino acids to survive. Tryptophan is one such amino acid that E. coli can ingest from the\nenvironment. E. coli can also synthesize tryptophan using enzymes that are encoded by five genes. These five genes are\nnext to each other in what is called the tryptophan (trp) operon (Figure 16.3). If tryptophan is present in the environment,\nthen E. coli does not need to synthesize it and the switch controlling the activation of the genes in the trp operon is switched\noff. However, when tryptophan availability is low, the switch controlling the operon is turned on, transcription is initiated,\nthe genes are expressed, and tryptophan is synthesized.\n640\nChapter 16 | Gene Regulation\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 16.3 The five genes that are needed to synthesize tryptophan in E. coli are located next to each other in the trp\noperon. When tryptophan is plentiful, two tryptophan molecules bind the repressor protein at the operator sequence.\nThis physically blocks the RNA polymerase from transcribing the tryptophan genes. When tryptophan is absent, the\nrepressor protein does not bind to the operator and the genes are transcribed.\nA DNA sequence that codes for proteins is referred to as the coding region. The five coding regions for the tryptophan\nbiosynthesis enzymes are arranged sequentially on the chromosome in the operon. Just before the coding region is the\ntranscriptional start site. This is the region of DNA to which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription. The promoter\nsequence is upstream of the transcriptional start site; each operon has a sequence within or near the promoter to which\nproteins (activators or repressors) can bind and regulate transcription.\nA DNA sequence called the operator sequence is encoded between the promoter region and the first trp coding gene.\nThis operator contains the DNA code to which the repressor protein can bind. When tryptophan is present in the cell,\ntwo tryptophan molecules bind to the trp repressor, which changes shape to bind to the trp operator. Binding of the\ntryptophan\u2013repressor complex at the operator physically prevents the RNA polymerase from binding, and transcribing the\ndownstream genes.\nWhen tryptophan is not present in the cell, the repressor by itself does not bind to the operator; therefore, the operon is\nactive and tryptophan is synthesized. Because the repressor protein actively binds to the operator to keep the genes turned\noff, the trp operon is negatively regulated and the proteins that bind to the operator to silence trp expression are negative\nregulators.\nWatch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/trp_operon) to learn more about the trp operon.\nWhat would happen if bacteria did not have trp R?\na.\nThe cell would not be able to break down tryptophan.\nb.\nThe cell will gradually produce more tryptophan over time.\nc.\nThe cell would not be able to make tryptophan.\nd.\nThe cell would make tryptophan when it was not needed.\nChapter 16 | Gene Regulation\n641\nCatabolite Activator Protein (CAP): An Activator Regulator\nJust as the trp operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules, there are proteins that bind to the operator sequences\nthat act as a positive regulator to turn genes on and activate them. For example, when glucose is scarce, E. coli bacteria\ncan turn to other sugar sources for fuel. To do this, new genes to process these alternate genes must be transcribed. When\nglucose levels drop, cyclic AMP (cAMP) begins to accumulate in the cell. The cAMP molecule is a signaling molecule that\nis involved in glucose and energy metabolism in E. coli. When glucose levels decline in the cell, accumulating cAMP binds\nto the positive regulator catabolite activator protein (CAP), a protein that binds to the promoters of operons that control\nthe processing of alternative sugars. When cAMP binds to CAP, the complex binds to the promoter region of the genes that\nare needed to use the alternate sugar sources (Figure 16.4). In these operons, a CAP binding site is located upstream of the\nRNA polymerase binding site in the promoter. This increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter region\nand the transcription of the genes.\nFigure 16.4 When glucose levels fall, E. coli may use other sugars for fuel but must transcribe new genes to do so. As\nglucose supplies become limited, cAMP levels increase. This cAMP binds to the CAP protein, a positive regulator that\nbinds to an operator region upstream of the genes required to use other sugar sources.\nThe lac Operon: An Inducer Operon\nThe third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through inducible operons, which have proteins that bind to\nactivate or repress transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell. The lac operon is a typical\ninducible operon. As mentioned previously, E. coli is able to use other sugars as energy sources when glucose concentrations\nare low. To do so, the cAMP\u2013CAP protein complex serves as a positive regulator to induce transcription. One such sugar\nsource is lactose. The lac operon encodes the genes necessary to acquire and process the lactose from the local environment.\nCAP binds to the operator sequence upstream of the promoter that initiates transcription of the lac operon. However, for the\nlac operon to be activated, two conditions must be met. First, the level of glucose must be very low or non-existent. Second,\nlactose must be present. Only when glucose is absent and lactose is present will the lac operon be transcribed (Figure 16.5).\nThis makes sense for the cell, because it would be energetically wasteful to create the proteins to process lactose if glucose\nwas plentiful or lactose was not available.\n642\nChapter 16 | Gene Regulation\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 16.5 Transcription of the lac operon is carefully regulated so that its expression only occurs when glucose\nis limited and lactose is present to serve as an alternative fuel source.\nIn E. coli, the trp operon is on by default, while the lac operon is off. Why do you think that this is the case?\na.\nThe trp operon is inducible and is positively regulated. Therefore it is ON by default whereas the lac operon\nis repressible and is OFF by default.\nb.\nThe trp operon synthesizes tryptophan which is essential for the cell and therefore remains ON, whereas the\nlac operon synthesizes enzymes for the breakdown of a sugar that is not always available and remains OFF\nby default.\nc.\nThe trp operon is constitutive and remains ON by default, whereas the lac operon is repressible and therefore\nis OFF by default.\nd.\nThe lac operon undergoes transcriptional attenuation and therefore is OFF by default, whereas the trp operon\nis not regulated by any such mechanism and is ON by default.\nIf glucose is absent, then CAP can bind to the operator sequence to activate transcription. If lactose is absent, then the\nrepressor binds to the operator to prevent transcription. If either of these requirements is met, then transcription remains off.\nChapter 16 | Gene Regulation\n643\nOnly when both conditions are satisfied is the lac operon transcribed (Table 16.2).\nSignals that Induce or Repress Transcription of the lac Operon\nGlucose\nCAP binds\nLactose\nRepressor binds\nTranscription\n+\n-\n-\n+\nNo\n+\n-\n+\n-\nSome\n-\n+\n-\n+\nNo\n-\n+\n+\n-\nYes\nTable 16.2\nWatch an animated tutorial (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/lac_operon) about the workings of lac operon here.\nThe E. coli bacteria can have several mutations that affect the lac operon system. One mutation inhibits the ability of\nRNA polymerase to bind to the lac operon. How would this affect the cell?\na.\nThe cell would make more lactose.\nb.\nThere would be no lactose outside of the cell.\nc.\nThe cell would not be able to process tryptophan.\nd.\nThe cell would not be able to process lactose.\nActivity\nModeling the Operon. Use construction paper or more elaborate materials, such as Styrofoam noodles,\nelectrical tape, and Velcro tabs, to create a model of the lac and trp operons that include a regulator,\npromoter, operator, and structural genes. Then use the model to show how the presence of substrate, e.g.,\nallolactose or tryptophan, can change the activity of the operons. As an extension of the activity, use the\nmodel to make predictions about the effects of mutations in any of the regions on gene expression.\nThink About It\nIn E. coli, the trp operon is on by default, while the lac operon is off by default.

        "summary": "In prokaryotic cells, gene regulation occurs primarily at the transcriptional level, often through the organization of related genes into operons, which allow coordinated expression. Operons consist of structural genes, a promoter where RNA polymerase binds, an operator sequence where regulatory proteins can bind, and often a regulatory gene coding for such proteins. Gene expression is controlled by repressors, activators, and inducers: repressors block transcription, activators enhance it, and inducers can either initiate or inhibit transcription depending on cellular needs. The trp operon is an example of a repressible operon, normally active but turned off when tryptophan is abundant, via a tryptophan\u2013repressor complex that blocks RNA polymerase. The lac operon is an inducible operon that is activated only when glucose is scarce and lactose is present, with its transcription requiring CAP\u2013cAMP binding to the promoter and the absence of a bound repressor. Activator control, as seen with Catabolite Activator Protein, increases RNA polymerase\u2019s binding to the promoter in response to changes in nutrient availability. This system allows prokaryotes to efficiently regulate energy use by producing proteins only when needed."

These signals\nare tags added to histone proteins and DNA that tell the histones if a chromosomal region should be open or closed (Figure\n16.8 depicts modifications to histone proteins and DNA). These tags are not permanent, but may be added or removed as\nneeded. They are chemical modifications (phosphate, methyl, or acetyl groups) that are attached to specific amino acids in\nthe protein or to the nucleotides of the DNA. The tags do not alter the DNA base sequence, but they do alter how tightly\nwound the DNA is around the histone proteins. DNA is a negatively charged molecule; therefore, changes in the charge of\nthe histone will change how tightly wound the DNA molecule will be. When unmodified, the histone proteins have a large\npositive charge; by adding chemical modifications like acetyl groups, the charge becomes less positive.\nThe DNA molecule itself can also be modified. This occurs within very specific regions called CpG islands. These are\nstretches with a high frequency of cytosine and guanine dinucleotide DNA pairs (CG) found in the promoter regions of\ngenes. When this configuration exists, the cytosine member of the pair can be methylated (a methyl group is added). This\nmodification changes how the DNA interacts with proteins, including the histone proteins that control access to the region.\nChapter 16 | Gene Regulation\n647\nHighly methylated (hypermethylated) DNA regions with deacetylated histones are tightly coiled and transcriptionally\ninactive.\nFigure 16.8 Histone proteins and DNA nucleotides can be modified chemically. Modifications affect nucleosome\nspacing and gene expression. (credit: modification of work by NIH)\nThis type of gene regulation is called epigenetic regulation. Epigenetic means \u201caround genetics.\u201d The changes that occur\nto the histone proteins and DNA do not alter the nucleotide sequence and are not permanent. Instead, these changes are\ntemporary (although they often persist through multiple rounds of cell division) and alter the chromosomal structure (open\nor closed) as needed. A gene can be turned on or off depending upon the location and modifications to the histone proteins\nand DNA. If a gene is to be transcribed, the histone proteins and DNA are modified surrounding the chromosomal region\nencoding that gene. This opens the chromosomal region to allow access for RNA polymerase and other proteins, called\ntranscription factors, to bind to the promoter region, located just upstream of the gene, and initiate transcription. If a\ngene is to remain turned off, or silenced, the histone proteins and DNA have different modifications that signal a closed\nchromosomal configuration. In this closed configuration, the RNA polymerase and transcription factors do not have access\nto the DNA and transcription cannot occur (Figure 16.7).\nThink About It\nIn females, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated during embryonic development because of epigenetic changes\nto the chromatin.

In eukaryotic cells, DNA is tightly wound around histone proteins to form nucleosomes, which can block or permit access to transcriptional machinery. Chemical modifications, such as methylation of DNA or histones, typically result in tightly packed nucleosomes and transcriptional silencing, while histone acetylation leads to loosely packed nucleosomes, allowing transcription factors to bind and initiate transcription. These modifications, which occur at specific regions like CpG islands in gene promoters, act as reversible \u201ctags\u201d that influence chromatin structure and determine whether a gene is active or silenced.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 3.18]\nLike prokaryotic cells, the transcription of genes in eukaryotes requires the actions of an RNA polymerase to bind to a\nsequence upstream of a gene to initiate transcription. However, unlike prokaryotic cells, the eukaryotic RNA polymerase\nrequires other proteins, or transcription factors, to facilitate transcription initiation. Transcription factors are proteins\nthat bind to the promoter sequence and other regulatory sequences to control the transcription of the target gene. RNA\npolymerase by itself cannot initiate transcription in eukaryotic cells. Transcription factors must bind to the promoter region\nfirst and recruit RNA polymerase to the site for transcription to be established.\nThe activity of transcription factors can regulate differential gene expression in cells, resulting in the development of\ndifferent cell products and functions. For example, scientists have found that primary sexual characteristics is regulated\nby several genes Figure 16.9. In the fruit fly Drosophila, the slx gene determines sex. This gene is expressed when the\norganism has two copies of the X chromosome. The gene product for slx binds to the mRNA of the tra gene and regulates\nits splicing. In the presence of slx, tra is spliced into its female form and influences the expression of dsx and fru to result in\nfemale sexual characteristics. In the absence of slx, tra is spliced into its male form and male sexual characteristics result.\n650\nChapter 16 | Gene Regulation\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 16.9 In Drosophila melanogaster, the sex is determined by a series of splicing events in sex determination\ngenes on a cell-by-cell basis without any involvement of sex hormones (which circulate throughout the entire\nbody). The primary sex-determination gene is Sex lethal (Sxl), which is transcribed only when the X/A ratio (the X\nchromosome-to-autosome ratio) equals or exceeds 1. As females have two X chromosomes and males have one,\nSxl is transcribed only in females (see the figure, left part). Sxl is a splicing repressor and binds to its target, the\nprimary RNA of the transformer (tra) gene, which undergoes differential splicing depending on the presence (female)\nor absence (male) of Sxl, yielding a protein-coding tra mRNA only in females. The Tra protein binds to the primary\nRNAs of doublesex (dsx) and fruitless (fru). In females, Tra promotes splicing to occur near its binding site, whereas in\nmales it uses an alternative, default splice site. The dsx primary RNA thus produces female-specific mRNA and male-\nspecific mRNA, both of which encode functional Dsx proteins, DsxF and DsxM, respectively. The presence (female)\nand absence (male) of Tra similarly results in female-type fru mRNA and male-type fru mRNA, but here, only the male-\ntype fru mRNA encodes a functional protein.\nView the process of transcription\u2014the making of RNA from a DNA template\u2014at this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/\nl/transcript_RNA) .\nDescribe the major events that occur during eukaryotic transcription.\na.\nDNA unwinds, transcription factors bind, the termination complex forms, and DNA polymerase adds\nnucleotides to the mRNA.\nb.\nDNA unwinds, transcription factors bind, and RNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the mRNA.\nc.\nThe transcription complex forms, transcription factors add nucleotides to the forming mRNA, and the mRNA\ndisconnects from the DNA.\nd.\nElongation occurs, followed by the formation of the transcription initiation complex and the disconnection\nof the mRNA strand from DNA.\nChapter 16 | Gene Regulation\n651\nThe Promoter and the Transcription Machinery\nGenes are organized to make the control of gene expression easier. The promoter region is immediately upstream of the\ncoding sequence. This region can be short (only a few nucleotides in length) or quite long (hundreds of nucleotides long).\nThe longer the promoter, the more available space for proteins to bind. This also adds more control to the transcription\nprocess. The length of the promoter is gene-specific and can differ dramatically between genes. Consequently, the level\nof control of gene expression can also differ quite dramatically between genes. The purpose of the promoter is to bind\ntranscription factors that control the initiation of transcription.\nWithin the promoter region, just upstream of the transcriptional start site, resides the TATA box. This box is simply a\nrepeat of thymine and adenine dinucleotides (literally, TATA repeats). RNA polymerase binds to the transcription initiation\ncomplex, allowing transcription to occur. To initiate transcription, a transcription factor (TFIID) is the first to bind to the\nTATA box. Binding of TFIID recruits other transcription factors, including TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH to the TATA\nbox. Once this complex is assembled, RNA polymerase can bind to its upstream sequence. When bound along with the\ntranscription factors, RNA polymerase is phosphorylated. This releases part of the protein from the DNA to activate the\ntranscription initiation complex and places RNA polymerase in the correct orientation to begin transcription; DNA-bending\nprotein brings the enhancer, which can be quite a distance from the gene, in contact with transcription factors and mediator\nproteins (Figure 16.10).\nFigure 16.10 An enhancer is a DNA sequence that promotes transcription. Each enhancer is made up of short DNA\nsequences called distal control elements. Activators bound to the distal control elements interact with mediator proteins\nand transcription factors. Two different genes may have the same promoter but different distal control elements,\nenabling differential gene expression.\nIn addition to the general transcription factors, other transcription factors can bind to the promoter to regulate gene\ntranscription. These transcription factors bind to the promoters of a specific set of genes. They are not general transcription\nfactors that bind to every promoter complex, but are recruited to a specific sequence on the promoter of a specific gene.\nThere are hundreds of transcription factors in a cell that each bind specifically to a particular DNA sequence motif. When\ntranscription factors bind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene, it is referred to as a cis-acting element, because\nit is on the same chromosome just next to the gene. The region that a particular transcription factor binds to is called the\ntranscription factor binding site. Transcription factors respond to environmental stimuli that cause the proteins to find\ntheir binding sites and initiate transcription of the gene that is needed.\nEnhancers and Transcription\nIn some eukaryotic genes, there are regions that help increase or enhance transcription. These regions, called enhancers,\n652\nChapter 16 | Gene Regulation\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nare not necessarily close to the genes they enhance. They can be located upstream of a gene, within the coding region of the\ngene, downstream of a gene, or may be thousands of nucleotides away.\nEnhancer regions are binding sequences, or sites, for transcription factors. When a DNA-bending protein binds, the shape\nof the DNA changes (Figure 16.10). This shape change allows for the interaction of the activators bound to the enhancers\nwith the transcription factors bound to the promoter region and the RNA polymerase. Whereas DNA is generally depicted\nas a straight line in two dimensions, it is actually a three-dimensional object. Therefore, a nucleotide sequence thousands of\nnucleotides away can fold over and interact with a specific promoter.\nTurning Genes Off: Transcriptional Repressors\nLike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells also have mechanisms to prevent transcription. Transcriptional repressors can bind\nto promoter or enhancer regions and block transcription. Like the transcriptional activators, repressors respond to external\nstimuli to prevent the binding of activating transcription factors.\nThink About It\nHow can cells in a multicellular eukaryotic organism be of different types given that they all share the same genome?\n16.5 | Eukaryotic Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation\nIn this section, you will explore the following question:\n\u2022\nHow is gene expression controlled through post-transcriptional modifications of RNA molecules?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nPost-transcriptional regulation can occur at any stage after transcription.

        "summary": "Eukaryotic transcriptional gene regulation controls gene expression primarily through the actions of transcription factors, enhancers, and repressors. Transcription in eukaryotes begins when general transcription factors bind to the TATA box within the promoter region, recruiting RNA polymerase to form the transcription initiation complex. Promoters vary in length and complexity, influencing the level of regulatory control. Specific transcription factors can bind to cis-acting elements in promoters to regulate particular genes in response to environmental signals, while enhancers\u2014DNA regions potentially located far from the gene\u2014bind activators and, through DNA bending, interact with the promoter to increase transcription. Conversely, transcriptional repressors inhibit transcription by blocking activator binding at promoters or enhancers. These mechanisms allow cells with the same genome to express different sets of genes, enabling cell specialization, as exemplified by sex determination in *Drosophila*, which is governed by regulated splicing events influenced by specific gene products."

This processing after an RNA\nmolecule has been transcribed, but before it is translated into a protein, is called post-transcriptional modification. As with\nthe epigenetic and transcriptional stages of processing, this post-transcriptional step can also be regulated to control gene\nexpression in the cell. If the RNA is not processed, shuttled, or translated, then no protein will be synthesized.\nRNA Splicing, the First Stage of Post-transcriptional Control\nIn eukaryotic cells, the RNA transcript often contains regions, called introns, that are removed prior to translation. The\nregions of RNA that code for protein are called exons (Figure 16.11). After an RNA molecule has been transcribed, but\nprior to its departure from the nucleus to be translated, the RNA is processed and the introns are removed by splicing.\nFigure 16.11 Pre-mRNA can be alternatively spliced to create different proteins.\n654\nChapter 16 | Gene Regulation\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nAlternative RNA Splicing\nIn the 1970s, genes were first observed that exhibited alternative RNA splicing. Alternative RNA splicing is a\nmechanism that allows different protein products to be produced from one gene when different combinations\nof introns, and sometimes exons, are removed from the transcript (Figure 16.12). This alternative splicing\ncan be haphazard, but more often it is controlled and acts as a mechanism of gene regulation, with the\nfrequency of different splicing alternatives controlled by the cell as a way to control the production of\ndifferent protein products in different cells or at different stages of development. Alternative splicing is now\nunderstood to be a common mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes; according to one estimate, 70\npercent of genes in humans are expressed as multiple proteins through alternative splicing.\nFigure 16.12 There are five basic modes of alternative splicing.\nDoes alternative gene splicing increase or decrease the flexibility of gene expression? Explain your answer.\na.\nFlexibility increases because mRNA can be altered after transcription is completed.\nb.\nFlexibility increases because genes can be divided and recombined into new genes.\nc.\nFlexibility decreases because the mRNA molecule becomes smaller.\nd.\nFlexibility decreases because DNA is degraded during alternative splicing.\nChapter 16 | Gene Regulation\n655\nVisualize how mRNA splicing happens by watching the process in action in this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/\nmRNA_splicing) .\nSeveral human diseases are caused by an error in mRNA splicing. Explain why this occurs.\na.\nOnce an mRNA is spliced, the original mRNA cannot be created again.\nb.\nSpliced RNA cannot produce proper proteins.\nc.\nSplicing does not occur at all.\nd.\nSplicing occurs in the wrong location on mRNA.\nThink About It\nWhat is an evolutionary advantage of alternative gene splicing of introns during post-transcriptional modification of\nmRNA?\nControl of RNA Stability\nBefore the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is given two protective \"caps\" that prevent the end of the strand from degrading\nduring its journey. The 5' cap, which is placed on the 5' end of the mRNA, is usually composed of a methylated guanosine\ntriphosphate molecule (GTP). The poly-A tail, which is attached to the 3' end, is usually composed of a series of adenine\nnucleotides. Once the RNA is transported to the cytoplasm, the length of time that the RNA resides there can be controlled.\nEach RNA molecule has a defined lifespan and decays at a specific rate. This rate of decay can influence how much\nprotein is in the cell. If the decay rate is increased, the RNA will not exist in the cytoplasm as long, shortening the time for\ntranslation to occur. Conversely, if the rate of decay is decreased, the RNA molecule will reside in the cytoplasm longer and\nmore protein can be translated. This rate of decay is referred to as the RNA stability. If the RNA is stable, it will be detected\nfor longer periods of time in the cytoplasm.\nBinding of proteins to the RNA can influence its stability. Proteins, called RNA-binding proteins, or RBPs, can bind to\nthe regions of the RNA just upstream or downstream of the protein-coding region. These regions in the RNA that are not\ntranslated into protein are called the untranslated regions, or UTRs. They are not introns (those have been removed in the\nnucleus). Rather, these are regions that regulate mRNA localization, stability, and protein translation. The region just before\nthe protein-coding region is called the 5' UTR, whereas the region after the coding region is called the 3' UTR (Figure\n16.13). The binding of RBPs to these regions can increase or decrease the stability of an RNA molecule, depending on the\nspecific RBP that binds.\n656\nChapter 16 | Gene Regulation\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 16.13 The protein-coding region of mRNA is flanked by 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs).

These microRNAs, or miRNAs, are short RNA molecules that are only 21\u201324 nucleotides in\nlength. The miRNAs are made in the nucleus as longer pre-miRNAs. These pre-miRNAs are chopped into mature miRNAs\nby a protein called dicer. Like transcription factors and RBPs, mature miRNAs recognize a specific sequence and bind to\nthe RNA; however, miRNAs also associate with a ribonucleoprotein complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex\n(RISC). RISC binds along with the miRNA to degrade the target mRNA. Together, miRNAs and the RISC complex rapidly\ndestroy the RNA molecule.\n16.6 | Eukaryotic Translational and Post-translational\nGene Regulation\nIn this section, you will explore the following question:\n\u2022\nWhat are different ways in which translational and post-translational control of gene expression take place?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nChanging the status of the RNA or the protein itself can affect the amount of protein produced, the function of the protein,\nor how long the protein resides in the cell.

As the stability changes, the amount of time that it is available for translation also changes.\nChapter 16 | Gene Regulation\n657\nThe Initiation Complex and Translation Rate\nLike transcription, translation is controlled by proteins that bind and initiate the process. In translation, the complex that\nassembles to start the process is referred to as the initiation complex. The first protein to bind to the RNA to initiate\ntranslation is the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2). The eIF-2 protein is active when it binds to the high-energy\nmolecule guanosine triphosphate (GTP). GTP provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and\nbecoming guanosine diphosphate (GDP). The eIF-2 protein bound to GTP binds to the small 40S ribosomal subunit.\nWhen bound, the methionine initiator tRNA associates with the eIF-2/40S ribosome complex, bringing along with it the\nmRNA to be translated. At this point, when the initiator complex is assembled, the GTP is converted into GDP and energy\nis released. The phosphate and the eIF-2 protein are released from the complex and the large 60S ribosomal subunit binds\nto translate the RNA. The binding of eIF-2 to the RNA is controlled by phosphorylation. If eIF-2 is phosphorylated, it\nundergoes a conformational change and cannot bind to GTP. Therefore, the initiation complex cannot form properly and\ntranslation is impeded (Figure 16.14). When eIF-2 remains unphosphorylated, it binds the RNA and actively translates the\nprotein.\nFigure 16.14 Gene expression can be controlled by factors that bind the translation initiation complex.\nAn increase in phosphorylation levels of eIF-2 has been observed in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as\nAlzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and Huntington\u2019s. What impact do you think this might have on protein synthesis?\na.\nIt will increase the rate of translation.\nb.\nIt will not affect the translation process.\nc.\nIt will block the translation of certain proteins.\nd.\nIt will produce multiple fragments of polypeptides.\nChemical Modifications, Protein Activity, and Longevity\nProteins can be chemically modified with the addition of groups including methyl, phosphate, acetyl, and ubiquitin groups.\nThe addition or removal of these groups from proteins regulates their activity or the length of time they exist in the cell.\nSometimes these modifications can regulate where a protein is found in the cell\u2014for example, in the nucleus, the cytoplasm,\nor attached to the plasma membrane.\nChemical modifications occur in response to external stimuli such as stress, the lack of nutrients, heat, or ultraviolet light\nexposure. These changes can alter epigenetic accessibility, transcription, mRNA stability, or translation\u2014all resulting in\nchanges in expression of various genes. This is an efficient way for the cell to rapidly change the levels of specific proteins\nin response to the environment. Because proteins are involved in every stage of gene regulation, the phosphorylation\nof a protein (depending on the protein that is modified) can alter accessibility to the chromosome, can alter translation\n(by altering transcription factor binding or function), can change nuclear shuttling (by influencing modifications to the\nnuclear pore complex), can alter RNA stability (by binding or not binding to the RNA to regulate its stability), can\nmodify translation (increase or decrease), or can change post-translational modifications (add or remove phosphates or other\nchemical modifications).\n658\nChapter 16 | Gene Regulation\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nThe addition of an ubiquitin group to a protein marks that protein for degradation.

These proteins are moved to the proteasome, an organelle that functions to remove\nproteins, to be degraded (Figure 16.15). One way to control gene expression, therefore, is to alter the longevity of the\nprotein.\nFigure 16.15 Proteins with ubiquitin tags are marked for degradation within the proteasome.\nThink About It\nHow can environmental stimuli such as ultraviolet light exposure or nutrient deficiency modify gene expression?\n16.7 | Cancer and Gene Regulation\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow can changes in gene expression cause cancer?\n\u2022\nHow can changes to gene expression at different levels disrupt the cell cycle?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nCancer is a disease of altered gene expression that can occur at every level of control, including at the levels of DNA\nmethylation, histone acetylation, and activation of transcription factors.

        "summary": "Eukaryotic translational and post-translational gene regulation controls protein production, activity, and lifespan after mRNA enters the cytoplasm. Translation initiation depends on assembly of the initiation complex, beginning with eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2) bound to GTP; phosphorylation of eIF-2 prevents GTP binding, blocking translation. Protein function and stability can be further regulated through chemical modifications such as methylation, phosphorylation, acetylation, or ubiquitination, which can alter protein activity, localization, stability, or interactions. These modifications often occur in response to environmental stimuli like stress, nutrient deprivation, heat, or UV exposure, enabling rapid regulation of gene expression. Ubiquitination specifically targets proteins for degradation in the proteasome, thereby controlling their longevity and influencing cellular protein levels."

In cancer cells, mutations modify cell-cycle control and\ncells don\u2019t stop growing as they normally would. Mutations can also alter the growth rate or the progression of the cell\nthrough the cell cycle. One example of a gene modification that alters the growth rate is increased phosphorylation of cyclin\nB, a protein that controls the progression of a cell through the cell cycle and serves as a cell-cycle checkpoint protein.\nFor cells to move through each phase of the cell cycle, the cell must pass through checkpoints. This ensures that the cell\nhas properly completed the step and has not encountered any mutation that will alter its function. Many proteins, including\ncyclin B, control these checkpoints. The phosphorylation of cyclin B, a post-translational event, alters its function. As a\nresult, cells can progress through the cell cycle unimpeded, even if mutations exist in the cell and its growth should be\nterminated. This post-translational change of cyclin B prevents it from controlling the cell cycle and contributes to the\ndevelopment of cancer.\nCancer: Disease of Altered Gene Expression\nCancer can be described as a disease of altered gene expression. There are many proteins that are turned on or off (gene\nactivation or gene silencing) that dramatically alter the overall activity of the cell. A gene that is not normally expressed\nin that cell can be switched on and expressed at high levels. This can be the result of gene mutation or changes in gene\nregulation (epigenetic, transcription, post-transcription, translation, or post-translation).\nChanges in epigenetic regulation, transcription, RNA stability, protein translation, and post-translational control can be\ndetected in cancer. While these changes don\u2019t occur simultaneously in one cancer, changes at each of these levels can\nbe detected when observing cancer at different sites in different individuals. Therefore, changes in histone acetylation\n(epigenetic modification that leads to gene silencing), activation of transcription factors by phosphorylation, increased RNA\nstability, increased translational control, and protein modification can all be detected at some point in various cancer cells.\nScientists are working to understand the common changes that give rise to certain types of cancer or how a modification\nmight be exploited to destroy a tumor cell.\nTumor Suppressor Genes, Oncogenes, and Cancer\nIn normal cells, some genes function to prevent excess, inappropriate cell growth. These are tumor suppressor genes, which\nare active in normal cells to prevent uncontrolled cell growth. There are many tumor suppressor genes in cells. The most\nstudied tumor suppressor gene is p53, which is mutated in over 50 percent of all cancer types. The p53 protein itself\nfunctions as a transcription factor. It can bind to sites in the promoters of genes to initiate transcription. Therefore, the\nmutation of p53 in cancer will dramatically alter the transcriptional activity of its target genes.\n660\nChapter 16 | Gene Regulation\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nWatch this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/p53_cancer) to learn more about the use of p53 in fighting cancer.\nTreatment of cancer is often called a \u201cfight against biology.\u201d Explain why the use of p53 supports this statement.\na.\nbecause normal cells are often negatively affected by cancer treatments, including p53\nb.\nbecause cancer cells are always affected by current cancer treatments, including p53\nc.\nbecause normal cells are often negatively affected by cancer treatments, with the exception of p53\nd.\nbecause cancer cells often aren\u2019t affected by cancer treatments, with the exception of p53\nProto-oncogenes are positive cell-cycle regulators. When mutated, proto-oncogenes can become oncogenes and cause\ncancer. Overexpression of the oncogene can lead to uncontrolled cell growth. This is because oncogenes can alter\ntranscriptional activity, stability, or protein translation of another gene that directly or indirectly controls cell growth. An\nexample of an oncogene involved in cancer is a protein called myc. Myc is a transcription factor that is aberrantly activated\nin Burkett\u2019s Lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system. Overexpression of myc transforms normal B cells into cancerous\ncells that continue to grow uncontrollably. High B-cell numbers can result in tumors that can interfere with normal bodily\nfunction. Patients with Burkett\u2019s lymphoma can develop tumors on their jaw or in their mouth that interfere with the ability\nto eat.\nCancer and Epigenetic Alterations\nSilencing genes through epigenetic mechanisms is also very common in cancer cells. There are characteristic modifications\nto histone proteins and DNA that are associated with silenced genes. In cancer cells, the DNA in the promoter region\nof silenced genes is methylated on cytosine DNA residues in CpG islands. Histone proteins that surround that region\nlack the acetylation modification that is present when the genes are expressed in normal cells. This combination of DNA\nmethylation and histone deacetylation (epigenetic modifications that lead to gene silencing) is commonly found in cancer.\nWhen these modifications occur, the gene present in that chromosomal region is silenced. Increasingly, scientists understand\nhow epigenetic changes are altered in cancer. Because these changes are temporary and can be reversed\u2014for example, by\npreventing the action of the histone deacetylase protein that removes acetyl groups, or by DNA methyl transferase enzymes\nthat add methyl groups to cytosines in DNA\u2014it is possible to design new drugs and new therapies to take advantage of the\nreversible nature of these processes. Indeed, many researchers are testing how a silenced gene can be switched back on in a\ncancer cell to help re-establish normal growth patterns.\nGenes involved in the development of many other illnesses, ranging from allergies to inflammation to autism, are thought to\nbe regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. As our knowledge of how genes are controlled deepens, new ways to treat diseases\nlike cancer will emerge.\nCancer and Transcriptional Control\nAlterations in cells that give rise to cancer can affect the transcriptional control of gene expression. Mutations that activate\ntranscription factors, such as increased phosphorylation, can increase the binding of a transcription factor to its binding\nsite in a promoter. This could lead to increased transcriptional activation of that gene that results in modified cell growth.\nAlternatively, a mutation in the DNA of a promoter or enhancer region can increase the binding ability of a transcription\nfactor. This could also lead to the increased transcription and aberrant gene expression that is seen in cancer cells.\nResearchers have been investigating how to control the transcriptional activation of gene expression in cancer. Identifying\nhow a transcription factor binds, or a pathway that activates where a gene can be turned off, has led to new drugs and\nnew ways to treat cancer. In breast cancer, for example, many proteins are overexpressed. This can lead to increased\nphosphorylation of key transcription factors that increase transcription. One such example is the overexpression of the\nepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in a subset of breast cancers. The EGFR pathway activates many protein kinases\nthat, in turn, activate many transcription factors that control genes involved in cell growth. New drugs that prevent the\nChapter 16 | Gene Regulation\n661\nactivation of EGFR have been developed and are used to treat these cancers.\nCancer and Post-transcriptional Control\nChanges in the post-transcriptional control of a gene can also result in cancer. Recently, several groups of researchers have\nshown that specific cancers have altered expression of miRNAs. Because miRNAs bind to the 3' UTR of RNA molecules to\ndegrade them, overexpression of these miRNAs could be detrimental to normal cellular activity. Too many miRNAs could\ndramatically decrease the RNA population leading to a decrease in protein expression. Several studies have demonstrated a\nchange in the miRNA population in specific cancer types. It appears that the subset of miRNAs expressed in breast cancer\ncells is quite different from the subset expressed in lung cancer cells or even from normal breast cells. This suggests that\nalterations in miRNA activity can contribute to the growth of breast cancer cells. These types of studies also suggest that if\nsome miRNAs are specifically expressed only in cancer cells, they could be potential drug targets. It would, therefore, be\nconceivable that new drugs that turn off miRNA expression in cancer could be an effective method to treat cancer.\nCancer and Translational/Post-translational Control\nThere are many examples of how translational or post-translational modifications of proteins arise in cancer. Modifications\nare found in cancer cells from the increased translation of a protein to changes in protein phosphorylation to alternative\nsplice variants of a protein. An example of how the expression of an alternative form of a protein can have dramatically\ndifferent outcomes is seen in colon cancer cells. The c-Flip protein, a protein involved in mediating the cell death pathway,\ncomes in two forms: long (c-FLIPL) and short (c-FLIPS). Both forms appear to be involved in initiating controlled cell\ndeath mechanisms in normal cells. However, in colon cancer cells, expression of the long form results in increased cell\ngrowth instead of cell death. Clearly, the expression of the wrong protein dramatically alters cell function and contributes to\nthe development of cancer.\nNew Drugs to Combat Cancer: Targeted Therapies\nScientists are using what is known about the regulation of gene expression in disease states, including cancer, to develop\nnew ways to treat and prevent disease development. Many scientists are designing drugs on the basis of the gene expression\npatterns within individual tumors. This idea, that therapy and medicines can be tailored to an individual, has given rise to\nthe field of personalized medicine. With an increased understanding of gene regulation and gene function, medicines can be\ndesigned to specifically target diseased cells without harming healthy cells. Some new medicines, called targeted therapies,\nhave exploited the overexpression of a specific protein or the mutation of a gene to develop a new medication to treat\ndisease. One such example is the use of anti-EGF receptor medications to treat the subset of breast cancer tumors that have\nvery high levels of the EGF protein. Undoubtedly, more targeted therapies will be developed as scientists learn more about\nhow gene expression changes can cause cancer.\nClinical Trial Coordinator\nA clinical trial coordinator is the person managing the proceedings of the clinical trial. This job includes\ncoordinating patient schedules and appointments, maintaining detailed notes, building the database to track\npatients (especially for long-term follow-up studies), ensuring proper documentation has been acquired and\naccepted, and working with the nurses and doctors to facilitate the trial and publication of the results. A\nclinical trial coordinator may have a science background, like a nursing degree, or other certification. People\nwho have worked in science labs or in clinical offices are also qualified to become a clinical trial coordinator.\nThese jobs are generally in hospitals; however, some clinics and doctor\u2019s offices also conduct clinical trials\nand may hire a coordinator.\n662\nChapter 16 | Gene Regulation\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nThink About It\nNew drugs are being developed that decrease DNA methylation and prevent the removal of acetyl groups from histone\nproteins.

        "summary": "Cancer is a disease of altered gene expression that can occur at multiple regulatory levels, including epigenetic changes, transcription, RNA stability, translation, and post-translation, disrupting normal cell-cycle control and enabling uncontrolled growth. Mutations in tumor suppressor genes, such as p53, can eliminate growth inhibition, while mutations in proto-oncogenes can create oncogenes, like myc, that drive excessive proliferation. Epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, can silence genes, but these changes are reversible and present therapeutic opportunities. Transcriptional dysregulation may involve mutations enhancing transcription factor activation (e.g., EGFR signaling in breast cancer), and post-transcriptional changes, such as abnormal miRNA expression, can alter RNA stability and protein production in a cancer-specific manner. Translational and post-translational modifications, including altered phosphorylation or alternative protein forms (e.g., c-FLIP in colon cancer), can further promote malignancy. Advances in understanding gene regulation in cancer have led to targeted therapies and personalized medicine strategies that exploit specific gene expression patterns to selectively attack tumor cells."

For example,\nintestinal failure due to missing or abnormal intestinal tissue is a frequent problem in premature babies. Intestinal problems\nare also common for people who have had parts of their small intestines removed for reasons , such as Crohn\u2019s Disease,\ncancer, and blockages. Complications from intestinal failure may include liver disease, bacterial overgrowth, dehydration,\nand malnutrition.\nScientists have recently developed a way to engineer human intestines from human cells using mice. Using a mixture of\nhealthy mouse and human intestinal cells and placing it on scaffolding in the abdominal cavity of immunocompromised\nmice, functional human intestinal cells grow within four weeks. This could be the breakthrough needed to help patients\nsuffering from intestinal failure. More details about this exciting research can be found here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/\n32grwinmouse) .\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\n677\n17.1 | Biotechnology\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are examples of basic techniques used to manipulate genetic material (DNA and RNA)?\n\u2022\nWhat is the difference between molecular and reproductive cloning?\n\u2022\nWhat are examples of uses of biotechnology in medicine and agriculture?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nDid you eat cereal for breakfast or tomatoes in your dinner salad? Do you know someone who has received gene therapy\nto treat a disease such as cancer? Should your school, health insurance provider, or employer have access to your genetic\nprofile? Understanding how DNA works has allowed scientists to recombine DNA molecules, clone organisms, and produce\nmice that glow in the dark. We likely have eaten genetically modified foods and are familiar with how DNA analysis is\nused to solve crimes. Manipulation of DNA by humans has resulted in bacteria that can protect plants from insect pests\nand restore ecosystems. Biotechnologies also have been used to produce insulin, hormones, antibiotics, and medicine that\ndissolve blood clots. Comparative genomics yields new insights into relationships among species, and DNA sequences\nreveal our personal genetic make-up. However, manipulation of DNA comes with social and ethical responsibilities, raising\nquestions about its appropriate uses.\nNucleic acids can be isolated from cells for analysis by lysing cell membranes and enzymatically destroying all other\nmacromolecules. Fragmented or whole chromosomes can be separated on the basis of size (base pair length) by gel\nelectrophoresis. Short sequences of DNA or RNA can be amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\nRecombinant DNA technology can combine DNA from different sources using bacterial plasmids or viruses as vectors to\ncarry foreign genes into host cells, resulting in genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Transgenic bacteria, agricultural\nplants such as corn and rice, and farm animals produce protein products such as hormones and vaccines that benefit humans.\n(It is important to remind ourselves that recombinant technology is possible because the genetic code is universal, and\nthe processes of transcription and translation are fundamentally the same in all organisms.) Cloning produces genetically\nidentical copies of DNA, cells, or even entire organisms (reproductive cloning). Genetic testing identifies disease-causing\ngenes, and gene therapy can be used to treat or cure an inheritable disease. However, questions emerge from these\ntechnologies including the safety of GMOs and privacy issues.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 3.13][APLO 3.23][APLO 3.28][APLO 3.24][APLO 1.11][APLO 3.5][APLO 4.2][APLO 4.8]\nBiotechnology is the use of biological agents for technological advancement. Biotechnology was used for breeding\nlivestock and crops long before the scientific basis of these techniques was understood. Since the discovery of the structure\nof DNA in 1953, the field of biotechnology has grown rapidly through both academic research and private companies.\nThe primary applications of this technology are in medicine (production of vaccines and antibiotics) and agriculture\n(genetic modification of crops, such as to increase yields). Biotechnology also has many industrial applications, such as\nfermentation, the treatment of oil spills, and the production of biofuels.\nBasic Techniques to Manipulate Genetic Material (DNA and RNA)\nTo understand the basic techniques used to work with nucleic acids, remember that nucleic acids are macromolecules made\nof nucleotides (a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base) linked by phosphodiester bonds. The phosphate groups on\nthese molecules each have a net negative charge. An entire set of DNA molecules in the nucleus is called the genome.\nDNA has two complementary strands linked by hydrogen bonds between the paired bases. The two strands can be separated\nby exposure to high temperatures (DNA denaturation) and can be reannealed by cooling. The DNA can be replicated by\nthe DNA polymerase enzyme. Unlike DNA, which is located in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, RNA molecules leave the\nnucleus. The most common type of RNA that is analyzed is the messenger RNA (mRNA) because it represents the protein-\ncoding genes that are actively expressed. However, RNA molecules present some other challenges to analysis, as they are\noften less stable than DNA.\nDNA and RNA Extraction\nTo study or manipulate nucleic acids, the DNA or RNA must first be isolated or extracted from the cells. Various techniques\nare used to extract different types of DNA (Figure 17.2). Most nucleic acid extraction techniques involve steps to break\nopen the cell and use enzymatic reactions to destroy all macromolecules that are not desired (such as degradation of\nunwanted molecules and separation from the DNA sample). Cells are broken using a lysis buffer (a solution which is\nmostly a detergent); lysis means \u201cto split.\u201d These enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear\nmembranes. Macromolecules are inactivated using enzymes such as proteases that break down proteins, and ribonucleases\n(RNAses) that break down RNA. The DNA is then precipitated using alcohol. Human genomic DNA is usually visible as a\ngelatinous, white mass. The DNA samples can be stored frozen at \u201380\u00b0C for several years.\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\n679\nFigure 17.2 This diagram shows the basic method used for extraction of DNA.\nRNA analysis is performed to study gene expression patterns in cells. RNA is naturally very unstable because RNAses are\ncommonly present in nature and very difficult to inactivate. Similar to DNA, RNA extraction involves the use of various\nbuffers and enzymes to inactivate macromolecules and preserve the RNA.\nGel Electrophoresis\nBecause nucleic acids are negatively charged ions at neutral or basic pH in an aqueous environment, they can be mobilized\nby an electric field. Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate molecules on the basis of size, using this charge.\nThe nucleic acids can be separated as whole chromosomes or fragments. The nucleic acids are loaded into a slot near the\nnegative electrode of a semisolid, porous gel matrix and pulled toward the positive electrode at the opposite end of the gel.\nSmaller molecules move through the pores in the gel faster than larger molecules; this difference in the rate of migration\nseparates the fragments on the basis of size. There are molecular weight standard samples that can be run alongside the\nmolecules to provide a size comparison. Nucleic acids in a gel matrix can be observed using various fluorescent or colored\ndyes. Distinct nucleic acid fragments appear as bands at specific distances from the top of the gel (the negative electrode\nend) on the basis of their size (Figure 17.3). A mixture of genomic DNA fragments of varying sizes appear as a long smear,\nwhereas uncut genomic DNA is usually too large to run through the gel and forms a single large band at the top of the gel.\n680\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 17.3 Shown are DNA fragments from seven samples run on a gel, stained with a fluorescent dye, and viewed\nunder UV light. (credit: James Jacob, Tompkins Cortland Community College)\nAmplification of Nucleic Acid Fragments by Polymerase Chain Reaction\nAlthough genomic DNA is visible to the naked eye when it is extracted in bulk, DNA analysis often requires focusing on\none or more specific regions of the genome. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique used to amplify specific\nregions of DNA for further analysis (Figure 17.4). PCR is used for many purposes in laboratories, such as the cloning of\ngene fragments to analyze genetic diseases, identification of contaminant foreign DNA in a sample, and the amplification\nof DNA for sequencing. More practical applications include the detection of genetic diseases.\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\n681\nFigure 17.4 Polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, is used to amplify a specific sequence of DNA. Primers\u2014short pieces\nof DNA complementary to each end of the target sequence\u2014are combined with genomic DNA, Taq polymerase, and\ndeoxynucleotides. Taq polymerase is a DNA polymerase isolated from the thermostable bacterium Thermus aquaticus\nthat is able to withstand the high temperatures used in PCR. Thermus aquaticus grows in the Lower Geyser Basin of\nYellowstone National Park. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is similar to PCR, but cDNA is made from an RNA\ntemplate before PCR begins.\nDNA fragments can also be amplified from an RNA template in a process called reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR).\nThe first step is to recreate the original DNA template strand (called cDNA) by applying DNA nucleotides to the mRNA.\nThis process is called reverse transcription. This requires the presence of an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. After the\ncDNA is made, regular PCR can be used to amplify it.\n682\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nDeepen your understanding of the polymerase chain reaction by clicking through this interactive exercise\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/PCR) .\nExplain an advantage the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has for DNA research.\na.\nThe process of PCR can isolate a particular piece of DNA for copying, which allows scientists to copy\nmillions of strands of DNA in a short amount of time.\nb.\nThe process of PCR can purify a particular piece of DNA, and very small amounts of DNA can be used for\npurification.\nc.\nThe process of PCR separates and analyzes DNA and its fragments, which requires very little DNA.\nd.\nThe process of PCR anneals DNA molecules to complementary DNA strands, which maintains the same\namount of DNA.\nHybridization, Southern Blotting, and Northern Blotting\nNucleic acid samples, such as fragmented genomic DNA and RNA extracts, can be probed for the presence of certain\nsequences. Short DNA fragments called probes are designed and labeled with radioactive or fluorescent dyes to aid\ndetection. Gel electrophoresis separates the nucleic acid fragments according to their size. The fragments in the gel are then\ntransferred onto a nylon membrane in a procedure called blotting (Figure 17.5). The nucleic acid fragments that are bound\nto the surface of the membrane can then be probed with specific radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe sequences.\nWhen DNA is transferred to a nylon membrane, the technique is called Southern blotting, and when RNA is transferred to\na nylon membrane, it is called northern blotting. Southern blots are used to detect the presence of certain DNA sequences\nin a given genome, and northern blots are used to detect gene expression.\nFigure 17.5 Southern blotting is used to find a particular sequence in a sample of DNA. DNA fragments are separated\non a gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and incubated with a DNA probe complementary to the sequence of\ninterest. Northern blotting is similar to Southern blotting, but RNA is run on the gel instead of DNA. In western blotting,\nproteins are run on a gel and detected using antibodies.\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\n683\nMolecular Cloning\nIn general, the word \u201ccloning\u201d means the creation of a perfect replica; however, in biology, the re-creation of a whole\norganism is referred to as \u201creproductive cloning.\u201d Long before attempts were made to clone an entire organism, researchers\nlearned how to reproduce desired regions or fragments of the genome, a process that is referred to as molecular cloning.\nCloning small fragments of the genome allows for the manipulation and study of specific genes (and their protein products),\nor noncoding regions in isolation. A plasmid (also called a vector) is a small circular DNA molecule that replicates\nindependently of the chromosomal DNA. In cloning, the plasmid molecules can be used to provide a \"folder\" in which\nto insert a desired DNA fragment. Plasmids are usually introduced into a bacterial host for proliferation. In the bacterial\ncontext, the fragment of DNA from the human genome (or the genome of another organism that is being studied) is referred\nto as foreign DNA, or a transgene, to differentiate it from the DNA of the bacterium, which is called the host DNA.\nPlasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations (such as Escherichia coli) and have genes that can contribute favorable\ntraits to the organism, such as antibiotic resistance (the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics). Plasmids have been\nrepurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large-scale production of important reagents, such as\ninsulin and human growth hormone. An important feature of plasmid vectors is the ease with which a foreign DNA fragment\ncan be introduced via the multiple cloning site (MCS). The MCS is a short DNA sequence containing multiple sites\nthat can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases. Restriction endonucleases recognize specific\nDNA sequences and cut them in a predictable manner; they are naturally produced by bacteria as a defense mechanism\nagainst foreign DNA. Many restriction endonucleases make staggered cuts in the two strands of DNA, such that the cut\nends have a 2- or 4-base single-stranded overhang. Because these overhangs are capable of annealing with complementary\noverhangs, these are called \u201csticky ends.\u201d Addition of an enzyme called DNA ligase permanently joins the DNA fragments\nvia phosphodiester bonds. In this way, any DNA fragment generated by restriction endonuclease cleavage can be spliced\nbetween the two ends of a plasmid DNA that has been cut with the same restriction endonuclease (Figure 17.6).\nRecombinant DNA Molecules\nPlasmids with foreign DNA inserted into them are called recombinant DNA molecules because they are created artificially\nand do not occur in nature. They are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of different parts of the molecules can\nbe traced back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis. Proteins that are expressed from\nrecombinant DNA molecules are called recombinant proteins. Not all recombinant plasmids are capable of expressing\ngenes. The recombinant DNA may need to be moved into a different vector (or host) that is better designed for gene\nexpression. Plasmids may also be engineered to express proteins only when stimulated by certain environmental factors, so\nthat scientists can control the expression of the recombinant proteins.\n684\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 17.6 This diagram shows the steps involved in molecular cloning.\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\n685\nYou are working in a molecular biology lab and, unbeknownst to you, your lab partner left the foreign genomic DNA\nyou are planning to clone on the lab bench overnight instead of storing it in the freezer.

However, cloning also produces crop plants that have little genetic\nvariation. In a group, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using clones as human food sources in\nan era where the Earth is undergoing a period of climate change. How well will cloned populations of crop\nplants be able to adapt to climate change, compared to non-clone crop plants? Then, defend your group\u2019s\nposition against those of other groups in a classroom debate.\nThink About It\nHow would a scientist introduce a gene for herbicide resistance into a plant, such as corn?\nCellular Cloning\nUnicellular organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, naturally produce clones of themselves when they replicate asexually by\nbinary fission; this is known as cellular cloning. The nuclear DNA duplicates by the process of mitosis, which creates an\nexact replica of the genetic material.\nReproductive Cloning\nReproductive cloning is a method used to make a clone or an identical copy of an entire multicellular organism. Most\nmulticellular organisms undergo reproduction by sexual means, which involves genetic hybridization of two individuals\n(parents), making it impossible for generation of an identical copy or a clone of either parent. Recent advances in\nbiotechnology have made it possible to artificially induce asexual reproduction of mammals in the laboratory.\nParthenogenesis, or \u201cvirgin birth,\u201d occurs when an embryo grows and develops without the fertilization of the egg\noccurring; this is a form of asexual reproduction. An example of parthenogenesis occurs in species in which the female lays\nan egg and if the egg is fertilized, it is a diploid egg and the individual develops into a female; if the egg is not fertilized, it\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\n687\nremains a haploid egg and develops into a male. The unfertilized egg is called a parthenogenic, or virgin, egg. Some insects\nand reptiles lay parthenogenic eggs that can develop into adults.\nSexual reproduction requires two cells; when the haploid egg and sperm cells fuse, a diploid zygote results. The zygote\nnucleus contains the genetic information to produce a new individual. However, early embryonic development requires the\ncytoplasmic material contained in the egg cell. This idea forms the basis for reproductive cloning. Therefore, if the haploid\nnucleus of an egg cell is replaced with a diploid nucleus from the cell of any individual of the same species (called a donor),\nit will become a zygote that is genetically identical to the donor. Somatic cell nuclear transfer is the technique of transferring\na diploid nucleus into an enucleated egg. It can be used for either therapeutic cloning or reproductive cloning.\nThe first cloned animal was Dolly, a sheep who was born in 1996. The success rate of reproductive cloning at the time was\nvery low. Dolly lived for seven years and died of respiratory complications (Figure 17.7). There is speculation that because\nthe cell DNA belongs to an older individual, the age of the DNA may affect the life expectancy of a cloned individual.\nSince Dolly, several animals such as horses, bulls, and goats have been successfully cloned, although these individuals often\nexhibit facial, limb, and cardiac abnormalities. There have been attempts at producing cloned human embryos as sources of\nembryonic stem cells, sometimes referred to as cloning for therapeutic purposes. Therapeutic cloning produces stem cells\nto attempt to remedy detrimental diseases or defects (unlike reproductive cloning, which aims to reproduce an organism).\nStill, therapeutic cloning efforts have met with resistance because of bioethical considerations.\n688\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 17.7 Dolly the sheep was the first mammal to be cloned. To create Dolly, the nucleus was removed\nfrom a donor egg cell. The nucleus from a second sheep was then introduced into the cell, which was allowed\nto divide to the blastocyst stage before being implanted in a surrogate mother. (credit: modification of work by\n\"Squidonius\"/Wikimedia Commons)\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\n689\nDo you think Dolly was a Finn-Dorset or a Scottish Blackface sheep?\na.\nBlackface because this follows cytoplasmic inheritance.\nb.\nDolly was a Finn-Dorset sheep; the nucleus in the process was taken from a Finn-Dorset mother.\nc.\nDorset sheep because this follows cytoplasmic inheritance.\nd.\nDolly the sheep was a Scottish blackface due to epigenetic inheritance.\nGenetic Engineering\nGenetic engineering is the alteration of an organism\u2019s genotype using recombinant DNA technology to modify an\norganism\u2019s DNA to achieve desirable traits. The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors\ngenerated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering. The organism that receives the\nrecombinant DNA is called a genetically modified organism (GMO). If the foreign DNA that is introduced comes from a\ndifferent species, the host organism is called transgenic. Bacteria, plants, and animals have been genetically modified since\nthe early 1970s for academic, medical, agricultural, and industrial purposes. In the US, GMOs such as herbicide-resistant\nsoybeans and borer-resistant corn are part of many common processed foods.\nGene Targeting\nAlthough classical methods of studying the function of genes began with a given phenotype and determined the genetic\nbasis of that phenotype, modern techniques allow researchers to start at the DNA sequence level and ask: \"What does\nthis gene or DNA element do?\" This technique, called reverse genetics, has resulted in reversing the classic genetic\n690\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nmethodology. This method would be similar to damaging a body part to determine its function. An insect that loses a wing\ncannot fly, which means that the function of the wing is flight. The classical genetic method would compare insects that\ncannot fly with insects that can fly, and observe that the non-flying insects have lost wings. Similarly, mutating or deleting\ngenes provides researchers with clues about gene function. The methods used to disable gene function are collectively called\ngene targeting. Gene targeting is the use of recombinant DNA vectors to alter the expression of a particular gene, either\nby introducing mutations in a gene, or by eliminating the expression of a certain gene by deleting a part or all of the gene\nsequence from the genome of an organism.\nBiotechnology in Medicine and Agriculture\nIt is easy to see how biotechnology can be used for medicinal purposes. Knowledge of the genetic makeup of our species,\nthe genetic basis of heritable diseases, and the invention of technology to manipulate and fix mutant genes provides methods\nto treat the disease. Biotechnology in agriculture can enhance resistance to disease, pest, and environmental stress, and\nimprove both crop yield and quality.\nGenetic Diagnosis and Gene Therapy\nThe process of testing for suspected genetic defects before administering treatment is called genetic diagnosis by genetic\ntesting. Depending on the inheritance patterns of a disease-causing gene, family members are advised to undergo genetic\ntesting. For example, women diagnosed with breast cancer are usually advised to have a biopsy so that the medical team can\ndetermine the genetic basis of cancer development. Treatment plans are based on the findings of genetic tests that determine\nthe type of cancer. If the cancer is caused by inherited gene mutations, other female relatives are also advised to undergo\ngenetic testing and periodic screening for breast cancer. Genetic testing is also offered for fetuses (or embryos with in vitro\nfertilization) to determine the presence or absence of disease-causing genes in families with specific debilitating diseases.\nGene therapy is a genetic engineering technique used to cure disease. In its simplest form, it involves the introduction of a\ngood gene at a random location in the genome to aid the cure of a disease that is caused by a mutated gene. The good gene\nis usually introduced into diseased cells as part of a vector transmitted by a virus that can infect the host cell and deliver\nthe foreign DNA (Figure 17.8). More advanced forms of gene therapy try to correct the mutation at the original site in the\ngenome, such as is the case with treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).\nFigure 17.8 Gene therapy using an adenovirus vector can be used to cure certain genetic diseases in which a person\nhas a defective gene. (credit: NIH)\nProduction of Vaccines, Antibiotics, and Hormones\nTraditional vaccination strategies use weakened or inactive forms of microorganisms to mount the initial immune response.\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\n691\nModern techniques use the genes of microorganisms cloned into vectors to mass produce the desired antigen. The antigen\nis then introduced into the body to stimulate the primary immune response and trigger immune memory. Genes cloned from\nthe influenza virus have been used to combat the constantly changing strains of this virus.\nAntibiotics are a biotechnological product. They are naturally produced by microorganisms, such as fungi, to attain an\nadvantage over bacterial populations. Antibiotics are produced on a large scale by cultivating and manipulating fungal cells.\nRecombinant DNA technology was used to produce large-scale quantities of human insulin in E. coli as early as 1978.\nPreviously, it was only possible to treat diabetes with pig insulin, which caused allergic reactions in humans because of\ndifferences in the gene product. In addition, human growth hormone (HGH) is used to treat growth disorders in children.\nThe HGH gene was cloned from a cDNA library and inserted into E. coli cells by cloning it into a bacterial vector.\nTransgenic Animals\nAlthough several recombinant proteins used in medicine are successfully produced in bacteria, some proteins require a\neukaryotic animal host for proper processing. For this reason, the desired genes are cloned and expressed in animals, such\nas sheep, goats, chickens, and mice. Animals that have been modified to express recombinant DNA are called transgenic\nanimals. Several human proteins are expressed in the milk of transgenic sheep and goats, and some are expressed in the eggs\nof chickens. Mice have been used extensively for expressing and studying the effects of recombinant genes and mutations.\nTransgenic Plants\nManipulating the DNA of plants (i.e., creating GMOs) has helped to create desirable traits, such as disease resistance,\nherbicide and pesticide resistance, better nutritional value, and better shelf-life (Figure 17.9). Plants are the most important\nsource of food for the human population. Farmers developed ways to select for plant varieties with desirable traits long\nbefore modern-day biotechnology practices were established.\nFigure 17.9 Corn, a major agricultural crop used to create products for a variety of industries, is often modified through\nplant biotechnology. (credit: Keith Weller, USDA)\nPlants that have received recombinant DNA from other species are called transgenic plants. Because they are not natural,\ntransgenic plants and other GMOs are closely monitored by government agencies to ensure that they are fit for human\nconsumption and do not endanger other plant and animal life. Because foreign genes can spread to other species in the\nenvironment, extensive testing is required to ensure ecological stability. Staples like corn, potatoes, and tomatoes were the\nfirst crop plants to be genetically engineered.\n692\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nTransformation of Plants Using Agrobacterium tumefaciens\nGene transfer occurs naturally between species in microbial populations. Many viruses that cause human diseases act by\nincorporating their DNA into the human genome. In plants, tumors caused by the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens\noccur by transfer of DNA from the bacterium to the plant. Although the tumors do not kill the plants, they make the plants\nstunted and more susceptible to harsh environmental conditions. Many plants, such as walnuts, grapes, nut trees, and beets,\nare affected by A. tumefaciens. The artificial introduction of DNA into plant cells is more challenging than in animal cells\nbecause of the thick plant cell wall.\nResearchers used the natural transfer of DNA from Agrobacterium to a plant host to introduce DNA fragments of their\nchoice into plant hosts. In nature, the disease-causing A. tumefaciens have a set of plasmids, called the Ti plasmids (tumor-\ninducing plasmids), that contain genes for the production of tumors in plants. DNA from the Ti plasmid integrates into\nthe infected plant cell\u2019s genome. Researchers manipulate the Ti plasmids to remove the tumor-causing genes and insert the\ndesired DNA fragment for transfer into the plant genome. The Ti plasmids carry antibiotic resistance genes to aid selection\nand can be propagated in E. coli cells as well.\nThe Organic Insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis\nBacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a bacterium that produces protein crystals during sporulation that are toxic to many insect\nspecies that affect plants. Bt toxin has to be ingested by insects for the toxin to be activated. Insects that have eaten Bt toxin\nstop feeding on the plants within a few hours. After the toxin is activated in the intestines of the insects, death occurs within\na couple of days. Modern biotechnology has allowed plants to encode their own crystal Bt toxin that acts against insects.\nThe crystal toxin genes have been cloned from Bt and introduced into plants. Bt toxin has been found to be safe for the\nenvironment, non-toxic to humans and other mammals, and is approved for use by organic farmers as a natural insecticide.\nFlavr Savr Tomato\nThe first GM crop was in 1994.

        "summary": "Biotechnology involves using biological agents for technological advancement in fields such as medicine, agriculture, and industry. Modern biotechnology, which expanded rapidly after the discovery of DNA\u2019s structure in 1953, includes techniques for manipulating genetic material like DNA and RNA extraction, gel electrophoresis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), molecular cloning, and the creation of recombinant DNA. Applications range from genetic testing, gene therapy, and vaccine or hormone production to the development of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in plants and animals for desirable traits such as pest resistance, higher yields, and improved nutritional value. Methods like gene targeting, transformation using Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and incorporation of traits such as Bt toxin production or delayed ripening (e.g., Flavr Savr tomato) exemplify biotechnology\u2019s role in agriculture, while recombinant protein production, transgenic animals, and microbial engineering benefit medicine and industry. These advances raise ethical, safety, and ecological questions, particularly concerning GMOs, genetic data privacy, and potential environmental impacts."

Genome mapping is the process of finding the locations of\ngenes on each chromosome. The maps created by genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate\nstreets. A genetic map is an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome. Genetic maps provide the big\npicture (similar to a map of interstate highways) and use genetic markers (similar to landmarks). A genetic marker is a\ngene or sequence on a chromosome that co-segregates (shows genetic linkage) with a specific trait. Early geneticists called\nthis linkage analysis. Physical maps present the intimate details of smaller regions of the chromosomes (similar to a detailed\nroad map). A physical map is a representation of the physical distance, in nucleotides, between genes or genetic markers.\nBoth genetic linkage maps and physical maps are required to build a complete picture of the genome. Having a complete\nmap of the genome makes it easier for researchers to study individual genes. Human genome maps help researchers in their\nefforts to identify human disease-causing genes related to illnesses like cancer, heart disease, and cystic fibrosis. Genome\nmapping can be used in a variety of other applications, such as using live microbes to clean up pollutants or even prevent\npollution. Research involving plant genome mapping may lead to producing higher crop yields or developing plants that\nbetter adapt to climate change.\nGenetic Maps\nThe study of genetic maps begins with linkage analysis, a procedure that analyzes the recombination frequency between\ngenes to determine if they are linked or show independent assortment. The term linkage was used before the discovery\nof DNA. Early geneticists relied on the observation of phenotypic changes to understand the genotype of an organism.\nShortly after Gregor Mendel (the father of modern genetics) proposed that traits were determined by what are now known\nas genes, other researchers observed that different traits were often inherited together, and thereby deduced that the genes\nwere physically linked by being located on the same chromosome. The mapping of genes relative to each other based on\nlinkage analysis led to the development of the first genetic maps.\nObservations that certain traits were always linked and certain others were not linked came from studying the offspring of\ncrosses between parents with different traits. For example, in experiments performed on the garden pea, it was discovered\nthat the color of the flower and shape of the plant\u2019s pollen were linked traits, and therefore the genes encoding these traits\nwere in close proximity on the same chromosome. The exchange of DNA between homologous pairs of chromosomes is\ncalled genetic recombination, which occurs by the crossing over of DNA between homologous strands of DNA, such as\nnonsister chromatids. Linkage analysis involves studying the recombination frequency between any two genes. The greater\nthe distance between two genes, the higher the chance that a recombination event will occur between them, and the higher\nthe recombination frequency between them. Two possibilities for recombination between two nonsister chromatids during\n694\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nmeiosis are shown in Figure 17.10. If the recombination frequency between two genes is less than 50 percent, they are said\nto be linked.\nFigure 17.10 Crossover may occur at different locations on the chromosome. Recombination between genes A and B\nis more frequent than recombination between genes B and C because genes A and B are farther apart; a crossover is\ntherefore more likely to occur between them.\nThe generation of genetic maps requires markers, just as a road map requires landmarks (such as rivers and mountains).\nEarly genetic maps were based on the use of known genes as markers. More sophisticated markers, including those based\non non-coding DNA, are now used to compare the genomes of individuals in a population. Although individuals of a given\nspecies are genetically similar, they are not identical; every individual has a unique set of traits. These minor differences in\nthe genome between individuals in a population are useful for the purposes of genetic mapping. In general, a good genetic\nmarker is a region on the chromosome that shows variability or polymorphism (multiple forms) in the population.\nSome genetic markers used in generating genetic maps are restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), variable\nnumber of tandem repeats (VNTRs), microsatellite polymorphisms, and the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).\nRFLPs (sometimes pronounced \u201crif-lips\u201d) are detected when the DNA of an individual is cut with a restriction endonuclease\nthat recognizes specific sequences in the DNA to generate a series of DNA fragments, which are then analyzed by gel\nelectrophoresis. The DNA of every individual will give rise to a unique pattern of bands when cut with a particular\nset of restriction endonucleases; this is sometimes referred to as an individual\u2019s DNA \u201cfingerprint.\u201d Certain regions of\nthe chromosome that are subject to polymorphism will lead to the generation of the unique banding pattern. VNTRs\nare repeated sets of nucleotides present in the non-coding regions of DNA. Non-coding, or \u201cjunk,\u201d DNA has no known\nbiological function; however, research shows that much of this DNA is actually transcribed. While its function is uncertain,\nit is certainly active, and it may be involved in the regulation of coding genes. The number of repeats may vary in individual\norganisms of a population. Microsatellite polymorphisms are similar to VNTRs, but the repeat unit is very small. SNPs are\nvariations in a single nucleotide.\nBecause genetic maps rely completely on the natural process of recombination, mapping is affected by natural increases\nor decreases in the level of recombination in any given area of the genome. Some parts of the genome are recombination\nhotspots, whereas others do not show a propensity for recombination. For this reason, it is important to look at mapping\ninformation developed by multiple methods.\nPhysical Maps\nA physical map provides detail of the actual physical distance between genetic markers, as well as the number of\nnucleotides. There are three methods used to create a physical map: cytogenetic mapping, radiation hybrid mapping, and\nsequence mapping. Cytogenetic mapping uses information obtained by microscopic analysis of stained sections of the\nchromosome (Figure 17.11). It is possible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic\nmapping, but not the exact distance (number of base pairs). Radiation hybrid mapping uses radiation, such as x-rays, to\nbreak the DNA into fragments. The amount of radiation can be adjusted to create smaller or larger fragments. This technique\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\n695\novercomes the limitation of genetic mapping and is not affected by increased or decreased recombination frequency.\nSequence mapping resulted from DNA sequencing technology that allowed for the creation of detailed physical maps\nwith distances measured in terms of the number of base pairs. The creation of genomic libraries and complementary\nDNA (cDNA) libraries (collections of cloned sequences or all DNA from a genome) has sped up the process of physical\nmapping. A genetic site used to generate a physical map with sequencing technology (a sequence-tagged site, or STS) is a\nunique sequence in the genome with a known exact chromosomal location. An expressed sequence tag (EST) and a single\nsequence length polymorphism (SSLP) are common STSs. An EST is a short STS that is identified with cDNA libraries,\nwhile SSLPs are obtained from known genetic markers and provide a link between genetic maps and physical maps.\nFigure 17.11 A cytogenetic map shows the appearance of a chromosome after it is stained and examined under a\nmicroscope. (credit: National Human Genome Research Institute)\nIntegration of Genetic and Physical Maps\nGenetic maps provide the outline and physical maps provide the details. It is easy to understand why both types of\ngenome mapping techniques are important to show the big picture. Information obtained from each technique is used\nin combination to study the genome. Genomic mapping is being used with different model organisms that are used for\nresearch. Genome mapping is still an ongoing process, and as more advanced techniques are developed, more advances are\nexpected. Genome mapping is similar to completing a complicated puzzle using every piece of available data.

        "summary": "Genomics is the study of entire genomes, including the complete set of genes, their sequences, organization, and interactions, and genome mapping determines the locations of genes on chromosomes. Genetic maps give a broad overview of gene positions based on recombination frequencies, using genetic markers such as RFLPs, VNTRs, microsatellites, and SNPs, while physical maps show precise distances in nucleotides using methods like cytogenetic mapping, radiation hybrid mapping, and sequence mapping. Genetic maps help identify linked traits, as shown by early studies on pea plants, and physical maps provide finer detail, often integrating data from genomic and cDNA libraries. Both map types are essential for understanding genome structure and function, aiding research on disease-causing genes and applications like pollution control or crop improvement. Genome mapping integrates data from labs worldwide into public databases such as GenBank and tools like the NCBI genome viewer, which allow researchers to explore genes, compare species, and study disorders through resources like OMIM. Mapping remains an ongoing global effort that supports advances in medicine, agriculture, and environmental science."

However, you can study information in the section as optional or\nillustrative material.\nAlthough there have been significant advances in the medical sciences in recent years, doctors are still confounded by some\ndiseases, and they are using whole-genome sequencing to get to the bottom of the problem. Whole-genome sequencing is\na process that determines the DNA sequence of an entire genome. Whole-genome sequencing is a brute-force approach to\nproblem solving when there is a genetic basis at the core of a disease. Several laboratories now provide services to sequence,\nanalyze, and interpret entire genomes.\nWhole-exome sequencing is a lower-cost alternative to whole genome sequencing. In exome sequencing, only the coding,\nexon-producing regions of the DNA are sequenced. In 2010, whole-exome sequencing was used to save a young boy whose\nintestines had multiple mysterious abscesses. The child had several colon operations with no relief. Finally, whole-exome\nsequencing was performed, which revealed a defect in a pathway that controls apoptosis (programmed cell death). A bone-\nmarrow transplant was used to overcome this genetic disorder, leading to a cure for the boy. He was the first person to be\nsuccessfully treated based on a diagnosis made by whole-exome sequencing.\nThe Science Practice Challenge Questions contain additional test questions related to the material in this section that will\nhelp you prepare for the AP exam. These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 2.23][APLO 3.5][APLO 3.20][APLO 3.21]\nStrategies Used in Sequencing Projects\nThe basic sequencing technique used in all modern day sequencing projects is the chain termination method (also known\nas the dideoxy method), which was developed by Fred Sanger in the 1970s. The chain termination method involves DNA\nreplication of a single-stranded template with the use of a primer and a regular deoxynucleotide (dNTP), which is a\nmonomer, or a single unit, of DNA. The primer and dNTP are mixed with a small proportion of fluorescently labeled\ndideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs). The ddNTPs are monomers that are missing a hydroxyl group (\u2013OH) at the site at which\nanother nucleotide usually attaches to form a chain (Figure 17.12). Each ddNTP is labeled with a different color of\nfluorophore. Every time a ddNTP is incorporated in the growing complementary strand, it terminates the process of DNA\nreplication, which results in multiple short strands of replicated DNA that are each terminated at a different point during\nreplication. When the reaction mixture is processed by gel electrophoresis after being separated into single strands, the\nmultiple newly replicated DNA strands form a ladder because of the differing sizes. Because the ddNTPs are fluorescently\nlabeled, each band on the gel reflects the size of the DNA strand and the ddNTP that terminated the reaction. The different\ncolors of the fluorophore-labeled ddNTPs help identify the ddNTP incorporated at that position. Reading the gel on the\nbasis of the color of each band on the ladder produces the sequence of the template strand (Figure 17.13).\nFigure 17.12 A dideoxynucleotide is similar in structure to a deoxynucleotide, but is missing the 3' hydroxyl group\n(indicated by the box). When a dideoxynucleotide is incorporated into a DNA strand, DNA synthesis stops.\n698\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 17.13 Frederick Sanger's dideoxy chain termination method is illustrated. Using dideoxynucleotides, the DNA\nfragment can be terminated at different points. The DNA is separated on the basis of size, and these bands, based on\nthe size of the fragments, can be read.\nEarly Strategies: Shotgun Sequencing and Pair-Wise End Sequencing\nIn shotgun sequencing method, several copies of a DNA fragment are cut randomly into many smaller pieces (somewhat\nlike what happens to a round shot cartridge when fired from a shotgun). All of the segments are then sequenced using\nthe chain-sequencing method. Then, with the help of a computer, the fragments are analyzed to see where their sequences\noverlap. By matching up overlapping sequences at the end of each fragment, the entire DNA sequence can be reformed.\nA larger sequence that is assembled from overlapping shorter sequences is called a contig. As an analogy, consider that\nsomeone has four copies of a landscape photograph that you have never seen before and know nothing about how it should\nappear. The person then rips up each photograph with their hands, so that different size pieces are present from each copy.\nThe person then mixes all of the pieces together and asks you to reconstruct the photograph. In one of the smaller pieces\nyou see a mountain. In a larger piece, you see that the same mountain is behind a lake. A third fragment shows only the\nlake, but it reveals that there is a cabin on the shore of the lake. Therefore, from looking at the overlapping information in\nthese three fragments, you know that the picture contains a mountain behind a lake that has a cabin on its shore. This is the\nprinciple behind reconstructing entire DNA sequences using shotgun sequencing.\nOriginally, shotgun sequencing only analyzed one end of each fragment for overlaps. This was sufficient for sequencing\nsmall genomes. However, the desire to sequence larger genomes, such as that of a human, led to the development of double-\nbarrel shotgun sequencing, more formally known as pairwise-end sequencing. In pairwise-end sequencing, both ends of\neach fragment are analyzed for overlap. Pairwise-end sequencing is, therefore, more cumbersome than shotgun sequencing,\nbut it is easier to reconstruct the sequence because there is more available information.\nNext-generation Sequencing\nSince 2005, automated sequencing techniques used by laboratories are under the umbrella of next-generation sequencing,\nwhich is a group of automated techniques used for rapid DNA sequencing. These automated low-cost sequencers can\ngenerate sequences of hundreds of thousands or millions of short fragments (25 to 500 base pairs) in the span of one day.\nThese sequencers use sophisticated software to get through the cumbersome process of putting all the fragments in order.\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\n699\nComparing Sequences\nA sequence alignment is an arrangement of proteins, DNA, or RNA; it is used to identify regions of similarity\nbetween cell types or species, which may indicate conservation of function or structures. Sequence\nalignments may be used to construct phylogenetic trees. The following website uses a software program\ncalled BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32blast) .\nUnder \u201cBasic Blast,\u201d click \u201cNucleotide Blast.\u201d Input the following sequence into the large \"query sequence\"\nbox: ATTGCTTCGATTGCA. Below the box, locate the \"Species\" field and type \"human\" or \"Homo sapiens\".\nThen click \u201cBLAST\u201d to compare the inputted sequence against known sequences of the human genome.\nThe result is that this sequence occurs in over a hundred places in the human genome. Scroll down below\nthe graphic with the horizontal bars and you will see short description of each of the matching hits. Pick one\nof the hits near the top of the list and click on \"Graphics\". This will bring you to a page that shows where\nthe sequence is found within the entire human genome. You can move the slider that looks like a green flag\nback and forth to view the sequences immediately around the selected gene. You can then return to your\nselected sequence by clicking the \"ATG\" button.\nCytochrome c oxidase is a highly conserved protein found in bacteria and in the mitochondria of eukaryotes. Based on\nyour knowledge of evolutionary relationships, which of the following statements would you expect to be true of the\ncytochrome c oxidase protein sequence?\na.\nThe bacterial protein will be more similar to the human protein than the yeast protein.\nb.\nThe yeast protein will be more similar to the human protein than the bacterial protein.\nc.\nThe bacterial protein will be more similar to the yeast protein than the human protein.\nd.\nThe bacterial and yeast protein will share a similar sequence, but the human protein will be unrelated.\nUse of Whole-Genome Sequences of Model Organisms\nThe first genome to be completely sequenced was of a bacterial virus, the bacteriophage fx174 (5368 base pairs); this was\naccomplished by Fred Sanger using shotgun sequencing. Several other organelle and viral genomes were later sequenced.\nThe first organism whose genome was sequenced was the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae; this was accomplished by\nCraig Venter in the 1980s. Approximately 74 different laboratories collaborated on the sequencing of the genome of the\nyeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which began in 1989 and was completed in 1996, because it was 60 times bigger than any\nother genome that had been sequenced. By 1997, the genome sequences of two important model organisms were available:\nthe bacterium Escherichia coli K12 and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genomes of other model organisms, such as\nthe mouse Mus musculus, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the nematode Caenorhabditis. elegans, and humans Homo\nsapiens are now known. A lot of basic research is performed in model organisms because the information can be applied\nto genetically similar organisms. A model organism is a species that is studied as a model to understand the biological\nprocesses in other species represented by the model organism. Having entire genomes sequenced helps with the research\nefforts in these model organisms. The process of attaching biological information to gene sequences is called genome\nannotation. Annotation of gene sequences helps with basic experiments in molecular biology, such as designing PCR\nprimers and RNA targets.\n700\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nClick through each step of genome sequencing at this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/DNA_sequence) .\nHow is deep sequencing an improvement on Sanger sequencing?\na.\nDeep sequencing allows for much faster sequencing of short strands of DNA as compared to Sanger\nsequencing which, reads only short sequences of DNA at a slow rate.

However, you can study information in the section as optional or\nillustrative material.\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\n701\nThe introduction of DNA sequencing and whole genome sequencing projects, particularly the Human Genome project, has\nexpanded the applicability of DNA sequence information. Genomics is now being used in a wide variety of fields, such as\nmetagenomics, pharmacogenomics, and mitochondrial genomics. The most commonly known application of genomics is to\nunderstand and find cures for diseases.\nPredicting Disease Risk at the Individual Level\nPredicting the risk of disease involves screening currently healthy individuals by genome analysis at the individual level.\nIntervention with lifestyle changes and drugs can be recommended before disease onset. However, this approach is most\napplicable when the problem resides within a single gene defect. Such defects only account for approximately 5 percent\nof diseases in developed countries. Most of the common diseases, such as heart disease, are multi-factored or polygenic,\nwhich is a phenotypic characteristic that involves two or more genes, and also involve environmental factors such as diet.\nIn April 2010, scientists at Stanford University published the genome analysis of a healthy individual (Stephen Quake, a\nscientist at Stanford University, who had his genome sequenced); the analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various\ndiseases. A risk assessment was performed to analyze Quake\u2019s percentage of risk for 55 different medical conditions. A rare\ngenetic mutation was found, which showed him to be at risk for sudden heart attack. He was also predicted to have a 23\npercent risk of developing prostate cancer and a 1.4 percent risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s. The scientists used databases\nand several publications to analyze the genomic data. Even though genomic sequencing is becoming more affordable and\nanalytical tools are becoming more reliable, ethical issues surrounding genomic analysis at a population level remain to be\naddressed.\nFigure 17.14 PCA3 is a gene that is expressed in prostate epithelial cells and overexpressed in cancerous cells.\nA high concentration of PCA3 in urine is indicative of prostate cancer. The PCA3 test is considered to be a better\nindicator of cancer than the more well know PSA test, which measures the level of PSA (prostate-specific antigen)\nin the blood.\nIn 2011, the United States Preventative Services Task Force recommended against using the PSA test to screen healthy\nmen for prostate cancer. Their recommendation is based on evidence that screening does not reduce the risk of death\nfrom prostate cancer. Prostate cancer often develops very slowly and does not cause problems, while the cancer\ntreatment can have severe side effects. The PCA3 test is considered to be more accurate, but screening may still result\nin men who would not have been harmed by the cancer itself suffering side effects from treatment. What do you think?\nShould all healthy men be screened for prostate cancer using the PCA3 or PSA test? Should people in general be\nscreened to find out if they have a genetic risk for cancer or other diseases?\na.\nIn general, all men should be screened as it is necessary to take the risk.\nb.\nIn general, all men should be given treatment irrespective of the presence or absence of cancer symptoms.\nc.\nIn general, only men suspecting cancer should be screened.\nd.\nThere is no requirement of any screening, as cancer shows no problems.\n702\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nPharmacogenomics and Toxicogenomics\nPharmacogenomics, also called toxicogenomics, involves evaluating the effectiveness and safety of drugs on the basis of\ninformation from an individual's genomic sequence. Genomic responses to drugs can be studied using experimental animals\n(such as laboratory rats or mice) or live cells in the laboratory before embarking on studies with humans. Studying changes\nin gene expression could provide information about the transcription profile in the presence of the drug, which can be\nused as an early indicator of the potential for toxic effects. For example, genes involved in cellular growth and controlled\ncell death, when disturbed, could lead to the growth of cancerous cells. Genome-wide studies can also help to find new\ngenes involved in drug toxicity. Personal genome sequence information can be used to prescribe medications that will be\nmost effective and least toxic on the basis of the individual patient\u2019s genotype. The gene signatures may not be completely\naccurate, but can be tested further before pathologic symptoms arise.\nMicrobial Genomics: Metagenomics\nTraditionally, microbiology has been taught with the view that microorganisms are best studied under pure culture\nconditions, which involves isolating a single type of cell and culturing it in the laboratory. Because microorganisms can go\nthrough several generations in a matter of hours, their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment\nvery quickly. In addition, the vast majority of bacterial species resist being cultured in isolation. Most microorganisms do\nnot live as isolated entities, but in microbial communities known as biofilms. For all of these reasons, pure culture is not\nalways the best way to study microorganisms. Metagenomics is the study of the collective genomes of multiple species\nthat grow and interact in an environmental niche. Metagenomics can be used to identify new species more rapidly and to\nanalyze the effect of pollutants on the environment (Figure 17.15).\nFigure 17.15 Metagenomics involves isolating DNA from multiple species within an environmental niche.\nMicrobial Genomics: Creation of New Biofuels\nKnowledge of the genomics of microorganisms is being used to find better ways to harness biofuels from algae and\ncyanobacteria. The primary sources of fuel today are coal, oil, wood, and other plant products, such as ethanol. Although\nplants are renewable resources, there is still a need to find more alternative renewable sources of energy to meet our\npopulation\u2019s energy demands. The microbial world is one of the largest resources for genes that encode new enzymes\nand produce new organic compounds, and it remains largely untapped. Microorganisms are used to create products, such\nas enzymes that are used in research, antibiotics, and other anti-microbial mechanisms. Microbial genomics is helping to\ndevelop diagnostic tools, improved vaccines, new disease treatments, and advanced environmental cleanup techniques.\nMitochondrial Genomics\nMitochondria are intracellular organelles that contain their own DNA. Mitochondrial DNA mutates at a rapid rate and is\noften used to study evolutionary relationships. Another feature that makes studying the mitochondrial genome interesting is\nthat the mitochondrial DNA in most multicellular organisms is passed on from the mother during the process of fertilization.\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\n703\nFor this reason, mitochondrial genomics is often used to trace genealogy.\nInformation and clues obtained from DNA samples found at crime scenes have been used as evidence in court cases, and\ngenetic markers have been used in forensic analysis. Genomic analysis has also become useful in this field. In 2001, the\nfirst use of genomics in forensics was published. It was a collaborative attempt between academic research institutions\nand the FBI to solve the mysterious cases of anthrax communicated via the US Postal Service. Using microbial genomics,\nresearchers determined that a specific strain of anthrax was used in all the mailings.\nGenomics in Agriculture\nGenomics can reduce the trials and failures involved in scientific research to a certain extent, which could improve the\nquality and quantity of crop yields in agriculture. Linking traits to genes or gene signatures helps to improve crop breeding\nto generate hybrids with the most desirable qualities. Scientists use genomic data to identify desirable traits, and then\ntransfer those traits to a different organism. Scientists are discovering how genomics can improve the quality and quantity\nof agricultural production. For example, scientists could use desirable traits to create a useful product or enhance an existing\nproduct, such as making a drought-sensitive crop more tolerant of the dry season.\n17.5 | Genomics and Proteomics\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat is a proteome?\n\u2022\nWhat is a protein signature and what is its relevance to cancer screening?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nInformation presented in section is not in scope for AP\u00ae. However, you can study information in the section as optional or\nillustrative material.\nProteins are the final products of genes, which help perform the function encoded by the gene. Proteins are composed\nof amino acids and play important roles in the cell. All enzymes (except ribozymes) are proteins that act as catalysts to\naffect the rate of reactions. Proteins are also regulatory molecules, and some are hormones. Transport proteins, such as\nhemoglobin, help transport oxygen to various organs. Antibodies that defend against foreign particles are also proteins. In\nthe diseased state, protein function can be impaired because of changes at the genetic level or because of direct impact on a\nspecific protein.\nA proteome is the entire set of proteins produced by a cell type. Proteomes can be studied using the knowledge of\ngenomes because genes code for mRNAs, and the mRNAs encode proteins. Although mRNA analysis is a step in the\nright direction, not all mRNAs are translated into proteins. The study of the function of proteomes is called proteomics.\nProteomics complements genomics and is useful when scientists want to test their hypotheses that were based on genes.\nEven though all cells of a multicellular organism have the same set of genes, the set of proteins produced in different tissues\nis different and dependent on gene expression. Thus, the genome is constant, but the proteome varies and is dynamic within\nan organism. In addition, RNAs can be alternately spliced (cut and pasted to create novel combinations and novel proteins)\nand many proteins are modified after translation by processes such as proteolytic cleavage, phosphorylation, glycosylation,\nand ubiquitination. There are also protein-protein interactions, which complicate the study of proteomes. Although the\ngenome provides a blueprint, the final architecture depends on several factors that can change the progression of events that\ngenerate the proteome.\nMetabolomics is related to genomics and proteomics. Metabolomics involves the study of small molecule metabolites\nfound in an organism. The metabolome is the complete set of metabolites that are related to the genetic makeup of an\norganism. Metabolomics offers an opportunity to compare genetic makeup and physical characteristics, as well as genetic\nmakeup and environmental factors. The goal of metabolome research is to identify, quantify, and catalogue all of the\nmetabolites that are found in the tissues and fluids of living organisms.\nBasic Techniques in Protein Analysis\nThe ultimate goal of proteomics is to identify or compare the proteins expressed from a given genome under specific\nconditions, study the interactions between the proteins, and use the information to predict cell behavior or develop drug\ntargets. Just as the genome is analyzed using the basic technique of DNA sequencing, proteomics requires techniques\n704\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\n",
        "summary": "The application of genomics spans multiple fields, including medicine, environmental science, forensics, and agriculture. In medicine, genomics enables prediction of individual disease risk through genome analysis, allowing preventive interventions, though most common diseases are polygenic and influenced by environmental factors. Pharmacogenomics uses genetic information to assess drug safety and effectiveness, enabling personalized treatments, while metagenomics studies microbial communities in their natural environments to identify new species and assess environmental impacts. Microbial genomics is also advancing biofuel production, disease treatments, diagnostics, and environmental cleanup. Mitochondrial genomics aids in tracing ancestry and solving forensic cases, as demonstrated in the anthrax investigation. In agriculture, genomics is applied to improve crop quality and yield by linking genes to desirable traits, enhancing breeding strategies, and developing more resilient crops."

Genomic analysis has also become useful in this field. In 2001, the\nfirst use of genomics in forensics was published. It was a collaborative attempt between academic research institutions\nand the FBI to solve the mysterious cases of anthrax communicated via the US Postal Service. Using microbial genomics,\nresearchers determined that a specific strain of anthrax was used in all the mailings.\nGenomics in Agriculture\nGenomics can reduce the trials and failures involved in scientific research to a certain extent, which could improve the\nquality and quantity of crop yields in agriculture. Linking traits to genes or gene signatures helps to improve crop breeding\nto generate hybrids with the most desirable qualities. Scientists use genomic data to identify desirable traits, and then\ntransfer those traits to a different organism. Scientists are discovering how genomics can improve the quality and quantity\nof agricultural production. For example, scientists could use desirable traits to create a useful product or enhance an existing\nproduct, such as making a drought-sensitive crop more tolerant of the dry season.\n17.5 | Genomics and Proteomics\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat is a proteome?\n\u2022\nWhat is a protein signature and what is its relevance to cancer screening?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nInformation presented in section is not in scope for AP\u00ae. However, you can study information in the section as optional or\nillustrative material.\nProteins are the final products of genes, which help perform the function encoded by the gene. Proteins are composed\nof amino acids and play important roles in the cell. All enzymes (except ribozymes) are proteins that act as catalysts to\naffect the rate of reactions. Proteins are also regulatory molecules, and some are hormones. Transport proteins, such as\nhemoglobin, help transport oxygen to various organs. Antibodies that defend against foreign particles are also proteins. In\nthe diseased state, protein function can be impaired because of changes at the genetic level or because of direct impact on a\nspecific protein.\nA proteome is the entire set of proteins produced by a cell type. Proteomes can be studied using the knowledge of\ngenomes because genes code for mRNAs, and the mRNAs encode proteins. Although mRNA analysis is a step in the\nright direction, not all mRNAs are translated into proteins. The study of the function of proteomes is called proteomics.\nProteomics complements genomics and is useful when scientists want to test their hypotheses that were based on genes.\nEven though all cells of a multicellular organism have the same set of genes, the set of proteins produced in different tissues\nis different and dependent on gene expression. Thus, the genome is constant, but the proteome varies and is dynamic within\nan organism. In addition, RNAs can be alternately spliced (cut and pasted to create novel combinations and novel proteins)\nand many proteins are modified after translation by processes such as proteolytic cleavage, phosphorylation, glycosylation,\nand ubiquitination. There are also protein-protein interactions, which complicate the study of proteomes. Although the\ngenome provides a blueprint, the final architecture depends on several factors that can change the progression of events that\ngenerate the proteome.\nMetabolomics is related to genomics and proteomics. Metabolomics involves the study of small molecule metabolites\nfound in an organism. The metabolome is the complete set of metabolites that are related to the genetic makeup of an\norganism. Metabolomics offers an opportunity to compare genetic makeup and physical characteristics, as well as genetic\nmakeup and environmental factors. The goal of metabolome research is to identify, quantify, and catalogue all of the\nmetabolites that are found in the tissues and fluids of living organisms.\nBasic Techniques in Protein Analysis\nThe ultimate goal of proteomics is to identify or compare the proteins expressed from a given genome under specific\nconditions, study the interactions between the proteins, and use the information to predict cell behavior or develop drug\ntargets. Just as the genome is analyzed using the basic technique of DNA sequencing, proteomics requires techniques\n704\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nfor protein analysis. The basic technique for protein analysis, analogous to DNA sequencing, is mass spectrometry. Mass\nspectrometry is used to identify and determine the characteristics of a molecule. Advances in spectrometry have allowed\nresearchers to analyze very small samples of protein. X-ray crystallography, for example, enables scientists to determine the\nthree-dimensional structure of a protein crystal at atomic resolution. Another protein imaging technique, nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR), uses the magnetic properties of atoms to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins in aqueous\nsolution. Protein microarrays have also been used to study interactions between proteins. Large-scale adaptations of the\nbasic two-hybrid screen (Figure 17.16) have provided the basis for protein microarrays. Computer software is used to\nanalyze the vast amount of data generated for proteomic analysis.\nGenomic- and proteomic-scale analyses are part of systems biology. Systems biology is the study of whole biological\nsystems (genomes and proteomes) based on interactions within the system. The European Bioinformatics Institute and the\nHuman Proteome Organization (HUPO) are developing and establishing effective tools to sort through the enormous pile\nof systems biology data. Because proteins are the direct products of genes and reflect activity at the genomic level, it is\nnatural to use proteomes to compare the protein profiles of different cells to identify proteins and genes involved in disease\nprocesses. Most pharmaceutical drug trials target proteins. Information obtained from proteomics is being used to identify\nnovel drugs and understand their mechanisms of action.\nFigure 17.16 Two-hybrid screening is used to determine whether two proteins interact. In this method, a transcription\nfactor is split into a DNA-binding domain (BD) and an activator domain (AD). The binding domain is able to bind the\npromoter in the absence of the activator domain, but it does not turn on transcription. A protein called the bait is\nattached to the BD, and a protein called the prey is attached to the AD. Transcription occurs only if the prey \u201ccatches\u201d\nthe bait.\nThe challenge of techniques used for proteomic analyses is the difficulty in detecting small quantities of proteins. Although\nmass spectrometry is good for detecting small amounts of proteins, variations in protein expression in diseased states can\nbe difficult to discern. Proteins are naturally unstable molecules, which makes proteomic analysis much more difficult than\ngenomic analysis.\nCancer Proteomics\nGenomes and proteomes of patients suffering from specific diseases are being studied to understand the genetic basis of\nthe disease. The most prominent disease being studied with proteomic approaches is cancer. Proteomic approaches are\nbeing used to improve screening and early detection of cancer; this is achieved by identifying proteins whose expression\nis affected by the disease process. An individual protein is called a biomarker, whereas a set of proteins with altered\nexpression levels is called a protein signature. For a biomarker or protein signature to be useful as a candidate for early\nscreening and detection of a cancer, it must be secreted in body fluids, such as sweat, blood, or urine, such that large-\nscale screenings can be performed in a non-invasive fashion. The current problem with using biomarkers for the early\ndetection of cancer is the high rate of false-negative results. A false negative is an incorrect test result that should have\nbeen positive. In other words, many cases of cancer go undetected, which makes biomarkers unreliable. Some examples of\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\n705\nprotein biomarkers used in cancer detection are CA-125 for ovarian cancer and PSA for prostate cancer. Protein signatures\nmay be more reliable than biomarkers to detect cancer cells. Proteomics is also being used to develop individualized\ntreatment plans, which involves the prediction of whether or not an individual will respond to specific drugs and the side\neffects that the individual may experience. Proteomics is also being used to predict the possibility of disease recurrence.\nThe National Cancer Institute has developed programs to improve the detection and treatment of cancer. The Clinical\nProteomic Technologies for Cancer and the Early Detection Research Network are efforts to identify protein signatures\nspecific to different types of cancers. The Biomedical Proteomics Program is designed to identify protein signatures and\ndesign effective therapies for cancer patients.\n706\nChapter 17 | Biotechnology and Genomics\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nantibiotic resistance\nbiomarker\nbiotechnology\ncDNA library\ncellular cloning\nchain termination method\nclone\ncontig\ncytogenetic mapping\ndeoxynucleotide\ndideoxynucleotide\nDNA microarray\nexpressed sequence tag (EST)\nfalse negative\nforeign DNA\ngel electrophoresis\ngene targeting\ngene therapy\ngenetic diagnosis\ngenetic engineering\ngenetic map\ngenetic marker\ngenetic recombination\ngenetic testing\ngenetically modified organism (GMO)\ngenome annotation\ngenome mapping\ngenomic library\ngenomics\nhost DNA\nKEY TERMS\nability of an organism to be unaffected by the actions of an antibiotic\nindividual protein that is uniquely produced in a diseased state\nuse of biological agents for technological advancement\ncollection of cloned cDNA sequences\nproduction of identical cell populations by binary fission\nmethod of DNA sequencing using labeled dideoxynucleotides to terminate DNA\nreplication;

        "summary": "Proteins, the functional products of genes, perform vital roles in cells such as catalyzing reactions, regulating processes, transporting molecules, and defending against pathogens, and their impairment can result from genetic changes or direct damage. The complete set of proteins produced by a cell type is called its proteome, which varies between tissues and conditions, unlike the constant genome. Proteomics, the study of proteomes, complements genomics by examining protein expression, modifications, and interactions to understand cell behavior, develop drug targets, and analyze disease mechanisms; relatedly, metabolomics studies an organism\u2019s small-molecule metabolites. Techniques like mass spectrometry, X-ray crystallography, NMR, protein microarrays, and two-hybrid screening are used for protein analysis, although challenges include detecting small quantities and instability of proteins. In cancer research, proteomics aims to identify biomarkers (single disease-associated proteins) and protein signatures (sets of proteins with altered expression) for early detection, screening, and personalized treatment; however, biomarkers often suffer from high false-negative rates, making protein signatures potentially more reliable. Initiatives like the National Cancer Institute\u2019s programs seek to improve detection, treatment, and recurrence prediction through the identification of cancer-specific protein profiles."

From biological molecules to biomes, the one theme that remains consistent is evolution. All species of living\norganisms are descended from a common ancestor. Although it may seem that living things today stay much the same, this\nis not the case. Evolution is actually an ongoing process. Additionally, new species are discovered regularly. For example,\nscientists have used a method called fluorescent in situ hybridization, which uses fluorescent probes to locate specific genes\non chromosomes, to discover a green sea slug that can perform photosynthesis just like a plant.\n[1] The slug obtains genes\nrelated to photosynthesis from the algae it eats through a process called horizontal gene transfer. In this process, genes can\nbe transferred directly from one cell to another. The algal genes code for products that repair and maintain chloroplasts eaten\nby the slug. You can read more about it at this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32slug) .\n1. Biol. Bull. 227: 300\u2013312. (December 2014)\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\n719\n18.1 | Understanding Evolution\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow was the present-day theory of evolution developed?\n\u2022\nWhat is adaptation, and how does adaptation relate to natural selection?\n\u2022\nWhat are the differences between convergent and divergent evolution, and what are examples of each that support\nevolution by natural selection?\n\u2022\nWhat are examples of homologous and vestigial structures, and what evidence do these structures provide to\nsupport patterns of evolution?\n\u2022\nWhat are common misconceptions about the theory of evolution?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nMillions of species, from bacteria to blueberries to baboons, currently call Earth their home, but these organisms evolved\nfrom different species. Furthermore, scientists estimate that several million more species will become extinct before they\nhave been classified and studied. But why don\u2019t polar bears naturally inhabit deserts or rain forests, except, perhaps, in\nmovies? Why do humans possess traits, such as opposable thumbs, that are unique to primates but not other mammals?\nHow did observations of finches by Charles Darwin visiting the Galapagos Islands in the 1800s provide the foundation for\nour modern understanding of evolution?\nThe theory of evolution as proposed by Darwin is the unifying theory of biology. The tenet that all life has evolved and\ndiversified from a common ancestor is the foundation from which we approach all questions in biology. As we learned in\nour exploration of the structure and function of DNA, variations in individuals within a population occur through mutation,\nallowing more desirable traits to be passed to the next generation. Due to competition for resources and other environmental\npressures, individuals possessing more favorable adaptive characteristics are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing\nthose characteristics to the next generation with increased frequency. When environments change, what was once an\nunfavorable trait may become a favorable one. Organisms may evolve in response to their changing environment by the\naccumulation of favorable traits in succeeding generations. Thus, evolution by natural selection explains both the unity\nand diversity of life.\nConvergent evolution occurs when similar traits with the same function evolve in multiple species exposed to similar\nselection pressure, such as the wings of bats and insects. In divergent evolution, two species evolve in different directions\nfrom a common point, such as the forelimbs of humans, dogs, birds, and whales. Although Darwin\u2019s theory was\nrevolutionary for its time because it contrasted with long-held ideas (for example, Lamarck proposed the inheritance of\nacquired characteristics), evidence drawn from many scientific disciplines, including the fossil record, the existence of\nhomologous and vestigial structures, mathematics, and DNA analysis supports evolution through natural selection. It is\nalso important to understand that evolution continues to occur; for example, bacteria that evolve resistance to antibiotics or\nplants that become resistant to pesticides provide evidence for continuing change.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in this section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 1 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework. The AP\u00ae Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent\nfoundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP\u00ae exam\nquestions.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 1.10][APLO 1.12][APLO 1.13][APLO 1.31][APLO 1.32][APLO 1.27][APLO 1.28][APLO 1.30][APLO\n1.14][APLO 1.29][APLO 1.26][APLO 4.8]\nThe Origin of Life\nHumans have adopted many theories regarding the origin of life over the course of our time on Earth. Early civilizations\nbelieved that life was created by supernatural forces. Organisms were \u201chand-made\u201d to be perfectly adapted to their\nenvironment and, therefore, did not change over time. Some early thinkers, such as the Greek philosopher Aristotle,\nbelieved that organisms belonged to a ladder of increasing complexity. Based on this understanding, scientists such as\nCarolus Linnaeus attempted to organize all living things into classification schemes that demonstrated an increasing\ncomplexity of life.\nOver time, however, scientists came to understand that life was constantly evolving on Earth. Georges Cuvier found that\nfossilized remains or organisms changed as he dug into deeper rock layers (strata), indicating that the organisms present in\nthe area had changed over time. This observation led Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck to hypothesize that organisms adapted to\ntheir environment by changing over time. As organisms used different parts of their body, those parts improved, and these\nchanges were passed down to their offspring. Ultimately, these theories were disproven by scientists, but their development\ncontributed to the theory of evolution that was finally formulated by Charles Darwin.\nCharles Darwin and Natural Selection\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, the actual mechanism for evolution was independently conceived of and described by two\nnaturalists: Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. Importantly, each naturalist spent time exploring the natural world\non expeditions to the tropics. From 1831 to 1836, Darwin traveled around the world on H.M.S. Beagle, including stops\nin South America, Australia, and the southern tip of Africa. Wallace traveled to Brazil to collect insects in the Amazon\nrainforest from 1848 to 1852 and to the Malay Archipelago from 1854 to 1862. Darwin\u2019s journey, like Wallace\u2019s later\njourneys to the Malay Archipelago, included stops at several island chains, the last being the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands west of\nEcuador. On these islands, Darwin observed species of organisms on different islands that were clearly similar, yet had\ndistinct differences. For example, the ground finches inhabiting the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands comprised several species with\na unique beak shape (Figure 18.2). The species on the islands had a graded series of beak sizes and shapes with very\nsmall differences between the most similar. He observed that these finches closely resembled another finch species on the\nmainland of South America. Darwin imagined that the island species might be species modified from one of the original\nmainland species. Upon further study, he realized that the varied beaks of each finch helped the birds acquire a specific\ntype of food. For example, seed-eating finches had stronger, thicker beaks for breaking seeds, and insect-eating finches had\nspear-like beaks for stabbing their prey.\nFigure 18.2 Darwin observed that beak shape varies among finch species. He postulated that the beak of an ancestral\nspecies had adapted over time to equip the finches to acquire different food sources.\nWallace and Darwin both observed similar patterns in other organisms and they independently developed the same\nexplanation for how and why such changes could take place. Darwin called this mechanism natural selection. Natural\n722\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nselection, also known as \u201csurvival of the fittest,\u201d is the more prolific reproduction of individuals with favorable traits that\nsurvive environmental change because of those traits; this leads to evolutionary change.\nFor example, a population of giant tortoises found in the Galapagos Archipelago was observed by Darwin to have longer\nnecks than those that lived on other islands with dry lowlands. These tortoises were \u201cselected\u201d because they could reach\nmore leaves and access more food than those with short necks. In times of drought when fewer leaves would be available,\nthose that could reach more leaves had a better chance to eat and survive than those that couldn\u2019t reach the food source.\nConsequently, long-necked tortoises would be more likely to be reproductively successful and pass the long-necked trait to\ntheir offspring. Over time, only long-necked tortoises would be present in the population.\nNatural selection, Darwin argued, was an inevitable outcome of three principles that operated in nature. First, most\ncharacteristics of organisms are inherited, or passed from parent to offspring. Although no one, including Darwin and\nWallace, knew how this happened at the time, it was a common understanding. Second, more offspring are produced than\nare able to survive, so resources for survival and reproduction are limited. The capacity for reproduction in all organisms\noutstrips the availability of resources to support their numbers. Thus, there is competition for those resources in each\ngeneration. Both Darwin and Wallace\u2019s understanding of this principle came from reading an essay by the economist\nThomas Malthus who discussed this principle in relation to human populations. Third, offspring vary among each other in\nregard to their characteristics and those variations are inherited. Darwin and Wallace reasoned that offspring with inherited\ncharacteristics which allow them to best compete for limited resources will survive and have more offspring than those\nindividuals with variations that are less able to compete. Because characteristics are inherited, these traits will be better\nrepresented in the next generation. This will lead to change in populations over generations in a process that Darwin\ncalled descent with modification. Ultimately, natural selection leads to greater adaptation of the population to its local\nenvironment; it is the only mechanism known for adaptive evolution.\nPapers by Darwin and Wallace (Figure 18.3) presenting the idea of natural selection were read together in 1858 before the\nLinnean Society in London. The following year Darwin\u2019s book, On the Origin of Species, was published. His book outlined\nin considerable detail his arguments for evolution by natural selection.\nFigure 18.3 Both (a) Charles Darwin and (b) Alfred Wallace wrote scientific papers on natural selection that were\npresented together before the Linnean Society in 1858.\nDemonstrations of evolution by natural selection are time consuming and difficult to obtain. One of the best examples has\nbeen demonstrated in the very birds that helped to inspire Darwin\u2019s theory: the Gal\u00e1pagos finches. Peter and Rosemary\nGrant and their colleagues have studied Gal\u00e1pagos finch populations every year since 1976 and have provided important\ndemonstrations of natural selection. The Grants found changes from one generation to the next in the distribution of beak\nshapes with the medium ground finch on the Gal\u00e1pagos island of Daphne Major. The birds have inherited variation in the\nbill shape with some birds having wide deep bills and others having thinner bills. During a period in which rainfall was\nhigher than normal because of an El Ni\u00f1o, the large hard seeds that large-billed birds ate were reduced in number; however,\nthere was an abundance of the small soft seeds which the small-billed birds ate. Therefore, survival and reproduction were\nmuch better in the following years for the small-billed birds. In the years following this El Ni\u00f1o, the Grants measured beak\nsizes in the population and found that the average bill size was smaller. Since bill size is an inherited trait, parents with\nsmaller bills had more offspring and the size of bills had evolved to be smaller. As conditions improved in 1987 and larger\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\n723\nseeds became more available, the trend toward smaller average bill size ceased.\nField Biologist\nMany people hike, explore caves, scuba dive, or climb mountains for recreation. People often participate\nin these activities hoping to see wildlife. Experiencing the outdoors can be incredibly enjoyable and\ninvigorating. What if your job was to be outside in the wilderness? Field biologists by definition work outdoors\nin the \u201cfield.\u201d The term field in this case refers to any location outdoors, even under water. A field biologist\ntypically focuses research on a certain species, group of organisms, or a single habitat (Figure 18.4).\nFigure 18.4 A field biologist tranquilizes a polar bear for study. (credit: Karen Rhode)\nOne objective of many field biologists includes discovering new species that have never been recorded.\nNot only do such findings expand our understanding of the natural world, but they also lead to important\ninnovations in fields such as medicine and agriculture. Plant and microbial species, in particular, can reveal\nnew medicinal and nutritive knowledge. Other organisms can play key roles in ecosystems or be considered\nrare and in need of protection. When discovered, these important species can be used as evidence for\nenvironmental regulations and laws.\nProcesses and Patterns of Evolution\nNatural selection can only take place if there is variation, or differences, among individuals in a population. Importantly,\nthese differences must have some genetic basis; otherwise, the selection will not lead to change in the next generation.\nThis is critical because variation among individuals can be caused by non-genetic reasons such as an individual being taller\nbecause of better nutrition rather than different genes.\nGenetic diversity in a population comes from two main mechanisms: mutation and sexual reproduction. Mutation, a change\nin DNA, is the ultimate source of new alleles, or new genetic variation in any population. The genetic changes caused\nby mutation can have one of three outcomes on the phenotype. A mutation can affect the phenotype of the organism in a\nway that gives it reduced fitness\u2014lower likelihood of survival or fewer offspring. Alternatively, a mutation may produce a\nphenotype with a beneficial effect on fitness. And, many mutations will also have no effect on the fitness of the phenotype;\nthese are called neutral mutations. Mutations may also have a whole range of effect sizes on the fitness of the organism that\nexpresses them in their phenotype, from a small effect to a great effect. Sexual reproduction also leads to genetic diversity:\nwhen two parents reproduce, unique combinations of alleles assemble to produce the unique genotypes and thus phenotypes\nin each of the offspring.\nA heritable trait that helps the survival and reproduction of an organism in its present environment is called an adaptation.\nScientists describe groups of organisms becoming adapted to their environment when a change in the range of genetic\nvariation occurs over time that increases or maintains the \u201cfit\u201d of the population to its environment. The webbed feet\n724\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nof platypuses are an adaptation for swimming. The snow leopards\u2019 thick fur is an adaptation for living in the cold. The\ncheetahs\u2019 fast speed is an adaptation for catching prey.\nThese adaptations can occur through the rearrangements of entire genomes or can be caused by the mutation of a single\ngene. For example, dogs have 78 chromosomes while cats have 38. A large number of the characteristics that distinguish\ndogs from cats arose from chromosomal rearrangements that have occurred since both groups diverged from their last\ncommon ancestor. On the other hand, certain mice are white and other mice are black. The difference in fur color occurs\nthrough the mutation of a single gene. Thus, as a result of a single mutation, a mouse population can become more adapted\nto survive in snowy environments versus a dark, forest floor.\nWhether or not a trait is favorable depends on the environmental conditions at the time. The same traits are not always\nselected because environmental conditions can change. For example, consider a species of plant that grew in a moist climate\nand did not need to conserve water. Large leaves were selected because they allowed the plant to obtain more energy from\nthe sun. Large leaves require more water to maintain than small leaves, and the moist environment provided favorable\nconditions to support large leaves. After thousands of years, the climate changed, and the area no longer had excess water.\nThe direction of natural selection shifted so that plants with small leaves were selected because those populations were able\nto conserve water to survive the new environmental conditions.\nThe evolution of species has resulted in enormous variation in form and function. Sometimes, evolution gives rise to groups\nof organisms that become tremendously different from each other. When two species evolve in diverse directions from a\ncommon point, it is called divergent evolution. Such divergent evolution can be seen in the forms of the reproductive organs\nof flowering plants which share the same basic anatomies; however, they can look very different as a result of selection in\ndifferent physical environments and adaptation to different kinds of pollinators (Figure 18.5).\nFigure 18.5 Flowering plants evolved from a common ancestor. Notice that the (a) dense blazing star (Liatrus spicata)\nand the (b) purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea) vary in appearance, yet both share a similar basic morphology.\n(credit a: modification of work by Drew Avery; credit b: modification of work by Cory Zanker)\nIn other cases, similar phenotypes evolve independently in distantly related species. For example, flight has evolved in both\nbats and insects, and they both have structures we refer to as wings, which are adaptations to flight. However, the wings\nof bats and insects have evolved from very different original structures. This phenomenon is called convergent evolution,\nwhere similar traits evolve independently in species that do not share a common ancestry. The two species came to the same\nfunction, flying, but did so separately from each other.\nThese physical changes occur over enormous spans of time and help explain how evolution occurs. Natural selection acts on\nindividual organisms, which in turn can shape an entire species. Although natural selection may work in a single generation\non an individual, it can take thousands or even millions of years for the genotype of an entire species to evolve. It is over\nthese large time spans that life on earth has changed and continues to change.\nEvidence of Evolution\nThe evidence for evolution is compelling and extensive. Looking at every level of organization in living systems, biologists\nsee the signature of past and present evolution. Darwin dedicated a large portion of his book, On the Origin of Species, to\nidentifying patterns in nature that were consistent with evolution, and since Darwin, our understanding has become clearer\nand broader.\nFossils\nFossils provide solid evidence that organisms from the past are not the same as those found today, and fossils show a\nprogression of evolution. Scientists determine the age of fossils and categorize them from all over the world to determine\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\n725\nwhen the organisms lived relative to each other. The resulting fossil record tells the story of the past and shows the evolution\nof form over millions of years (Figure 18.6). For example, scientists have recovered highly detailed records showing the\nevolution of humans and horses.\nFigure 18.6 In this (a) display, fossil hominids are arranged from oldest (bottom) to newest (top). As hominids evolved,\nthe shape of the skull changed. An artist\u2019s rendition of (b) extinct species of the genus Equus reveals that these ancient\nspecies resembled the modern horse (Equus ferus) but varied in size.\nAnatomy and Embryology\nAnother type of evidence for evolution is the presence of structures in organisms that share the same basic form. For\nexample, the bones in the appendages of a human, dog, bird, and whale all share the same overall construction (Figure 18.7)\nresulting from their origin in the appendages of a common ancestor. Over time, evolution led to changes in the shapes and\nsizes of these bones in different species, but they have maintained the same overall layout. Scientists call these synonymous\nparts homologous structures.\nFigure 18.7 The similar construction of these appendages indicates that these organisms share a common ancestor.\nSome structures exist in organisms that have no apparent function at all, and appear to be residual parts from a past common\nancestor. These unused structures without function are called vestigial structures. Examples of vestigial structures include\nwings on flightless birds, leaves on some cacti, and hind leg bones in whales.\n726\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nVisit this interactive site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/bone_structures) to guess which bones structures are\nhomologous and which are analogous, and see examples of evolutionary adaptations to illustrate these concepts.\nWhat is the basic difference between things that are homologous and things that are analogous?\na.\nThings that are analogous look similar and things that are homologous do not.\nb.\nThings that are analogous have the same function and things that are homologous have different functions.\nc.\nThings that are analogous are not a result of evolution, whereas things that are homologous are.\nd.\nThings that are analogous result from convergence and things that are homologous result from common\nancestry\nAnother evidence of evolution is the convergence of form in organisms that share similar environments. For example,\nspecies of unrelated animals, such as the arctic fox and ptarmigan, living in the arctic region have been selected for seasonal\nwhite phenotypes during winter to blend with the snow and ice (Figure 18.8ab). These similarities occur not because of\ncommon ancestry, but because of similar selection pressures\u2014the benefits of not being seen by predators.\nFigure 18.8 The white winter coat of the (a) arctic fox and the (b) ptarmigan\u2019s plumage are adaptations to their\nenvironments. (credit a: modification of work by Keith Morehouse)\nEmbryology, the study of the development of the anatomy of an organism to its adult form, also provides evidence\nof relatedness between now widely divergent groups of organisms. Mutational tweaking in the embryo can have such\nmagnified consequences in the adult that embryo formation tends to be conserved. As a result, structures that are absent\nin some groups often appear in their embryonic forms and disappear by the time the adult or juvenile form is reached. For\nexample, all vertebrate embryos, including humans, exhibit gill slits and tails at some point in their early development.\nThese disappear in the adults of terrestrial groups but are maintained in adult forms of aquatic groups such as fish and some\namphibians. Great ape embryos, including humans, have a tail structure during their development that is lost by the time of\nbirth.\nBiogeography\nThe geographic distribution of organisms on the planet follows patterns that are best explained by evolution in conjunction\nwith the movement of tectonic plates over geological time. Broad groups that evolved before the breakup of the\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\n727\nsupercontinent Pangaea (about 200 million years ago) are distributed worldwide. Groups that evolved since the breakup\nappear uniquely in regions of the planet, such as the unique flora and fauna of northern continents that formed from the\nsupercontinent Laurasia and of the southern continents that formed from the supercontinent Gondwana. The presence of\nmembers of the plant family Proteaceae in Australia, southern Africa, and South America, for example, is best explained by\ntheir presence prior to the southern supercontinent Gondwana breaking up.\nThe great diversification of marsupials in Australia and the absence of other mammals reflect Australia\u2019s long isolation.\nAustralia has an abundance of endemic species\u2014species found nowhere else\u2014which is typical of islands whose isolation\nby expanses of water prevents species from migrating. Over time, these species diverge evolutionarily into new species that\nlook very different from their ancestors that may exist on the mainland. The marsupials of Australia, the finches on the\nGal\u00e1pagos, and many species on the Hawaiian Islands are all unique to their one point of origin, yet they display distant\nrelationships to ancestral species on mainlands.\nMolecular Biology\nLike anatomical structures, the structures of the molecules of life reflect descent with modification. Evidence of a common\nancestor for all of life is reflected in the universality of DNA as the genetic material and in the near universality of\nthe genetic code and the machinery of DNA replication and expression. Fundamental divisions in life between the three\ndomains are reflected in major structural differences in otherwise conservative structures such as the components of\nribosomes and the structures of membranes. In general, the relatedness of groups of organisms is reflected in the similarity\nof their DNA sequences\u2014exactly the pattern that would be expected from descent and diversification from a common\nancestor.\nDNA sequences have also shed light on some of the mechanisms of evolution. For example, it is clear that the evolution of\nnew functions for proteins commonly occurs after gene duplication events that allow the free modification of one copy by\nmutation, selection, or drift (changes in a population\u2019s gene pool resulting from chance), while the second copy continues\nto produce a functional protein.\nDirect Observations\nScientists have also observed evolution occurring in both the laboratory and in the wild. A common example of this is the\nspread of antibiotic resistant genes in a population of bacteria. When bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, alleles that help the\norganism survive increase in frequency Figure 18.9. This is because individuals that cannot resist the antibacterial die off,\nleaving only individuals with the resistance gene to reproduce.\nFigure 18.9\nAdaptations for homeostasis\nOne major reason that organisms adapt is to maintain homeostasis, one of the main characteristics of life. All organisms\nhave likely descended from a single common ancestor, which is why so many organisms share anatomical, morphological,\nand molecular features. However, each organism has adapted these similar features to suit their environment and adapt to\n728\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nenvironmental changes over time. For example, all organisms use DNA polymerase to replicate their genomes. However,\nwhereas organisms with small genomes can get away with just a single polymerase molecule working at one point in the\ngenome at time, organisms with larger genomes replicate many points of the genome simultaneously. Other organisms\nthat live in extremely hot environments, such as deep-sea thermal vents, have specialized polymerase molecules that can\nwithstand the heat that would quickly denature the polymerases in land-based animals. Although the basis for each of these\ndifferent DNA polymerase molecules is the same, each one has been adapted to function in the organism\u2019s environmental\nniche.\nMisconceptions of Evolution\nAlthough the theory of evolution generated some controversy when it was first proposed, it was almost universally accepted\nby biologists, particularly younger biologists, within 20 years after publication of On the Origin of Species. Nevertheless,\nthe theory of evolution is a difficult concept and misconceptions about how it works abound.\nThis site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/misconceptions) addresses some of the main misconceptions associated with the\ntheory of evolution.\nSelect one misconception about evolution and explain what you might say to someone to dispel it.\na.\nMisconception: Evolution is not a well-founded theory. Correction: Although evolution cannot be observed\noccurring today, there is strong evidence in the fossil record and in shared DNA sequences to support the\ntheory\nb.\nMisconception: Humans are not currently evolving. Correction: The environmental pressures humans face\nare different than the ones they faced several thousands of years ago, but they are still there, and they are still\nproducing (slowly!) evolutionary change.\nc.\nMisconception: Evolution produces individuals that are perfectly fit to their environment. Correction:\nEvolution produces random changes in the genetic code that sometimes lead to adaptations\nd.\nMisconception: Evolution is a random process. Correction: evolution is a force that makes animals adapt to\nperfectly fit the environment they are living in\nEvolution Is Just a Theory\nCritics of the theory of evolution dismiss its importance by purposefully confounding the everyday usage of the word\n\u201ctheory\u201d with the way scientists use the word. In science, a \u201ctheory\u201d is understood to be a body of thoroughly tested and\nverified explanations for a set of observations of the natural world. Scientists have a theory of the atom, a theory of gravity,\nand the theory of relativity, each of which describes understood facts about the world. In the same way, the theory of\nevolution describes facts about the living world. As such, a theory in science has survived significant efforts to discredit\nit by scientists. In contrast, a \u201ctheory\u201d in common vernacular is a word meaning a guess or suggested explanation; this\nmeaning is more akin to the scientific concept of \u201chypothesis.\u201d When critics of evolution say evolution is \u201cjust a theory,\u201d\nthey are implying that there is little evidence supporting it and that it is still in the process of being rigorously tested. This\nis a mischaracterization.\nIndividuals Evolve\nEvolution is the change in genetic composition of a population over time, specifically over generations, resulting from\ndifferential reproduction of individuals with certain alleles. Individuals do change over their lifetime, obviously, but this is\ncalled development and involves changes programmed by the set of genes the individual acquired at birth in coordination\nwith the individual\u2019s environment. When thinking about the evolution of a characteristic, it is probably best to think about\nthe change of the average value of the characteristic in the population over time. For example, when natural selection leads\nto bill-size change in medium-ground finches in the Gal\u00e1pagos, this does not mean that individual bills on the finches are\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\n729\nchanging. If one measures the average bill size among all individuals in the population at one time and then measures the\naverage bill size in the population several years later, this average value will be different as a result of evolution. Although\nsome individuals may survive from the first time to the second, they will still have the same bill size; however, there will be\nmany new individuals that contribute to the shift in average bill size.\nEvolution Explains the Origin of Life\nIt is a common misunderstanding that evolution includes an explanation of life\u2019s origins. Conversely, some of the theory\u2019s\ncritics believe that it cannot explain the origin of life. The theory does not try to explain the origin of life. The theory of\nevolution explains how populations change over time and how life diversifies the origin of species. It does not shed light on\nthe beginnings of life including the origins of the first cells, which is how life is defined. The mechanisms of the origin of\nlife on Earth are a particularly difficult problem because it occurred a very long time ago, and presumably it just occurred\nonce. Importantly, biologists believe that the presence of life on Earth precludes the possibility that the events that led to\nlife on Earth can be repeated because the intermediate stages would immediately become food for existing living things.\nHowever, once a mechanism of inheritance was in place in the form of a molecule like DNA either within a cell or pre-cell,\nthese entities would be subject to the principle of natural selection. More effective reproducers would increase in frequency\nat the expense of inefficient reproducers. So while evolution does not explain the origin of life, it may have something to\nsay about some of the processes operating once pre-living entities acquired certain properties.\nOrganisms Evolve on Purpose\nStatements such as \u201corganisms evolve in response to a change in an environment\u201d are quite common, but such statements\ncan lead to two types of misunderstandings. First, the statement must not be understood to mean that individual organisms\nevolve. The statement is shorthand for \u201ca population evolves in response to a changing environment.\u201d However, a\nsecond misunderstanding may arise by interpreting the statement to mean that the evolution is somehow intentional.\nA changed environment results in some individuals in the population, those with particular phenotypes, benefiting and\ntherefore producing proportionately more offspring than other phenotypes. This results in change in the population if the\ncharacteristics are genetically determined.\nIt is also important to understand that the variation that natural selection works on is already in a population and does not\narise in response to an environmental change. For example, applying antibiotics to a population of bacteria will, over time,\nselect a population of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. The resistance, which is caused by a gene, did not arise by\nmutation because of the application of the antibiotic. The gene for resistance was already present in the gene pool of the\nbacteria, likely at a low frequency. The antibiotic, which kills the bacterial cells without the resistance gene, strongly selects\nindividuals that are resistant, since these would be the only ones that survived and divided. Experiments have demonstrated\nthat mutations for antibiotic resistance do not arise as a result of antibiotic.\nIn a larger sense, evolution is not goal directed. Species do not become \u201cbetter\u201d over time; they simply track their changing\nenvironment with adaptations that maximize their reproduction in a particular environment at a particular time. Evolution\nhas no goal of making faster, bigger, more complex, or even smarter species, despite the commonness of this kind of\nlanguage in popular discourse. What characteristics evolve in a species are a function of the variation present and the\nenvironment, both of which are constantly changing in a non-directional way. What trait is fit in one environment at one\ntime may well be fatal at some point in the future. This holds equally well for a species of insect as it does the human\nspecies.\n730\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nActivity\nUsing information from a book or online resource such as Jonathan Weiner\u2019s The Beak of the Finch, explain\nhow contemporary evidence drawn from multiple scientific disciplines supports the observations of Charles\nDarwin regarding evolution by natural selection.

        "summary": "The \u201cUnderstanding Evolution\u201d section explains evolution as the central unifying theory of biology, describing how all life descends from a common ancestor and changes over time through mechanisms such as natural selection. Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace independently proposed natural selection as the process by which individuals with heritable traits better suited to their environment leave more offspring, leading to adaptation and changes in populations over generations. Variation arises through mutation and sexual reproduction, and traits may be advantageous, neutral, or disadvantageous depending on environmental conditions, with examples given for divergent and convergent evolution. Multiple lines of evidence\u2014fossils, homologous and vestigial structures, embryology, biogeography, molecular biology, and direct observations like antibiotic resistance\u2014support the theory. The section also addresses misconceptions, clarifying that evolution acts on populations rather than individuals, does not explain the origin of life, is not goal-directed, and is a well-supported scientific theory rather than a mere guess."

One form of sympatric speciation begins with a serious chromosomal error during cell division. As you recall from our\nexploration of meiosis, sometimes errors occur in the separation of chromosomes or chromatids, resulting in gametes with\nextra chromosomes (polyploidy). This type of speciation is more common in plants than in animals, though some examples\nin animals exist. For example, two groups of cichlid fish in Africa\u2019s Lake Victoria, which have distinct morphologies and\ndiets, may be in the early stage of sympatric speciation without polyploidy, as genetic differences arise between the two\ngroups.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in this section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 1 and Big Idea\n3 of the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework.

According to this\ndefinition, one species is distinguished from another when, in nature, it is not possible for matings between individuals from\neach species to produce fertile offspring.\nMembers of the same species share both external and internal characteristics, which develop from their DNA. The closer\nrelationship two organisms share, the more DNA they have in common, just like people and their families. People\u2019s DNA\nis likely to be more like their father or mother\u2019s DNA than their cousin or grandparent\u2019s DNA. Organisms of the same\nspecies have the highest level of DNA alignment and therefore share characteristics and behaviors that lead to successful\nreproduction.\nSpecies\u2019 appearance can be misleading in suggesting an ability or inability to mate. For example, even though domestic\ndogs (Canis lupus familiaris) display phenotypic differences, such as size, build, and coat, most dogs can interbreed and\nproduce viable puppies that can mature and sexually reproduce (Figure 18.10).\nFigure 18.10 The (a) poodle and (b) cocker spaniel can reproduce to produce a breed known as (c) the cockapoo.\n(credit a: modification of work by Sally Eller, Tom Reese; credit b: modification of work by Jeremy McWilliams; credit c:\nmodification of work by Kathleen Conklin)\nIn other cases, individuals may appear similar although they are not members of the same species. For example, even though\nbald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer) are both birds and eagles, each belongs\nto a separate species group (Figure 18.11). If humans were to artificially intervene and fertilize the egg of a bald eagle with\nthe sperm of an African fish eagle and a chick did hatch, that offspring, called a hybrid (a cross between two species), would\nprobably be infertile\u2014unable to successfully reproduce after it reached maturity. Different species may have different genes\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\n733\nthat are active in development; therefore, it may not be possible to develop a viable offspring with two different sets of\ndirections. Thus, even though hybridization may take place, the two species still remain separate.\nFigure 18.11 The (a) African fish eagle is similar in appearance to the (b) bald eagle, but the two birds are members of\ndifferent species. (credit a: modification of work by Nigel Wedge; credit b: modification of work by U.S. Fish and Wildlife\nService)\nPopulations of species share a gene pool: a collection of all the variants of genes in the species. Again, the basis to\nany changes in a group or population of organisms must be genetic for this is the only way to share and pass on traits.\nWhen variations occur within a species, they can only be passed to the next generation along two main pathways: asexual\nreproduction or sexual reproduction. The change will be passed on asexually simply if the reproducing cell possesses\nthe changed trait. For the changed trait to be passed on by sexual reproduction, a gamete, such as a sperm or egg cell,\nmust possess the changed trait. In other words, sexually-reproducing organisms can experience several genetic changes\nin their body cells, but if these changes do not occur in a sperm or egg cell, the changed trait will never reach the next\ngeneration. Only heritable traits can evolve. Therefore, reproduction plays a paramount role for genetic change to take root\nin a population or species. In short, organisms must be able to reproduce with each other to pass new traits to offspring.\nUntil recently, these three species of short-tailed pythons, Python curtus, Python brongersmai (middle), and\nPython breitensteini were considered one species. However, due to the different locations in which they are\nfound, they have become three distinct species.\nFigure 18.12\nUntil recently, these three species of short-tailed pythons, Python curtus, Python brongersmai (middle), and Python\nbreitensteini were considered one species.

There are exceptions to this rule. Many species are similar enough that hybrid offspring are\npossible and may often occur in nature, but for the majority of species this rule generally holds. In fact, the presence in\nnature of hybrids between similar species suggests that they may have descended from a single interbreeding species, and\nthe speciation process may not yet be complete.\nGiven the extraordinary diversity of life on the planet there must be mechanisms for speciation: the formation of two\nspecies from one original species. Darwin envisioned this process as a branching event and diagrammed the process in the\nonly illustration found in On the Origin of Species (Figure 18.13a). Compare this illustration to the diagram of elephant\nevolution (Figure 18.13b), which shows that as one species changes over time, it branches to form more than one new\nspecies, repeatedly, as long as the population survives or until the organism becomes extinct.\nFigure 18.13 The only illustration in Darwin's On the Origin of Species is (a) a diagram showing speciation events\nleading to biological diversity. The diagram shows similarities to phylogenetic charts that are drawn today to illustrate\nthe relationships of species. (b) Modern elephants evolved from the Palaeomastodon, a species that lived in Egypt\n35\u201350 million years ago.\nFor speciation to occur, two new populations must be formed from one original population and they must evolve in such\na way that it becomes impossible for individuals from the two new populations to interbreed. Biologists have proposed\nmechanisms by which this could occur that fall into two broad categories. Allopatric speciation (allo- = \"other\"; -patric\n= \"homeland\") involves geographic separation of populations from a parent species and subsequent evolution. Sympatric\nspeciation (sym- = \"same\"; -patric = \"homeland\") involves speciation occurring within a parent species remaining in one\nlocation.\nBiologists think of speciation events as the splitting of one ancestral species into two descendant species. There is no reason\nwhy there might not be more than two species formed at one time except that it is less likely and multiple events can be\nconceptualized as single splits occurring close in time.\nAllopatric Speciation\nA geographically continuous population has a gene pool that is relatively homogeneous. Gene flow, the movement of alleles\nacross the range of the species, is relatively free because individuals can move and then mate with individuals in their new\nlocation. Thus, the frequency of an allele at one end of a distribution will be similar to the frequency of the allele at the other\nend. When populations become geographically discontinuous, that free-flow of alleles is prevented. When that separation\nlasts for a period of time, the two populations are able to evolve along different trajectories. Thus, their allele frequencies\nat numerous genetic loci gradually become more and more different as new alleles independently arise by mutation in\neach population. Typically, environmental conditions, such as climate, resources, predators, and competitors for the two\npopulations will differ causing natural selection to favor divergent adaptations in each group.\nIsolation of populations leading to allopatric speciation can occur in a variety of ways: a river forming a new branch, erosion\nforming a new valley, a group of organisms traveling to a new location without the ability to return, or seeds floating\nover the ocean to an island. The nature of the geographic separation necessary to isolate populations depends entirely on\nthe biology of the organism and its potential for dispersal. If two flying insect populations took up residence in separate\nnearby valleys, chances are, individuals from each population would fly back and forth continuing gene flow. However, if\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\n735\ntwo rodent populations became divided by the formation of a new lake, continued gene flow would be unlikely; therefore,\nspeciation would be more likely.\nBiologists group allopatric processes into two categories: dispersal and vicariance. Dispersal is when a few members of a\nspecies move to a new geographical area, and vicariance is when a natural situation arises to physically divide organisms.\nScientists have documented numerous cases of allopatric speciation taking place. For example, along the west coast of\nthe United States, two separate sub-species of spotted owls exist. The northern spotted owl has genetic and phenotypic\ndifferences from its close relative: the Mexican spotted owl, which lives in the south (Figure 18.14).\nFigure 18.14 The northern spotted owl and the Mexican spotted owl inhabit geographically separate locations with\ndifferent climates and ecosystems. The owl is an example of allopatric speciation. (credit \"northern spotted owl\":\nmodification of work by John and Karen Hollingsworth; credit \"Mexican spotted owl\": modification of work by Bill Radke)\nAdditionally, scientists have found that the farther the distance between two groups that once were the same species, the\nmore likely it is that speciation will occur. This seems logical because as the distance increases, the various environmental\nfactors would likely have less in common than locations in close proximity. Consider the two owls: in the north, the climate\nis cooler than in the south; the types of organisms in each ecosystem differ, as do their behaviors and habits; also, the hunting\nhabits and prey choices of the southern owls vary from the northern owls. These variances can lead to evolved differences\nin the owls, and speciation likely will occur.\nAdaptive Radiation\nIn some cases, a population of one species disperses throughout an area, and each population finds a distinct niche or\nisolated habitat. Over time, the varied demands of their new lifestyles lead to multiple speciation events originating from a\nsingle species. This is called adaptive radiation because many adaptations evolve from a single point of origin; thus, causing\nthe species to radiate into several new ones. Island archipelagos like the Hawaiian Islands provide an ideal context for\nadaptive radiation events because water surrounds each island which leads to geographical isolation for many organisms.\nThe Hawaiian honeycreeper illustrates one example of adaptive radiation. From a single species, called the founder species,\nnumerous species have evolved, including the six shown in Figure 18.15.\n736\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 18.15 The honeycreeper birds illustrate adaptive radiation. From one original species of bird, multiple others\nevolved, each with its own distinctive characteristics.\nNotice the differences in the species\u2019 beaks in Figure 18.15. Evolution in response to natural selection based on specific\nfood sources in each new habitat led to evolution of a different beak suited to the specific food source. The seed-eating bird\nhas a thicker, stronger beak which is suited to break hard nuts. The nectar-eating birds have long beaks to dip into flowers\nto reach the nectar. The insect-eating birds have beaks like swords, appropriate for stabbing and impaling insects. Darwin\u2019s\nfinches are another example of adaptive radiation in an archipelago.\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\n737\nClick through this interactive site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/bird_evolution) to see how island birds evolved in\nevolutionary increments from 5 million years ago to today.\nName three examples of adaptive radiation, and provide a brief statement about each one.\na.\nDomestic dogs \u2013 There are over 300 distinct dog breeds.

Madagascar lemurs-\nTheir common ancestor likely arrived to Madagascar over 60 million years ago. Hawaiian fruit fly-There are\n500 species of fruit fly from one parent species.\nd.\nBeetles \u2013 There are about 350,000 species of beetles that we know of. Birds \u2013 There are almost 10,000\nspecies of birds in existence. Frogs \u2013 There are almost 5,000 species of frogs worldwide.\nSympatric Speciation\nCan divergence occur if no physical barriers are in place to separate individuals who continue to live and reproduce in\nthe same habitat? The answer is yes. The process of speciation within the same space is called sympatric speciation; the\nprefix \u201csym\u201d means same, so \u201csympatric\u201d means \u201csame homeland\u201d in contrast to \u201callopatric\u201d meaning \u201cother homeland.\u201d\nA number of mechanisms for sympatric speciation have been proposed and studied.\nOne form of sympatric speciation can begin with a serious chromosomal error during cell division. In a normal cell division\nevent chromosomes replicate, pair up, and then separate so that each new cell has the same number of chromosomes.\nHowever, sometimes the pairs separate and the end cell product has too many or too few individual chromosomes in a\ncondition called aneuploidy (Figure 18.16).\n738\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 18.16 Aneuploidy results when the gametes have too many or too few chromosomes due to nondisjunction\nduring meiosis. In the example shown here, the resulting offspring will have 2n+1 or 2n-1 chromosomes\nIn your own words, define aneuploidy.\na.\nAneuploidy is a mutation that causes the genome of a cell to break down.\nb.\nneuploidy is the condition of having too many or too few chromosomes as a result of an error during cell\ndivision\nc.\nAneuploidy is the condition of having an extra copy of every chromosome in the genome.\nd.\nAneuploidy is a prezygotic barrier in which the gametes of two distinct species will not fertilize each other.\nPolyploidy is a condition in which a cell or organism has an extra set, or sets, of chromosomes. Scientists have identified\ntwo main types of polyploidy that can lead to reproductive isolation of an individual in the polyploidy state. Reproductive\nisolation is the inability to interbreed. In some cases, a polyploid individual will have two or more complete sets of\nchromosomes from its own species in a condition called autopolyploidy (Figure 18.17). The prefix \u201cauto-\u201d means \u201cself,\u201d\nso the term means multiple chromosomes from one\u2019s own species. Polyploidy results from an error in meiosis in which all\nof the chromosomes move into one cell instead of separating.\nFigure 18.17 Autopolyploidy results when mitosis is not followed by cytokinesis.\nFor example, if a plant species with 2n = 6 produces autopolyploid gametes that are also diploid (2n = 6, when they should\nbe n = 3), the gametes now have twice as many chromosomes as they should have. These new gametes will be incompatible\nwith the normal gametes produced by this plant species. However, they could either self-pollinate or reproduce with other\nautopolyploid plants with gametes having the same diploid number. In this way, sympatric speciation can occur quickly by\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\n739\nforming offspring with 4n called a tetraploid. These individuals would immediately be able to reproduce only with those of\nthis new kind and not those of the ancestral species.\nThe other form of polyploidy occurs when individuals of two different species reproduce to form a viable offspring called\nan allopolyploid. The prefix \u201callo-\u201d means \u201cother\u201d (recall from allopatric): therefore, an allopolyploid occurs when gametes\nfrom two different species combine. Figure 18.18 illustrates one possible way an allopolyploid can form. Notice how it\ntakes two generations, or two reproductive acts, before the viable fertile hybrid results.\nFigure 18.18 Alloploidy results when two species mate to produce viable offspring. In the example shown, a normal\ngamete from one species fuses with a polyploidy gamete from another. Two matings are necessary to produce viable\noffspring.\nThe cultivated forms of wheat, cotton, and tobacco plants are all allopolyploids. Although polyploidy occurs occasionally\nin animals, it takes place most commonly in plants. (Animals with any of the types of chromosomal aberrations described\nhere are unlikely to survive and produce normal offspring.) Scientists have discovered more than half of all plant species\nstudied relate back to a species evolved through polyploidy. With such a high rate of polyploidy in plants, some scientists\nhypothesize that this mechanism takes place more as an adaptation than as an error.\nActivity\nCreate a visual representation such as a diagram with annotation to explain how island chains provide ideal\nconditions for allopatric speciation and adaptive radiation to occur. Then design a plan for collecting data to\nsupport the claim that speciation has occurred.\nThink About It\n\u2022\nTwo species of fish had recently undergone sympatric speciation. The males of each species had a different\ncoloring through which the females could identify and choose a partner from her own species. After some time,\npollution made the lake so cloudy that it was hard for females to distinguish colors. What might take place in this\nsituation?\n\u2022\nIn a lake where most fish of a single species exhibit colorful stripes, a few individual animals have muted colors.\nThe local fisherman receives a large order to catch the most colorful fish for a local aquarium store. The fisherman\ncasts wide nets across the lake to catch a large number of the fish. He then keeps the colorful fish for the aquarium\nand throws back the dull colored fish. How will this single event change the make-up of the fish population?\nReproductive Isolation\nGiven enough time, the genetic and phenotypic divergence between populations will affect characters that influence\nreproduction: if individuals of the two populations were to be brought together, mating would be less likely, but if mating\n740\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\noccurred, offspring would be non-viable or infertile. Many types of diverging characters may affect the reproductive\nisolation (the inability to interbreed) of the two populations.\nReproductive isolation can take place in a variety of ways. Scientists organize them into two groups: prezygotic barriers and\npostzygotic barriers. Recall that a zygote is a fertilized egg: the first cell of the development of an organism that reproduces\nsexually. Therefore, a prezygotic barrier is a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place; this includes barriers\nthat prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction. A postzygotic barrier occurs after zygote formation; this\nincludes organisms that don\u2019t survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile.\nSome types of prezygotic barriers prevent reproduction entirely. Many organisms only reproduce at certain times of the\nyear, often just annually. Differences in breeding schedules, called temporal isolation, can act as a form of reproductive\nisolation. For example, two species of frogs inhabit the same area, but one reproduces from January to March, whereas the\nother reproduces from March to May (Figure 18.19).\nFigure 18.19 These two related frog species exhibit temporal reproductive isolation. (a) Rana aurora breeds earlier in\nthe year than (b) Rana boylii. (credit a: modification of work by Mark R. Jennings, USFWS; credit b: modification of\nwork by Alessandro Catenazzi)\nIn some cases, populations of a species move or are moved to a new habitat and take up residence in a place that no longer\noverlaps with the other populations of the same species. This situation is called habitat isolation. Reproduction with the\nparent species ceases, and a new group exists that is now reproductively and genetically independent. For example, a cricket\npopulation that was divided after a flood could no longer interact with each other. Over time, the forces of natural selection,\nmutation, and genetic drift will likely result in the divergence of the two groups (Figure 18.20).\nFigure 18.20 Speciation can occur when two populations occupy different habitats. The habitats need not be far apart.\nThe cricket (a) Gryllus pennsylvanicus prefers sandy soil, and the cricket (b) Gryllus firmus prefers loamy soil. The two\nspecies can live in close proximity, but because of their different soil preferences, they became genetically isolated.\nBehavioral isolation occurs when the presence or absence of a specific behavior prevents reproduction from taking place.\nFor example, male fireflies use specific light patterns to attract females. Various species of fireflies display their lights\ndifferently. If a male of one species tried to attract the female of another, she would not recognize the light pattern and would\nnot mate with the male.\nOther prezygotic barriers work when differences in their gamete cells (eggs and sperm) prevent fertilization from taking\nplace; this is called a gametic barrier. Similarly, in some cases closely related organisms try to mate, but their reproductive\nstructures simply do not fit together. For example, damselfly males and females of different species have differently shaped\nreproductive organs. If one species tries to mate with another, their body parts simply do not fit together. (Figure 18.21).\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\n741\nFigure 18.21 The shape of the male reproductive organ varies among male damselfly species, and is only compatible\nwith the female of the same species. Reproductive organ incompatibility keeps each species reproductively isolated.\nIn plants, certain structures aimed to attract one type of pollinator simultaneously prevent a different pollinator from\naccessing the pollen. The tunnel through which an animal must access nectar can vary widely in length and diameter, which\nprevents the plant from being cross-pollinated with a different species (Figure 18.22).\nFigure 18.22 Some flowers have evolved to attract certain pollinators. The (a) wide foxglove flower is adapted for\npollination by bees, while the (b) long, tube-shaped trumpet creeper flower is adapted for pollination by hummingbirds.\nWhen fertilization takes place and a zygote forms, postzygotic barriers can prevent reproduction. Hybrid individuals in\nmany cases cannot form normally in the womb and simply do not survive past the embryonic stages. This is called hybrid\ninviability because the hybrid organisms simply are not viable. In another postzygotic situation, reproduction leads to the\nbirth and growth of a hybrid that is sterile and unable to reproduce offspring of their own; this is called hybrid sterility.\nHabitat Influence on Speciation\nSympatric speciation may also take place in ways other than polyploidy. For example, consider a species of fish that lives in\na lake. As the population grows, competition for food also grows. Under pressure to find food, suppose that a group of these\nfish had the genetic flexibility to discover and feed off another resource that was unused by the other fish. What if this new\nfood source was found at a different depth of the lake? Over time, those feeding on the second food source would interact\nmore with each other than the other fish; therefore, they would breed together as well. Offspring of these fish would likely\nbehave as their parents: feeding and living in the same area and keeping separate from the original population. If this group\nof fish continued to remain separate from the first population, eventually sympatric speciation might occur as more genetic\ndifferences accumulated between them.\nThis scenario does play out in nature, as do others that lead to reproductive isolation. One such place is Lake Victoria in\nAfrica, famous for its sympatric speciation of cichlid fish. Researchers have found hundreds of sympatric speciation events\nin these fish, which have not only happened in great number, but also over a short period of time. Figure 18.23 shows\nthis type of speciation among a cichlid fish population in Nicaragua. In this locale, two types of cichlids live in the same\ngeographic location but have come to have different morphologies that allow them to eat various food sources.\nFigure 18.23 Cichlid fish from Lake Apoyeque, Nicaragua, show evidence of sympatric speciation. Lake Apoyeque,\na crater lake, is 1800 years old, but genetic evidence indicates that the lake was populated only 100 years ago by a\nsingle population of cichlid fish. Nevertheless, two populations with distinct morphologies and diets now exist in the\nlake, and scientists believe these populations may be in an early stage of speciation.\n742\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\n18.3 | Reconnection and Rates of Speciation\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the pathways of species evolution in hybrid zones?\n\u2022\nWhat are the two major theories on rates of speciation?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nSpeciation can both occur gradually over time in small steps or in bursts of change known as punctuated equilibrium.\nWith punctuated equilibrium, a species may remain unchanged for long periods of time.

        "summary": "The formation of new species, or speciation, occurs when populations of the same species diverge to the point where they can no longer interbreed and produce fertile offspring. This can happen through allopatric speciation, in which geographic separation blocks gene flow and populations evolve independently under different selective pressures, or through sympatric speciation, which occurs within a shared habitat, often due to genetic changes such as polyploidy, especially in plants, or ecological and behavioral divergence. Adaptive radiation, in which one ancestral species evolves into many species adapted to different niches, can arise in isolated environments like islands. Reproductive isolation, essential for maintaining separate species, can occur before fertilization (prezygotic barriers such as differences in mating seasons, behaviors, habitats, or reproductive structures) or after fertilization (postzygotic barriers such as hybrid inviability or sterility). Examples in nature include Darwin\u2019s finches, Hawaiian honeycreepers, and cichlid fish, which illustrate how genetic variation, isolation, and adaptation to environmental differences contribute to the emergence of new species."

Individual organisms will mate\nwith any nearby individual who they are capable of breeding with. An area where two closely related species continue to\ninteract and reproduce, forming hybrids, is called a hybrid zone. Over time, the hybrid zone may change depending on the\nfitness of the hybrids and the reproductive barriers (Figure 18.24). If the hybrids are less fit than the parents, reinforcement\nof speciation occurs, and the species continue to diverge until they can no longer mate and produce viable offspring. If\nreproductive barriers weaken, fusion occurs and the two species become one. Barriers remain the same if hybrids are fit and\nreproductive: stability may occur and hybridization continues.\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\n743\nFigure 18.24 After speciation has occurred, the two separate but closely related species may continue to\nproduce offspring in an area called the hybrid zone. Reinforcement, fusion, or stability may result, depending on\nreproductive barriers and the relative fitness of the hybrids.\nWhat are three different pathways that species evolution may take in hybrid zones?\na.\nstability, fusion, reinforcement\nb.\nallopatric speciation, sympatric speciation, fusion\nc.\nconvergent evolution, divergent evolution, no evolution\nd.\nnatural selection, genetic drift, gene flow\nHybrids can be either less fit than the parents, more fit, or about the same. Usually hybrids tend to be less fit; therefore, such\nreproduction diminishes over time, nudging the two species to diverge further in a process called reinforcement. This term\nis used because the low success of the hybrids reinforces the original speciation. If the hybrids are as fit or more fit than the\nparents, the two species may fuse back into one species (Figure 18.25). Scientists have also observed that sometimes two\nspecies will remain separate but also continue to interact to produce some hybrid individuals; this is classified as stability\nbecause no real net change is taking place.\nVarying Rates of Speciation\nScientists around the world study speciation, documenting observations both of living organisms and those found in the\nfossil record. As their ideas take shape and as research reveals new details about how life evolves, they develop models\nto help explain rates of speciation. In terms of how quickly speciation occurs, two patterns are currently observed: gradual\nspeciation model and punctuated equilibrium model.\nIn the gradual speciation model, species diverge gradually over time in small steps. In the punctuated equilibrium\nmodel, a new species undergoes changes quickly from the parent species, and then remains largely unchanged for long\nperiods of time afterward (Figure 18.25). This early change model is called punctuated equilibrium, because it begins with\na punctuated or periodic change and then remains in balance afterward. While punctuated equilibrium suggests a faster\ntempo, it does not necessarily exclude gradualism.\n744\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 18.25 In (a) gradual speciation, species diverge at a slow, steady pace as traits change incrementally.

Under some conditions, selection\noccurs quickly or radically. Consider a species of snails that had been living with the same basic form for many thousands\nof years. Layers of their fossils would appear similar for a long time. When a change in the environment takes place\u2014such\nas a drop in the water level\u2014a small number of organisms are separated from the rest in a brief period of time, essentially\nforming one large and one tiny population. The tiny population faces new environmental conditions. Because its gene pool\nquickly became so small, any variation that surfaces and that aids in surviving the new conditions becomes the predominant\nform.\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\n745\nVisit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/snails) to continue the speciation story of the snails.\n746\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nacquired characteristics\nadaptation\nadaptive radiation\nallopatric speciation\nallopolyploid\naneuploidy\nautopolyploid\nbehavioral isolation\nconvergent evolution\ndispersal\ndivergent evolution\ngametic barrier\ngradual speciation model\nhabitat isolation\nhomologous structures\nhybrid\nhybrid zone\nnatural selection\npolyploidy\npostzygotic barrier\nprezygotic barrier\npunctuated equilibrium\nreinforcement\nreproductive isolation\nspeciation\nspecies\nsympatric speciation\ntemporal isolation\nKEY TERMS\nmodifications caused by an individual\u2019s environment that can be inherited by its offspring\nheritable trait or behavior in an organism that aids in its survival and reproduction in its present environment\nspeciation when one species radiates out to form several other species\nspeciation that occurs via geographic separation\npolyploidy formed between two related, but separate species\ncondition of a cell having an extra chromosome or missing a chromosome for its species\npolyploidy formed within a single species\ntype of reproductive isolation that occurs when a specific behavior or lack of one prevents\nreproduction from taking place\nprocess by which groups of organisms independently evolve to similar forms\nallopatric speciation that occurs when a few members of a species move to a new geographical area\nprocess by which groups of organisms evolve in diverse directions from a common point\nprezygotic barrier occurring when closely related individuals of different species mate, but differences in\ntheir gamete cells (eggs and sperm) prevent fertilization from taking place\nmodel that shows how species diverge gradually over time in small steps\nreproductive isolation resulting when populations of a species move or are moved to a new habitat,\ntaking up residence in a place that no longer overlaps with the other populations of the same species\nparallel structures in diverse organisms that have a common ancestor\noffspring of two closely related individuals, not of the same species\narea where two closely related species continue to interact and reproduce, forming hybrids\nreproduction of individuals with favorable genetic traits that survive environmental change because of\nthose traits, leading to evolutionary change\ngametes with extra chromosomes\nreproductive isolation mechanism that occurs after zygote formation\nreproductive isolation mechanism that occurs before zygote formation\nmodel for rapid speciation that can occur when an event causes a small portion of a population\nto be cut off from the rest of the population\ncontinued speciation divergence between two related species due to low fitness of hybrids between them\nsituation that occurs when a species is reproductively independent from other species; this may\nbe brought about by behavior, location, or reproductive barriers\nformation of a new species\ngroup of populations that interbreed and produce fertile offspring\nspeciation that occurs in the same geographic space\ndifferences in breeding schedules that can act as a form of prezygotic barrier leading to reproductive\nChapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species\n747\ntheory of evolution\nvariation\nvestigial structure\nvicariance\nisolation\nexplains how populations change over time and how life diversifies the origin of species\ngenetic differences among individuals in a population\nphysical structure present in an organism but that has no apparent function and appears to be from a\nfunctional structure in a distant ancestor\nallopatric speciation that occurs when something in the environment separates organisms of the same species\ninto separate groups",
        "summary": "After speciation, closely related species may continue to interact in hybrid zones, where they can produce hybrid offspring. The evolutionary outcomes in such zones depend on hybrid fitness and the strength of reproductive barriers: reinforcement occurs if hybrids are less fit, leading to increased divergence; fusion happens if hybrids are equally or more fit, causing the species to merge; and stability results when hybrids are viable, but species remain distinct while continuing hybridization. Regarding the rates of speciation, scientists identify two main models: the gradual speciation model, in which divergence occurs slowly through small incremental changes, and the punctuated equilibrium model, where rapid divergence is followed by long periods of stability. Environmental change is a key factor influencing speciation rate, with sudden, significant changes\u2014such as habitat fragmentation\u2014often driving faster evolutionary shifts, particularly in small, isolated populations where advantageous traits can quickly become dominant."

Rather than just seeking\nanswers to how illness occurs, evolutionary medicine also asks why illness occurs. This approach to medicine has led to\nmany important advances. For example, endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are pieces of retroviruses that began invading\nmammalian genomes over 100 million years ago. While studying why smaller mammals tend to get cancer more frequently\nthan larger mammals, scientists discovered that larger mammals have had fewer ERVs invade their genome. Because\nretroviral integration is associated with cancer, results from this research suggest the possibility that larger mammals are\nable to control EVR replication until they reach post-reproductive age.\n[1] More on this research can be found on the PLOS\nPathogens website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32mammalcancer) .\n1.

This lack of understanding was a stumbling block to understanding many\naspects of evolution. In fact, the predominant (and incorrect) genetic theory of the time, blending inheritance, made it\ndifficult to understand how natural selection might operate. Darwin and Wallace were unaware of the genetics work by\nAustrian monk Gregor Mendel, which was published in 1866, not long after publication of Darwin's book, On the Origin\nof Species. Mendel\u2019s work was rediscovered in the early twentieth century at which time geneticists were rapidly coming\nto an understanding of the basics of inheritance. Initially, the newly discovered particulate nature of genes made it difficult\nfor biologists to understand how gradual evolution could occur. But over the next few decades genetics and evolution were\nintegrated in what became known as the modern synthesis\u2014the coherent understanding of the relationship between natural\nselection and genetics that took shape by the 1940s and is generally accepted today. In sum, the modern synthesis describes\nhow evolutionary processes, such as natural selection, can affect a population\u2019s genetic makeup, and, in turn, how this can\nresult in the gradual evolution of populations and species. The theory also connects this change of a population over time,\ncalled microevolution, with the processes that gave rise to new species and higher taxonomic groups with widely divergent\ncharacters, called macroevolution.\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nPopulation genetics studies microevolution by measuring changes in a population\u2019s allele frequencies over time.\n(Remember that we studied genotypes and allele frequencies when we explored inheritance patterns proposed by Mendel.)\nFor example, scientists examining allele frequencies in a pesticide resistance gene in mosquitoes at Equatorial Guinea found\nthat the frequency of one resistance allele was 6.3%, while a second resistance allele\u2019s frequency was 74.6%, and the non-\nresistance allele\u2019s frequency was 19.0%. These three frequencies add up to 100%.\n[2] A population\u2019s gene pool is the sum of\nall the alleles. If these frequencies do not change over time, the population is said to be in Hardy\u2013Weinberg principle of\nequilibrium\u2014a stable, non-evolving state. However, if a phenotype is favored by natural selection, allele frequencies can\nchange. If this is the case, the population is evolving. Sometimes allele frequencies within a population change randomly\nwith no advantage to the population over existing allele frequencies. This phenomenon is called genetic drift. An event that\ninitiates an allele frequency change in an isolated part of the population, which is not typical of the original population, is\ncalled the founder effect. In Population Genetics, we will explore how natural selection, random drift, and founder effects\ncan lead to significant changes in the genome of a population.\nHardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium reflects a state of constancy in a population\u2019s gene pool. In other words, allele frequencies\nremain stable from generation to generation if certain conditions are met: no mutations, no gene flow, random mating,\nno genetic drift, and no selection. Because these conditions are rarely met, allele frequencies are typically changing,\nreflecting evolution. The Hardy\u2013Weinberg principle is represented by the mathematical equation p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1,\nwhere p represents the frequency of the dominant allele and q represents the frequency of the recessive allele. Deviations\nfrom Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium allow us to measure microevolutionary shifts in a population when one or more of the\nHardy\u2013Weinberg parameters change. For example, if we go back to the study of the frequencies of alleles in a pesticide\nresistance gene, after an area was treated with pesticides for two years, the resistance alleles increased to 11.1% and 83.3%,\nrespectively, while the non-resistance allele decreased to 5.6%. This indicates that microevolution was occurring.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 1 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework.

Scientists, health experts,\nand institutions determine recommendations for different parts of the population, predict optimal production\nand inoculation schedules, create vaccines, and set up clinics to provide inoculations. You may think of the\nannual flu shot as a lot of media hype, an important health protection, or just a briefly uncomfortable prick in\nyour arm. But do you think of it in terms of evolution?\nThe media hype of annual flu shots is scientifically grounded in our understanding of evolution. Each year,\nscientists across the globe strive to predict the flu strains that they anticipate being most widespread and\nharmful in the coming year. This knowledge is based in how flu strains have evolved over time and over\nthe past few flu seasons. Scientists then work to create the most effective vaccine to combat those selected\nstrains. Hundreds of millions of doses are produced in a short period in order to provide vaccinations to key\npopulations at the optimal time.\nBecause viruses, like the flu, evolve very quickly (especially in evolutionary time), this poses quite a\nchallenge. Viruses mutate and replicate at a fast rate, so the vaccine developed to protect against last year\u2019s\nflu strain may not provide the protection needed against the coming year\u2019s strain. Evolution of these viruses\nmeans continued adaptions to ensure survival, including adaptations to survive previous vaccines.\nPopulation genetics is the study of what?\na.\nHow selective forces change the allele frequencies in a population over time.\nb.\nThe genetic basis of genetic traits within individuals.\nc.\nWhether traits have a genetic basis.\nd.\nThe degree of inbreeding in a population.\nPopulation Genetics\nRecall that a gene for a particular character may have several alleles, or variants, that code for different traits associated\nwith that character. For example, in the ABO blood type system in humans, three alleles determine the particular blood-type\nprotein on the surface of red blood cells. Each individual in a population of diploid organisms can only carry two alleles\nfor a particular gene, but more than two may be present in the individuals that make up the population. Mendel followed\nalleles as they were inherited from parent to offspring. In the early twentieth century, biologists in a field of study known\nas population genetics began to study how selective forces change a population through changes in allele and genotypic\nfrequencies.\nThe allele frequency (or gene frequency) is the proportion of a specific allele within a population, relative to all other alleles\nof that gene that are present in the population. Until now we have discussed evolution as a change in the characteristics of\na population of organisms, but behind that phenotypic change is genetic change. In population genetics, the term evolution\nis defined as a change in the frequency of an allele in a population. Using the ABO blood type system as an example, the\nfrequency of one of the alleles, IA, is the number of copies of that allele divided by all the copies of the ABO gene in the\npopulation. For example, a study in Jordan\n[3] found a frequency of IA to be 26.1 percent. The IB and I0 alleles made up 13.4\npercent and 60.5 percent of the alleles respectively, and all of the frequencies added up to 100 percent. A change in this\nfrequency over time would constitute evolution in the population.\nThe allele frequency within a given population can change depending on environmental factors; therefore, certain alleles\nbecome more widespread than others during the process of natural selection. Natural selection can alter the population\u2019s\ngenetic makeup; for example, if a given allele confers a phenotype that allows an individual to better survive or have more\noffspring. Because many of those offspring will also carry the beneficial allele, and often the corresponding phenotype,\nthey will have more offspring of their own that also carry the allele, thus, perpetuating the cycle. Over time, the allele will\nspread throughout the population. Some alleles will quickly become fixed in this way, meaning that every individual of the\npopulation will carry the allele, while detrimental mutations may be swiftly eliminated if derived from a dominant allele\nfrom the gene pool. The gene pool is the sum of all the alleles in a population.\n3. Sahar S. Hanania, Dhia S. Hassawi, and Nidal M. Irshaid, \u201cAllele Frequency and Molecular Genotypes of ABO Blood Group System in a Jordanian\nPopulation,\u201d Journal of Medical Sciences 7 (2007): 51-58, doi:10.3923/jms.2007.51.58.\n770\nChapter 19 | The Evolution of Populations\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nSometimes, allele frequencies within a population change randomly with no advantage to the population over existing allele\nfrequencies. This phenomenon is called genetic drift. Natural selection and genetic drift usually occur simultaneously in\npopulations and are not isolated events. It is hard to determine which process dominates because it is often nearly impossible\nto determine the cause of change in allele frequencies at each occurrence. An event that initiates an allele frequency change\nin an isolated part of the population, which is not typical of the original population, is called the founder effect. Natural\nselection, random drift, and founder effects can lead to significant changes in the genome of a population.\nHardy\u2013Weinberg Principle of Equilibrium\nIn the early twentieth century, English mathematician Godfrey Hardy and German physician Wilhelm Weinberg stated\nthe principle of equilibrium to describe the genetic makeup of a population. The theory, which later became known as\nthe Hardy\u2013Weinberg principle of equilibrium, states that a population\u2019s allele and genotype frequencies are inherently\nstable\u2014unless some kind of evolutionary force is acting upon the population, neither the allele nor the genotypic\nfrequencies would change. The Hardy\u2013Weinberg principle assumes conditions with no mutations, migration, emigration, or\nselective pressure for or against genotype, plus an infinite population; while no population can satisfy those conditions, the\nprinciple offers a useful model against which to compare real population changes.\nWorking under this theory, population geneticists represent different alleles as different variables in their mathematical\nmodels. The variable p, for example, typically represents the frequency of the dominant allele, say Y for the trait of yellow\nin Mendel's peas. The variable q represents the frequency of the recessive allele, in this case y, that confers the color green.\nIf these are the only two possible alleles for a given locus in the population, p + q = 1. In other words, all the p alleles and\nall the q alleles make up all of the alleles for that locus that are found in the population.\nBut what ultimately interests most biologists is not the frequencies of different alleles, but the frequencies of the resulting\ngenotypes, known as the population\u2019s genetic structure, from which scientists can surmise the distribution of phenotypes.\nIf the phenotype is observed, only the genotype of the homozygous recessive alleles can be known; the calculations provide\nan estimate of the remaining genotypes. Since each individual carries two alleles per gene, if the allele frequencies (p and q)\nare known, predicting the frequencies of these genotypes is a simple mathematical calculation to determine the probability\nof getting these genotypes if two alleles are drawn at random from the gene pool. So in the above scenario, an individual\npea plant could be pp (YY), and thus produce yellow peas; pq (Yy), also yellow; or qq (yy), and thus producing green peas\n(Figure 19.2). In other words, the frequency of pp individuals is simply p2; the frequency of pq individuals is 2pq; and the\nfrequency of qq individuals is q2. And, again, if p and q are the only two possible alleles for a given trait in the population,\nthese genotypes frequencies will sum to one: p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1.\nChapter 19 | The Evolution of Populations\n771\nFigure 19.2 When populations are in the Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium, the allelic frequency is stable from\ngeneration to generation and the distribution of alleles can be determined from the Hardy\u2013Weinberg equation. If\nthe allelic frequency measured in the field differs from the predicted value, scientists can make inferences about\nwhat evolutionary forces are at play.\nIn plants, violet flower color (V) is dominant over white (v). If p = 0.8 and q = 0.2 in a population of 500 plants,\nhow many individuals would you expect to be homozygous dominant (VV), heterozygous (Vv), and homozygous\nrecessive (vv)? How many plants would you expect to have violet flowers, and how many would have white flowers?\na.\nhomozygous dominant: 320 heterozygous: 160 homozygous recessive: 20 violet: 480 white: 20\nb.\nhomozygous dominant: 320 heterozygous: 80 homozygous recessive: 20 violet: 400 white: 20\nc.\nhomozygous dominant: 400 heterozygous: 0 homozygous recessive: 100 violet: 400 white: 100\nd.\nhomozygous dominant: 480 heterozygous: 0 homozygous recessive: 20 violet: 480 white: 20\nIn theory, if a population is at equilibrium\u2014that is, there are no evolutionary forces acting upon it\u2014generation after\ngeneration would have the same gene pool and genetic structure, and these equations would all hold true all of the time.\n772\nChapter 19 | The Evolution of Populations\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nOf course, even Hardy and Weinberg recognized that no natural population is immune to evolution. Populations in nature\nare constantly changing in genetic makeup due to drift, mutation, possibly migration, and selection. As a result, the only\nway to determine the exact distribution of phenotypes in a population is to go out and count them. But the Hardy\u2013Weinberg\nprinciple gives scientists a mathematical baseline of a non-evolving population to which they can compare evolving\npopulations and thereby infer what evolutionary forces might be at play. If the frequencies of alleles or genotypes deviate\nfrom the value expected from the Hardy\u2013Weinberg equation, then the population is evolving.\nUse this online calculator (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/hardy-weinberg) to determine the genetic structure of a\npopulation.\nWhat would violate the conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?\na.\nrandom mating\nb.\nmutations\nc.\nlarge population\nd.\nno natural selection\nLab Investigation\nAP\u00ae Biology Investigative Labs: Inquiry-Based Approach, Investigation 2: Mathematical Modeling:\nHardy\u2013Weinberg. In this lab investigation, you apply the Hardy\u2013Weinberg equation and create a\nspreadsheet to study changes in allele frequencies in a population and to examine possible causes for these\nchanges.\nThink About It\nImagine you are trying to determine if a population of flowers is undergoing microevolution. You suspect there is\nselection pressure on the color of the flower because bees seem to cluster around red flowers more often than blue\nflowers. In a separate experiment, you discover that blue flower color is dominant to red flower color. In a field, you\ncount 600 blue flowers and 200 red flowers. Based on the H-W equation, what are the expected allele frequencies for\nflower color?\nTwo years later, you revisit the same field and discover that out of 1,000 flowers, 650 are blue. Use the H\u2013W equation\nto determine if the population of flowers is undergoing evolution.\nChapter 19 | The Evolution of Populations\n773\n19.2 | Population Genetics\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the different types of variation in a population?\n\u2022\nWhy can only heritable variation be acted upon by natural selection?\n\u2022\nHow can genetic drift, the bottleneck effect, and the founder effect influence allele frequencies in a population?\n\u2022\nHow can gene flow, mutation, nonrandom mating, and environmental variance affect allele frequencies in a\npopulation?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nTake a look at your classmates. Individuals of a population often display different phenotypes, or express different alleles of\na particular gene. These differences are called polymorphisms. The distribution of phenotypes among individuals, known\nas population variation, is influenced by several factors, including the population\u2019s genetic structure and the environment\n(Figure 19.3). Understanding the sources of phenotypic variation is important for determining how a population will evolve\nin response to different evolutionary pressures. Only those variations that are encoded in an individual\u2019s genes can be passed\nto its offspring and be a target of natural selection.\nFigure 19.3 The distribution of phenotypes in this litter of kittens illustrates population variation. (credit: Pieter Lanser)\nAs you learn in the chapter that discusses the evolution and origin of species, natural selection works by selecting for\nphenotypes\u2014and the alleles that determine them\u2014that confer beneficial traits or behaviors.

        "summary": "Population evolution examines how genetic variation within populations changes over time, integrating Darwin\u2019s theory of natural selection with Mendelian genetics in what is known as the modern synthesis. This field, called population genetics, focuses on microevolution\u2014shifts in allele frequencies that can be measured to assess evolutionary change. The Hardy\u2013Weinberg principle provides a mathematical model for a non-evolving population, assuming no mutation, migration, genetic drift, selection, or non-random mating, and represents allele and genotype frequencies with the equation p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1. Deviations from predicted Hardy\u2013Weinberg values indicate evolutionary forces at work, such as natural selection, genetic drift, and the founder effect, which can alter a population\u2019s genetic structure. By comparing real-world data to this baseline, scientists can detect and study factors driving evolution, such as the increase in pesticide resistance alleles in mosquitoes over time."

Individuals of a population often display different phenotypes, or express different alleles of\na particular gene. These differences are called polymorphisms. The distribution of phenotypes among individuals, known\nas population variation, is influenced by several factors, including the population\u2019s genetic structure and the environment\n(Figure 19.3). Understanding the sources of phenotypic variation is important for determining how a population will evolve\nin response to different evolutionary pressures. Only those variations that are encoded in an individual\u2019s genes can be passed\nto its offspring and be a target of natural selection.\nFigure 19.3 The distribution of phenotypes in this litter of kittens illustrates population variation.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 1.1][APLO 1.3][APLO 1.4][APLO 1.8][APLO 1.23][APLO 1.24][APLO 1.25][APLO 1.6][APLO 1.7][APLO\n1.22]\nGenetic Variance\nNatural selection and some of the other evolutionary forces can only act on heritable traits, namely an organism\u2019s genetic\ncode. Because alleles are passed from parent to offspring, those that confer beneficial traits or behaviors may be selected\nfor, while deleterious alleles may be selected against. Acquired traits, for the most part, are not heritable. For example, if an\nathlete works out in the gym every day, building up muscle strength, the athlete\u2019s offspring will not necessarily grow up to\nbe a body builder. If there is a genetic basis for the ability to run fast, on the other hand, this may be passed to a child.\nBefore Darwinian evolution became the prevailing theory of the field, French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck theorized\nthat acquired traits could, in fact, be inherited; while this hypothesis has largely been unsupported, scientists have recently\nbegun to realize that Lamarck was not completely wrong. Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/epigenetic) to learn\nmore.\nExplain naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck\u2019s theory on heritability.\na.\nLamarck theorized that individuals more fit to their environment would me more likely to survive, reproduce,\nand pass on their genes.\nb.\nLamarck theorized that traits that parents acquired in their lifetime could be inherited by offspring in an\nattempt to improve.\nc.\nLamarck theorized that traits in offspring were a blend of traits from the two parents.\nd.\nLamarck theorized that inbreeding would lead to higher proportions of homozygous recessive genotypes,\npotentially conferring recessive diseases onto offspring.\nHeritability is the fraction of phenotype variation that can be attributed to genetic differences, or genetic variance, among\nindividuals in a population. The greater the hereditability of a population\u2019s phenotypic variation, the more susceptible it is\nto the evolutionary forces that act on heritable variation.\nThe diversity of alleles and genotypes within a population is called genetic variance. When scientists are involved in\nthe breeding of a species, such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves, they try to increase a population\u2019s genetic\nvariance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as they can. This also helps reduce the risks associated with\ninbreeding, the mating of closely related individuals, which can have the undesirable effect of bringing together deleterious\nrecessive mutations that can cause abnormalities and susceptibility to disease. For example, a disease that is caused by a\nrare, recessive allele might exist in a population, but it will only manifest itself when an individual carries two copies of\nthe allele. Because the allele is rare in a normal, healthy population with unrestricted habitat, the chance that two carriers\nwill mate is low, and even then, only 25 percent of their offspring will inherit the disease allele from both parents. While it\nis likely to happen at some point, it will not happen frequently enough for natural selection to be able to swiftly eliminate\nthe allele from the population, and as a result, the allele will be maintained at low levels in the gene pool. However, if a\nfamily of carriers begins to interbreed with each other, this will dramatically increase the likelihood of two carriers mating\nand eventually producing diseased offspring, a phenomenon known as inbreeding depression.\nChanges in allele frequencies that are identified in a population can shed light on how it is evolving. In addition to natural\nselection, there are other evolutionary forces that could be in play: genetic drift, gene flow, mutation, nonrandom mating,\nand environmental variances.\n776\nChapter 19 | The Evolution of Populations\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nGenetic Drift\nThe theory of natural selection stems from the observation that some individuals in a population are more likely to survive\nlonger and have more offspring than others; thus, they will pass on more of their genes to the next generation. A big,\npowerful male gorilla, for example, is much more likely than a smaller, weaker one to become the population\u2019s silverback,\nthe pack\u2019s leader who mates far more than the other males of the group. The pack leader will father more offspring, who\nshare half of his genes, and are likely to also grow bigger and stronger like their father. Over time, the genes for bigger size\nwill increase in frequency in the population, and the population will, as a result, grow larger on average. That is, this would\noccur if this particular selection pressure, or driving selective force, were the only one acting on the population. In other\nexamples, better camouflage or a stronger resistance to drought might pose a selection pressure.\nAnother way a population\u2019s allele and genotype frequencies can change is genetic drift (Figure 19.4), which is simply the\neffect of chance. By chance, some individuals will have more offspring than others\u2014not due to an advantage conferred\nby some genetically-encoded trait, but just because one male happened to be in the right place at the right time (when the\nreceptive female walked by) or because the other one happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time (when a fox was\nhunting).\nChapter 19 | The Evolution of Populations\n777\nFigure 19.4 Genetic drift occurs when the gene frequency of a population shifts by random chance (i.e. without a\nselective pressure). Over time, genetic drift can completely eliminate an allele from the population. For example,\nin the first generation here, the two alleles B and b occur with equal frequency, so p = q = 0.5. If only half the\nindividuals reproduce, and by chance most of the reproducing alleles of are of B, then the second generation\nresults in p = 0.7 and q = 0.3. In the second generation, only two individuals, both of whom are homozygote in B,\nreproduce. This leads to a loss of b from the third generation.\nAs seen from the table, the frequency of the b allele is reduced as a percentage of the population due to\ngenetic drift.\n778\nChapter 19 | The Evolution of Populations\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nGeneration\nIndividuals with\ngenotype BB\nIndividuals with\ngenotype Bb\nIndividuals with\ngenotype bb\n1\n22\n53\n25\n2\n108\n118\n25\n3\n633\n0\n0\nTable 19.1 Genotypic frequencies of rabbit populations undergoing genetic drift\nExplain why small populations are more vulnerable to the forces of genetic drift than large populations.\na.\nThe fewer individuals in a population, the more room there is for new individuals to migrate into it.\nb.\nThe more individuals in a population, the more alleles are present in its gene pool.\nc.\nThe fewer individuals in a population, the more likely it is to go extinct.\nd.\nThe more individuals in a population, the larger and more stable is its gene pool.\nSmall populations are more susceptible to the forces of genetic drift. Large populations, on the other hand, are buffered\nagainst the effects of chance. If one individual of a population of 10 individuals happens to die at a young age before it\nleaves any offspring to the next generation, all of its genes\u20141/10 of the population\u2019s gene pool\u2014will be suddenly lost. In\na population of 100, that\u2019s only 1 percent of the overall gene pool; therefore, it is much less impactful on the population\u2019s\ngenetic structure.\nGo to this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/genetic_drift) to watch an animation of random sampling and genetic drift\nin action.\nDescribe an example of genetic drift.\na.\nImmigration of new individuals can cause genetic drift. For example, if several white rabbits migrate into a\npopulation of mostly brown rabbits, the allele for white fur will increase within the population.\nb.\nIntroduction of new alleles through mutation can cause genetic drift. For example, if there are two alleles for\nfur color in a rabbit population, and a mutation in one of them produces a third allele, the gene pool changes\nto incorporate the new allele.\nc.\nChance events such as a natural disasters can cause genetic drift. For example, if the only white rabbits in a\npopulation get killed by a storm, the allele for white fur will diminish or disappear in the population.\nd.\nDifferential survival and reproduction can cause genetic drift. For example, if all the white rabbits in a\npopulation get eaten by wolves because their white fur stands out and is more visible, the proportion of the\nallele for white fur in the population will decrease.\nGenetic drift can also be magnified by natural events, such as a natural disaster that kills\u2014at random\u2014a large portion of\nthe population. Known as the bottleneck effect, it results in a large portion of the genome suddenly being wiped out (Figure\n19.5). In one fell swoop, the genetic structure of the survivors becomes the genetic structure of the entire population, which\nmay be very different from the pre-disaster population.\nChapter 19 | The Evolution of Populations\n779\nFigure 19.5 A chance event or catastrophe can reduce the genetic variability within a population.\nAnother scenario in which populations might experience a strong influence of genetic drift is if some portion of the\npopulation leaves to start a new population in a new location or if a population gets divided by a physical barrier of\nsome kind. In this situation, those individuals are unlikely to be representative of the entire population, which results in\nthe founder effect. The founder effect occurs when the genetic structure changes to match that of the new population\u2019s\nfounding fathers and mothers. The founder effect is believed to have been a key factor in the genetic history of the Afrikaner\npopulation of Dutch settlers in South Africa, as evidenced by mutations that are common in Afrikaners but rare in most\nother populations. This is likely due to the fact that a higher-than-normal proportion of the founding colonists carried\nthese mutations. As a result, the population expresses unusually high incidences of Huntington\u2019s disease (HD) and Fanconi\nanemia (FA), a genetic disorder known to cause blood marrow and congenital abnormalities.\nWatch this short video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/founder_bottle) to learn more about the founder and bottleneck\neffects.\nCompare and contrast the bottleneck and founder effects.\na.\nBoth the bottleneck and founder effect are examples of gene flow. However, the bottleneck effect occurs\nafter a cataclysmic event, whereas the founder effect occurs when mutations introduce new alleles into a\npopulation.\nb.\nBoth the bottleneck and founder effect are examples of genetic drift. However, the bottleneck effect is a\nprocess in which a large portion of a genome is wiped out, whereas the founder effect occurs when members\nof a larger population migrate to establish their own population.\nc.\nBoth the bottleneck and founder effect change the genetic structure of a population. However, the bottleneck\neffect reduces or eliminates alleles within a population, whereas the founder effect introduces or increases\nalleles.\nd.\nBoth the bottleneck and founder effect change the genetic structure of a population. However, the bottleneck\neffect occurs when inbreeding depression kills off part of a population, whereas the founder effect relies on\nnonrandom mating.\n780\nChapter 19 | The Evolution of Populations\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nTesting the Bottleneck Effect\nQuestion: How do natural disasters affect the genetic structure of a population?\nBackground: When much of a population is suddenly wiped out by an earthquake or hurricane, the\nindividuals that survive the event are usually a random sampling of the original group. As a result, the\ngenetic makeup of the population can change dramatically. This phenomenon is known as the bottleneck\neffect.\nHypothesis: Repeated natural disasters will yield different population genetic structures; therefore, each\ntime this experiment is run, the results will vary.\nTest the hypothesis: Count out the original population using different colored beads. For example, red,\nblue, and yellow beads might represent red, blue, and yellow individuals. After recording the number of\neach individual in the original population, place them all in a bottle with a narrow neck that will only allow a\nfew beads out at a time. Then, pour 1/3 of the bottle\u2019s contents into a bowl. This represents the surviving\nindividuals after a natural disaster kills a majority of the population. Count the number of the different colored\nbeads in the bowl, and record it. Then, place all of the beads back in the bottle and repeat the experiment\nfour more times.\nAnalyze the data: Compare the five populations that resulted from the experiment. Do the populations all\ncontain the same number of different colored beads, or do they vary? Remember, these populations all\ncame from the same exact parent population.\nForm a conclusion: Most likely, the five resulting populations will differ quite dramatically. This is because\nnatural disasters are not selective\u2014they kill and spare individuals at random. Now think about how this\nmight affect a real population. What happens when a hurricane hits the Mississippi Gulf Coast? How do the\nseabirds that live on the beach fare?\nGene Flow\nAnother important evolutionary force is gene flow: the flow of alleles in and out of a population due to the migration of\nindividuals or gametes (Figure 19.6). While some populations are fairly stable, others experience more flux. Many plants,\nfor example, send their pollen far and wide, by wind or by bird, to pollinate other populations of the same species some\ndistance away. Even a population that may initially appear to be stable, such as a pride of lions, can experience its fair share\nof immigration and emigration as developing males leave their mothers to seek out a new pride with genetically unrelated\nfemales. This variable flow of individuals in and out of the group not only changes the gene structure of the population, but\nit can also introduce new genetic variation to populations in different geological locations and habitats.\nFigure 19.6 Gene flow can occur when an individual travels from one geographic location to another.\nMutation\nMutations are changes to an organism\u2019s DNA and are an important driver of diversity in populations. Species evolve\nbecause of the accumulation of mutations that occur over time. The appearance of new mutations is the most common\nway to introduce novel genotypic and phenotypic variance. Some mutations are unfavorable or harmful and are quickly\nChapter 19 | The Evolution of Populations\n781\neliminated from the population by natural selection. Others are beneficial and will spread through the population. Whether\nor not a mutation is beneficial or harmful is determined by whether it helps an organism survive to sexual maturity and\nreproduce. Some mutations do not do anything and can linger, unaffected by natural selection, in the genome. Some can\nhave a dramatic effect on a gene and the resulting phenotype.\nNonrandom Mating\nIf individuals nonrandomly mate with their peers, the result can be a changing population. There are many reasons\nnonrandom mating occurs. One reason is simple mate choice; for example, female peahens may prefer peacocks with\nbigger, brighter tails. Traits that lead to more matings for an individual become selected for by natural selection. One\ncommon form of mate choice, called assortative mating, is an individual\u2019s preference to mate with partners who are\nphenotypically similar to themselves.\nAnother cause of nonrandom mating is physical location. This is especially true in large populations spread over large\ngeographic distances where not all individuals will have equal access to one another. Some might be miles apart through\nwoods or over rough terrain, while others might live immediately nearby.\nEnvironmental Variance\nGenes are not the only players involved in determining population variation. Phenotypes are also influenced by other\nfactors, such as the environment (Figure 19.7). For example, sun exposure is an environmental factor, as a person who\nspends more time in the sun will likely have darker skin than a person who spends most of their time indoors (assuming both\npeople had similarly-colored skin to start with). Some major characteristics, such as sex, are determined by the environment\nfor some species. For example, some turtles and other reptiles have temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). TSD\nmeans that individuals develop into males if their eggs are incubated within a certain temperature range, or females at a\ndifferent temperature range.\nFigure 19.7 The sex of the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) is determined by the temperature at which\nthe eggs are incubated. Eggs incubated at 30\u00b0C produce females, and eggs incubated at 33\u00b0C produce males. (credit:\nSteve Hillebrand, USFWS)\nGeographic separation between populations can lead to differences in the phenotypic variation between those populations.\nSuch geographical variation is seen between most populations and can be significant. One type of geographic variation,\ncalled a cline, can be seen as populations of a given species vary gradually across an ecological gradient. Species of warm-\nblooded animals, for example, tend to have larger bodies in the cooler climates closer to the earth\u2019s poles, allowing them to\nbetter conserve heat. This is considered a latitudinal cline. Alternatively, flowering plants tend to bloom at different times\ndepending on where they are along the slope of a mountain, known as an altitudinal cline.\nIf there is gene flow between the populations, the individuals will likely show gradual differences in phenotype along the\ncline. Restricted gene flow, on the other hand, can lead to abrupt differences, even speciation.\n782\nChapter 19 | The Evolution of Populations\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nLab Investigation\nAP\u00ae Biology Investigative Labs: Inquiry-Based Approach, Investigation 1: Artificial Selection.

In other words, natural selection favors the most adaptive\nvariation for a given environment. If the fit phenotypes are evolving in a stable environment, natural selection results in\nstabilizing selection, resulting in an overall decrease in the population\u2019s variation. However, if environmental conditions\nchange, directional selection shifts a population\u2019s variance toward a new and more favorable phenotype. Diversifying\nselection results in increased variance by selecting for two or more distinct phenotypes.\nSexual selection results when one sex has more reproductive success than the other; as a result, males and females\nexperience different selective pressures, which often lead to distinct phenotypic differences, or sexual dimorphisms,\nbetween the two. For example, male birds often exhibit more colorful plumage than female birds of the same species.\nWhat is most important to recognize is that there is no perfect organism. Natural selection acts on existing variations in the\npopulation; it does not create anything from scratch. Although natural selection selects the fittest individuals, other forces of\nevolution, including genetic drift and gene flow, often introduce deleterious alleles to the population\u2019s gene pool.

        "summary": "Population genetics examines the distribution of heritable variations within populations and the factors that alter allele frequencies over time, leading to microevolution. Only genetic, heritable traits can be acted upon by natural selection, while acquired traits generally cannot. Genetic variation within a population arises from mutation, gene flow, and recombination, and can be reduced by inbreeding, bottleneck events, and the founder effect. Genetic drift changes allele frequencies through random chance, especially in small populations, while gene flow introduces or removes alleles via migration. Mutations provide new genetic material, potentially influencing fitness, and nonrandom mating can alter genotype frequencies by favoring certain phenotypes. Environmental factors\u2014such as climate or geography\u2014can also influence phenotypic variation, producing patterns like clines across ecological gradients. Together, these forces\u2014including natural selection, drift, migration, mutation, mating patterns, and environmental variation\u2014interact to shape population genetic structure and drive evolutionary change."

Explain how you know for each population.\n19.3 | Adaptive Evolution\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are different ways in which natural selection can shape populations?\n\u2022\nHow can these different forces lead to different outcomes in terms of population variation?\nConnections for AP\u00ae Courses\nAs we have learned, natural selection acts on the level of the individual, selecting those with a higher overall fitness\n(reproductive success) compared to the rest of the population. In other words, natural selection favors the most adaptive\nvariation for a given environment. If the fit phenotypes are evolving in a stable environment, natural selection results in\nstabilizing selection, resulting in an overall decrease in the population\u2019s variation. However, if environmental conditions\nchange, directional selection shifts a population\u2019s variance toward a new and more favorable phenotype. Diversifying\nselection results in increased variance by selecting for two or more distinct phenotypes.\nSexual selection results when one sex has more reproductive success than the other; as a result, males and females\nexperience different selective pressures, which often lead to distinct phenotypic differences, or sexual dimorphisms,\nbetween the two. For example, male birds often exhibit more colorful plumage than female birds of the same species.\nWhat is most important to recognize is that there is no perfect organism. Natural selection acts on existing variations in the\npopulation; it does not create anything from scratch. Although natural selection selects the fittest individuals, other forces of\nevolution, including genetic drift and gene flow, often introduce deleterious alleles to the population\u2019s gene pool. Evolution\nhas no purpose; it is simply the sum of various forces that influence the genetic and phenotypic variation of a population.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 1 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework. The AP\u00ae Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent\nfoundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP\u00ae exam\nquestions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.\nBig Idea 1\nThe process of evolution drives the diversity and unity of life.\nChapter 19 | The Evolution of Populations\n783\nEnduring\nUnderstanding\n1.A\nChange in the genetic makeup of a population over time is evolution.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n1.A.1 Natural selection is a major mechanism of evolution.\nScience Practice\n2.2 The student can apply mathematical routines to quantities that describe natural\nphenomena.\nScience Practice\n5.3 The student can evaluate the evidence provided by data sets in relation to a particular\nscientific question.\nLearning\nObjective\n1.2 The student is able to evaluate evidence provided by data to qualitatively and\nquantitatively investigate the role of natural selection in evolution.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n1.A.2 Natural selection acts on phenotypic variations in populations.\nScience Practice\n7.1 The student can connect phenomena and models across spatial and temporal scales.\nLearning\nObjective\n1.5 The student is able to connect evolutionary changes in a population over time to a\nchange in the environment.\nNatural selection only acts on the population\u2019s heritable traits: selecting for beneficial alleles and thus increasing their\nfrequency in the population, while selecting against deleterious alleles and thereby decreasing their frequency\u2014a process\nknown as adaptive evolution. Natural selection does not act on individual alleles, however, but on entire organisms. An\nindividual may carry a very beneficial genotype with a resulting phenotype that, for example, increases the ability to\nreproduce (fecundity), but if that same individual also carries an allele that results in a fatal childhood disease, that fecundity\nphenotype will not be passed on to the next generation because the individual will not live to reach reproductive age. Natural\nselection acts at the level of the individual; it selects for individuals with greater contributions to the gene pool of the next\ngeneration, known as an organism\u2019s evolutionary (Darwinian) fitness.\nFitness is often quantifiable and is measured by scientists in the field. However, it is not the absolute fitness of an individual\nthat counts, but rather how it compares to the other organisms in the population. This concept, called relative fitness, allows\nresearchers to determine which individuals are contributing additional offspring to the next generation, and thus, how the\npopulation might evolve.\nThere are several ways selection can affect population variation: stabilizing selection, directional selection, diversifying\nselection, frequency-dependent selection, and sexual selection. As natural selection influences the allele frequencies in a\npopulation, individuals can either become more or less genetically similar and the phenotypes displayed can become more\nsimilar or more disparate.\nStabilizing Selection\nIf natural selection favors an average phenotype, selecting against extreme variation, the population will undergo stabilizing\nselection (Figure 19.9). In a population of mice that live in the woods, for example, natural selection is likely to favor\nindividuals that best blend in with the forest floor and are less likely to be spotted by predators. Assuming the ground is a\nfairly consistent shade of brown, those mice whose fur is most closely matched to that color will be most likely to survive\nand reproduce, passing on their genes for their brown coat. Mice that carry alleles that make them a bit lighter or a bit darker\nwill stand out against the ground and be more likely to fall victim to predation. As a result of this selection, the population\u2019s\ngenetic variance will decrease.\nDirectional Selection\nWhen the environment changes, populations will often undergo directional selection (Figure 19.9), which selects for\nphenotypes at one end of the spectrum of existing variation. A classic example of this type of selection is the evolution\nof the peppered moth in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century England. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, the moths were\npredominately light in color, which allowed them to blend in with the light-colored trees and lichens in their environment.\nBut as soot began spewing from factories, the trees became darkened, and the light-colored moths became easier for\npredatory birds to spot. Over time, the frequency of the melanic form of the moth increased because they had a higher\nsurvival rate in habitats affected by air pollution because their darker coloration blended with the sooty trees.\n784\nChapter 19 | The Evolution of Populations\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nScientist can observe directional selection. Suppose populations of rabbits that eat flowers is introduced into an environment\nwith flowering plants. Once the flowers are eaten, the plants cannot reproduce. Over time, the height of the flowers will\nshift higher so that the rabbits cannot reach them ???.\nFigure 19.8 The introduction of small herbivores that eat flowers often results in directional selection for increased\nflower height.\nIn science, sometimes things are believed to be true, and then new information comes to light that changes our\nunderstanding. The story of the peppered moth is an example: the facts behind the selection toward darker moths have\nrecently been called into question. Read this article (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/peppered_moths) to learn more.\nWhat is fitness the measure of?\na.\nthe frequency of beneficial alleles\nb.\nthe effect of chance on a population\u2019s gene pool\nc.\nsuccessful reproduction\nd.\nthe abnormalities in a population\nChapter 19 | The Evolution of Populations\n785\nDiversifying Selection\nSometimes two or more distinct phenotypes can each have their advantages and be selected for by natural selection, while\nthe intermediate phenotypes are, on average, less fit. Known as diversifying selection (Figure 19.9), this is seen in many\npopulations of animals that have multiple male forms. Large, dominant alpha males obtain mates by brute force, while\nsmall males can sneak in for furtive copulations with the females in an alpha male\u2019s territory. In this case, both the alpha\nmales and the \u201csneaking\u201d males will be selected for, but medium-sized males, which can\u2019t overtake the alpha males and\nare too big to sneak copulations, are selected against. Diversifying selection can also occur when environmental changes\nfavor individuals on either end of the phenotypic spectrum. Imagine a population of mice living at the beach where there\nis light-colored sand interspersed with patches of tall grass. In this scenario, light-colored mice that blend in with the sand\nwould be favored, as well as dark-colored mice that can hide in the grass. Medium-colored mice, on the other hand, would\nnot blend in with either the grass or the sand, and would thus be more likely to be eaten by predators. The result of this type\nof selection is increased genetic variance as the population becomes more diverse.\n786\nChapter 19 | The Evolution of Populations\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 19.9 Different types of natural selection can impact the distribution of phenotypes within a population. In\n(a) stabilizing selection, an average phenotype is favored. In (b) directional selection, a change in the environment\nshifts the spectrum of phenotypes observed. In (c) diversifying selection, two or more extreme phenotypes are\nselected for, while the average phenotype is selected against.\nBefore the Industrial revolution light-colored moths were able to blend in with the environment and better avoid\npredators. Since the Industrial Revolution, dark-colored moths are better camouflaged than light-colored moths. The\nnumber of dark-colored moths has increased to be the most common color. This is an example of what?\na.\ndirectional selection\nb.\nstabilizing selection\nc.\nfrequency-dependent selection\nd.\ndiversifying selection\nFrequency-dependent Selection\nAnother type of selection, called frequency-dependent selection, favors phenotypes that are either common (positive\nfrequency-dependent selection) or rare (negative frequency-dependent selection). An interesting example of this type of\nselection is seen in a unique group of lizards of the Pacific Northwest. Male common side-blotched lizards come in three\nthroat-color patterns: orange, blue, and yellow. Each of these forms has a different reproductive strategy: orange males\nare the strongest and can fight other males for access to their females; blue males are medium-sized and form strong pair\nbonds with their mates; and yellow males (Figure 19.10) are the smallest, and look a bit like females, which allows them\nChapter 19 | The Evolution of Populations\n787\nto sneak copulations. Like a game of rock-paper-scissors, orange beats blue, blue beats yellow, and yellow beats orange in\nthe competition for females. That is, the big, strong orange males can fight off the blue males to mate with the blue\u2019s pair-\nbonded females, the blue males are successful at guarding their mates against yellow sneaker males, and the yellow males\ncan sneak copulations from the potential mates of the large, polygynous orange males.\nFigure 19.10 A yellow-throated side-blotched lizard is smaller than either the blue-throated or orange-throated males\nand appears a bit like the females of the species, allowing it to sneak copulations. (credit: \u201ctinyfroglet\u201d/Flickr)\nIn this scenario, orange males will be favored by natural selection when the population is dominated by blue males, blue\nmales will thrive when the population is mostly yellow males, and yellow males will be selected for when orange males are\nthe most populous. As a result, populations of side-blotched lizards cycle in the distribution of these phenotypes\u2014in one\ngeneration, orange might be predominant, and then yellow males will begin to rise in frequency. Once yellow males make\nup a majority of the population, blue males will be selected for. Finally, when blue males become common, orange males\nwill once again be favored.\nNegative frequency-dependent selection serves to increase the population\u2019s genetic variance by selecting for rare\nphenotypes, whereas positive frequency-dependent selection usually decreases genetic variance by selecting for common\nphenotypes.\nSexual Selection\nMales and females of certain species are often quite different from one another in ways beyond the reproductive organs.\nMales are often larger, for example, and display many elaborate colors and adornments, like the peacock\u2019s tail, while\nfemales tend to be smaller and duller in decoration. Such differences are known as sexual dimorphisms (Figure 19.11),\nwhich arise from the fact that in many populations, particularly animal populations, there is more variance in the\nreproductive success of the males than there is of the females. That is, some males\u2014often the bigger, stronger, or more\ndecorated males\u2014get the vast majority of the total matings, while others receive none. This can occur because the males\nare better at fighting off other males, or because females will choose to mate with the bigger or more decorated males. In\neither case, this variation in reproductive success generates a strong selection pressure among males to get those matings,\nresulting in the evolution of bigger body size and elaborate ornaments to get the females\u2019 attention. Females, on the other\nhand, tend to get a handful of selected matings; therefore, they are more likely to select more desirable males.\nSexual dimorphism varies widely among species, of course, and some species are even sex-role reversed. In such cases,\nfemales tend to have a greater variance in their reproductive success than males and are correspondingly selected for the\nbigger body size and elaborate traits usually characteristic of males.\n788\nChapter 19 | The Evolution of Populations\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 19.11 Sexual dimorphism is observed in (a) peacocks and peahens, (b) Argiope appensa spiders (the female\nspider is the large one), and in (c) wood ducks. (credit \u201cspiders\u201d: modification of work by \u201cSanba38\u201d/Wikimedia\nCommons; credit \u201cduck\u201d: modification of work by Kevin Cole)\nThe selection pressures on males and females to obtain matings is known as sexual selection; it can result in the\ndevelopment of secondary sexual characteristics that do not benefit the individual\u2019s likelihood of survival but help to\nmaximize its reproductive success. Sexual selection can be so strong that it selects for traits that are actually detrimental\nto the individual\u2019s survival. Think, once again, about the peacock\u2019s tail. While it is beautiful and the male with the largest,\nmost colorful tail is more likely to win the female, it is not the most practical appendage. In addition to being more visible\nto predators, it makes the males slower in their attempted escapes. There is some evidence that this risk, in fact, is why\nfemales like the big tails in the first place. The speculation is that large tails carry risk, and only the best males survive that\nrisk: the bigger the tail, the more fit the male. This idea is known as the handicap principle.\nThe good genes hypothesis states that males develop these impressive ornaments to show off their efficient metabolism\nor their ability to fight disease. Females then choose males with the most impressive traits because it signals their genetic\nsuperiority, which they will then pass on to their offspring. Though it might be argued that females should not be picky\nbecause it will likely reduce their number of offspring, if better males father more fit offspring, it may be beneficial. Fewer,\nhealthier offspring may increase the chances of survival more than many, weaker offspring.\nChapter 19 | The Evolution of Populations\n789\nIn 1915, biologist Ronald Fisher proposed another model of sexual selection: the Fisherian runaway model\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/sexual_select) , which suggests that selection of certain traits is a result of sexual\npreference.\nExplain the handicap principle.\na.\nThe peacock\u2019s tail is an example of the handicap principle. Having a healthy, beautiful tail discourages\npredation, helping in survival. This means that those individuals are most likely to survive and produce\noffspring.\nb.\nThe peacock\u2019s tail is an example of the handicap principle. It appears that the tail makes the males more\nvisible to predators and less able to escape, making it a disadvantage to the birds\u2019 survival. However, traits\ncannot evolve in a population if they serve as a handicap to the individuals that express that trait. Therefore,\nthe tail must actually be an advantage.\nc.\nThe peacock\u2019s tail is an example of the handicap principle. The tail makes the males more visible to predators\nand less able to escape, so the birds with the longest and most extravagant tails get eaten and do not\nreproduce. This causes the average tail length for males within the population to decrease over time due to\nnatural selection.\nd.\nThe peacock\u2019s tail is an example of the handicap principle. The tail, which makes the males more visible\nto predators and less able to escape, is clearly a disadvantage to the birds\u2019 survival. But because it is a\ndisadvantage, only the most fit males should be able to survive with it. Thus, the tail serves as an honest\nsignal of quality to the females of the population; therefore, the male will earn more matings and greater\nreproductive success.\nIn both the handicap principle and the good genes hypothesis, the trait is said to be an honest signal of the males\u2019 quality,\nthus giving females a way to find the fittest mates\u2014 males that will pass the best genes to their offspring.\nNo Perfect Organism\nNatural selection is a driving force in evolution and can generate populations that are better adapted to survive and\nsuccessfully reproduce in their environments. But natural selection cannot produce the perfect organism. Natural selection\ncan only select on existing variation in the population; it does not create anything from scratch. Thus, it is limited by a\npopulation\u2019s existing genetic variance and whatever new alleles arise through mutation and gene flow.\nNatural selection is also limited because it works at the level of individuals, not alleles, and some alleles are linked due\nto their physical proximity in the genome, making them more likely to be passed on together (linkage disequilibrium).\nAny given individual may carry some beneficial alleles and some unfavorable alleles. It is the net effect of these alleles,\nor the organism\u2019s fitness, upon which natural selection can act. As a result, good alleles can be lost if they are carried\nby individuals that also have several overwhelmingly bad alleles; likewise, bad alleles can be kept if they are carried by\nindividuals that have enough good alleles to result in an overall fitness benefit.\nFurthermore, natural selection can be constrained by the relationships between different polymorphisms. One morph may\nconfer a higher fitness than another, but may not increase in frequency due to the fact that going from the less beneficial\nto the more beneficial trait would require going through a less beneficial phenotype. Think back to the mice that live at\nthe beach. Some are light-colored and blend in with the sand, while others are dark and blend in with the patches of grass.\nThe dark-colored mice may be, overall, more fit than the light-colored mice, and at first glance, one might expect the light-\ncolored mice be selected for a darker coloration. But remember that the intermediate phenotype, a medium-colored coat, is\nvery bad for the mice\u2014they cannot blend in with either the sand or the grass and are more likely to be eaten by predators.\nAs a result, the light-colored mice would not be selected for a dark coloration because those individuals that began moving\nin that direction (began being selected for a darker coat) would be less fit than those that stayed light.\n790\nChapter 19 | The Evolution of Populations\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFinally, it is important to understand that not all evolution is adaptive. While natural selection selects the fittest individuals\nand often results in a more fit population overall, other forces of evolution, including genetic drift and gene flow, often do\nthe opposite: introducing deleterious alleles to the population\u2019s gene pool. Evolution has no purpose\u2014it is not changing\na population into a preconceived ideal. It is simply the sum of the various forces described in this chapter and how they\ninfluence the genetic and phenotypic variance of a population.\nThink About It\nIn recent years, factories have been cleaner, and less soot is released into the environment.

        "summary": "Adaptive evolution is the process by which natural selection increases the frequency of beneficial alleles and decreases harmful ones, acting on heritable traits to enhance an organism\u2019s evolutionary fitness\u2014its relative reproductive success compared to others in the population. Selection can take several forms: stabilizing selection favors average phenotypes and reduces variation; directional selection shifts traits toward one extreme in response to environmental changes; diversifying selection favors multiple extremes over intermediate traits, increasing variance; and frequency-dependent selection favors either common or rare phenotypes, influencing genetic diversity accordingly. Sexual selection, driven by differences in reproductive success between sexes, often produces sexual dimorphisms and can lead to traits that enhance mating success even at a survival cost, explained by ideas like the handicap principle and good genes hypothesis. Natural selection has limitations\u2014it works only on existing variation, is constrained by genetic linkage and intermediate disadvantageous traits, and does not produce \u201cperfect\u201d organisms. Moreover, evolution is not always adaptive, as forces like genetic drift and gene flow can introduce deleterious alleles into populations."

By following pathways of similarities and changes\u2014both visible and genetic\u2014scientists seek to map\nthe evolutionary past of how life developed from single-celled organisms to the tremendous variety of creatures that have\ngerminated, crawled, floated, swam, flown, and walked on this planet.\nNew species are discovered with frequent regularity, but it\u2019s not too common to discover a new large mammal. However,\nthat\u2019s what scientists did in Australia when they named a new species of cetacean the Australian humpback dolphin, Souse\nsahulensis. The dolphin had originally been classified as another closely related species, but a closer look at its coloration,\nskeletal structure, habitat, and DNA determined that it was in fact a separate species.\nFor more information, read the research article (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32dolphin) yourself.\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\n807\n20.1 | Organizing Life on Earth\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhy do scientists need a comprehensive classification system to study living organisms?\n\u2022\nWhat are the different levels of the taxonomic classification system?\n\u2022\nHow are systematics and taxonomy related to phylogeny?\n\u2022\nWhat are the components and purpose of a phylogenetic tree?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nIn prior chapters we explored how all organisms on Earth, extant and extinct, evolved from common ancestry. Supporting\nthis claim are core features and processes, such as a common genetic code and metabolic pathways, which evolved billions\nof years ago and are widely distributed among organisms living today. The evolutionary history and relationship of an\norganism or a group of organisms is called phylogeny. Scientists often construct phylogenetic trees based on evidence\ndrawn from multiple disciplines to illustrate evolutionary pathways and connections among organisms.\nScientists historically organized Earth\u2019s millions of species into a hierarchical taxonomic classification system from the\nmost inclusive category to the most specific: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. The\ntraditional five-kingdom system that you might have studied in middle school was expanded (and reorganized) to include\nthree domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, with prokaryotes divided between Bacteria or Archaea depending on their\nmolecular genetic machinery, and protists, fungi, plants, and animals grouped in Eukarya. Today, however, phylogenetic\ntrees provide more specific information about evolutionary history and relationships among organisms. (For the purpose of\nAP\u00ae, you do not have to memorize the taxonomic levels. However, it is important to reiterate that taxonomy is a tool to\norganize the millions of organisms on Earth, similar to how items in a grocery store or mall shop are organized into different\ndepartments. Like new products, organisms are often shifted among their taxonomic groups!)\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 1 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework.

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 1.20][APLO 1.26]\nPhylogenetic Trees\nScientists use a tool called a phylogenetic tree to show the evolutionary pathways and connections among organisms. A\nphylogenetic tree is a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms. Scientists\nconsider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since one cannot go back to confirm the proposed\nrelationships. In other words, a \u201ctree of life\u201d can be constructed to illustrate when different organisms evolved and to show\nthe relationships among different organisms (Figure 20.2).\nUnlike a taxonomic classification diagram, a phylogenetic tree can be read like a map of evolutionary history. Many\nphylogenetic trees have a single lineage at the base representing a common ancestor. Scientists call such trees rooted, which\nmeans there is a single ancestral lineage (typically drawn from the bottom or left) to which all organisms represented in the\ndiagram relate. Notice in the rooted phylogenetic tree that the three domains\u2014 Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya\u2014diverge\nfrom a single point and branch off. The small branch that plants and animals (including humans) occupy in this diagram\nshows how recent and miniscule these groups are compared with other organisms. Unrooted trees don\u2019t show a common\nancestor but do show relationships among species.\nFigure 20.2 Both of these phylogenetic trees shows the relationship of the three domains of life\u2014Bacteria, Archaea,\nand Eukarya\u2014but the (a) rooted tree attempts to identify when various species diverged from a common ancestor\nwhile the (b) unrooted tree does not. (credit a: modification of work by Eric Gaba)\nIn a rooted tree, the branching indicates evolutionary relationships (Figure 20.3). The point where a split occurs, called\na branch point, represents where a single lineage evolved into a distinct new one. A lineage that evolved early from the\nroot and remains unbranched is called basal taxon. When two lineages stem from the same branch point, they are called\nsister taxa. A branch with more than two lineages is called a polytomy and serves to illustrate where scientists have not\ndefinitively determined all of the relationships. It is important to note that although sister taxa and polytomy do share an\nancestor, it does not mean that the groups of organisms split or evolved from each other. Organisms in two taxa may have\nsplit apart at a specific branch point, but neither taxa gave rise to the other.\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\n809\nFigure 20.3 The root of a phylogenetic tree indicates that an ancestral lineage gave rise to all organisms on the tree.\nA branch point indicates where two lineages diverged. A lineage that evolved early and remains unbranched is a basal\ntaxon. When two lineages stem from the same branch point, they are sister taxa. A branch with more than two lineages\nis a polytomy.\nThe diagrams above can serve as a pathway to understanding evolutionary history. The pathway can be traced from the\norigin of life to any individual species by navigating through the evolutionary branches between the two points. Also, by\nstarting with a single species and tracing back towards the \"trunk\" of the tree, one can discover that species' ancestors, as\nwell as where lineages share a common ancestry. In addition, the tree can be used to study entire groups of organisms.\nAnother point to mention on phylogenetic tree structure is that rotation at branch points does not change the information.\nFor example, if a branch point was rotated and the taxon order changed, this would not alter the information because the\nevolution of each taxon from the branch point was independent of the other.\nMany disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time; these\ndisciplines together contribute to building, updating, and maintaining the \u201ctree of life.\u201d Information is used to organize and\nclassify organisms based on evolutionary relationships in a scientific field called systematics. Data may be collected from\nfossils, from studying the structure of body parts or molecules used by an organism, and by DNA analysis. By combining\ndata from many sources, scientists can put together the phylogeny of an organism; since phylogenetic trees are hypotheses,\nthey will continue to change as new types of life are discovered and new information is learned.\nLimitations of Phylogenetic Trees\nIt may be easy to assume that more closely related organisms look more alike, and while this is often the case, it is not\nalways true. If two closely related lineages evolved under significantly varied surroundings or after the evolution of a major\nnew adaptation, it is possible for the two groups to appear more different than other groups that are not as closely related.\nFor example, the phylogenetic tree in Figure 20.4 shows that lizards and rabbits both have amniotic eggs, whereas frogs do\nnot; yet lizards and frogs appear more similar than lizards and rabbits.\nFigure 20.4 This ladder-like phylogenetic tree of vertebrates is rooted by an organism that lacked a vertebral column.\nAt each branch point, organisms with different characters are placed in different groups based on the characteristics\nthey share.\n810\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nAnother aspect of phylogenetic trees is that, unless otherwise indicated, the branches do not account for length of time, only\nthe evolutionary order. In other words, the length of a branch does not typically mean more time passed, nor does a short\nbranch mean less time passed\u2014 unless specified on the diagram. For example, in Figure 20.4, the tree does not indicate\nhow much time passed between the evolution of amniotic eggs and hair. What the tree does show is the order in which\nthings took place. Again using Figure 20.4, the tree shows that the oldest trait is the vertebral column, followed by hinged\njaws, and so forth. Remember that any phylogenetic tree is a part of the greater whole, and like a real tree, it does not grow\nin only one direction after a new branch develops. So, for the organisms in Figure 20.4, just because a vertebral column\nevolved does not mean that invertebrate evolution ceased, it only means that a new branch formed. Also, groups that are not\nclosely related, but evolve under similar conditions, may appear more phenotypically similar to each other than to a close\nrelative.\nHead to this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/tree_of_life) to see interactive exercises that allow you to explore the\nevolutionary relationships among species.\nWhat is the main function of the ITOL (Interactive Tree of Life) website?\na.\niTOL is a website that provides the history about the Tree of Life.\nb.\niTOL is a website that provides guidelines for researching data to create a phylogenetic tree.\nc.\niTOL is an online tool that provides the display and manipulation of pre-computed phylogenetic trees, and\nyou can upload and display your own trees and data.\nd.\niTOL is a website that explains the evolutionary relationships among species.\nThink About It\nHow does a phylogenetic tree relate to the passing of time? What other questions about the evolutionary history of an\norganism and its relatedness to other organisms can a phylogenetic tree answer?\nThe Levels of Classification\nTaxonomy (which literally means \u201carrangement law\u201d) is the science of classifying organisms to construct internationally\nshared classification systems with each organism placed into more and more inclusive groupings. Think about how a\ngrocery store is organized. One large space is divided into departments, such as produce, dairy, and meats. Then each\ndepartment further divides into aisles, then each aisle into categories and brands, and then finally a single product. This\norganization from larger to smaller, more specific categories is called a hierarchical system.\nThe taxonomic classification system (also called the Linnaean system after its inventor, Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist,\nzoologist, and physician) uses a hierarchical model. Moving from the point of origin, the groups become more specific,\nuntil one branch ends as a single species. For example, after the common beginning of all life, scientists divide organisms\ninto three large categories called a domain: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Within each domain is a second category called\na kingdom. After kingdoms, the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are: phylum, class, order, family, genus,\nand species (Figure 20.5).\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\n811\nFigure 20.5 The taxonomic classification system uses a hierarchical model to organize living organisms into\nincreasingly specific categories. The common dog, Canis lupus familiaris, is a subspecies of Canis lupus, which also\nincludes the wolf and dingo. (credit \u201cdog\u201d: modification of work by Janneke Vreugdenhil)\nThe kingdom Animalia stems from the Eukarya domain. For the common dog, the classification levels would be as shown\nin Figure 20.5. Therefore, the full name of an organism technically has eight terms. For the dog, it is: Eukarya, Animalia,\nChordata, Mammalia, Carnivora, Canidae, Canis, and lupus. Notice that each name is capitalized except for species, and\nthe genus and species names are italicized. Scientists generally refer to an organism only by its genus and species, which is\n812\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nits two-word scientific name, in what is called binomial nomenclature. Therefore, the scientific name of the dog is Canis\nlupus. The name at each level is also called a taxon. In other words, dogs are in order Carnivora. Carnivora is the name of\nthe taxon at the order level; Canidae is the taxon at the family level, and so forth. Organisms also have a common name\nthat people typically use, in this case, dog. Note that the dog is additionally a subspecies: the \u201cfamiliaris\u201d in Canis lupus\nfamiliaris. Subspecies are members of the same species that are capable of mating and reproducing viable offspring, but\nthey are considered separate subspecies due to geographic or behavioral isolation or other factors.\nFigure 20.6 shows how the levels move toward specificity with other organisms. Notice how the dog shares a domain\nwith the widest diversity of organisms, including plants and butterflies. At each sublevel, the organisms become more\nsimilar because they are more closely related. Historically, scientists classified organisms using characteristics, but as DNA\ntechnology developed, more precise phylogenies have been determined.\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\n813\nFigure 20.6 At each sublevel in the taxonomic classification system, organisms become more similar. Dogs\nand wolves are the same species because they can breed and produce viable offspring, but they are different\nenough to be classified as different subspecies.

        "summary": "Organizing Life on Earth focuses on how scientists classify and study the diversity of life by examining evolutionary relationships. Phylogeny refers to the evolutionary history of organisms, often represented by phylogenetic trees, which are hypotheses illustrating evolutionary pathways derived from evidence such as fossils, morphology, and DNA analysis. These trees can be rooted, showing a common ancestor, or unrooted, showing relationships without indicating ancestry, and include features like branch points, sister taxa, and polytomies. While taxonomy\u2014the hierarchical classification system from domain to species\u2014is used to organize life, modern approaches increasingly incorporate phylogenetic information to reflect evolutionary history. Classification systems, such as the three-domain model (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya), are updated as new data emerges; organisms are named using binomial nomenclature, and classification levels (taxa) become more specific down the hierarchy. The section also notes the limitations of phylogenetic trees, including that appearance does not always reflect relatedness, branch lengths often do not indicate time, and convergent evolution can create misleading similarities."

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 1.15][APLO 1.16][APLO 1.18][APLO 1.17][APLO 1.19][APLO 1.26]\nTwo Options for Similarities\nIn general, organisms that share similar physical features and genomes tend to be more closely related than those that do\nnot. Such features that overlap both morphologically (in form) and genetically are referred to as homologous structures;\nthey stem from developmental similarities that are based on evolution. For example, the bones in the wings of bats and birds\nhave homologous structures (Figure 20.7).\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\n817\nFigure 20.7 Bat and bird wings are homologous structures, indicating that bats and birds share a common evolutionary\npast. (credit a: modification of work by Steve Hillebrand, USFWS; credit b: modification of work by U.S. DOI BLM)\nNotice it is not simply a single bone, but rather a grouping of several bones arranged in a similar way. The more complex\nthe feature, the more likely any kind of overlap is due to a common evolutionary past. Imagine two people from different\ncountries both inventing a car with all the same parts and in exactly the same arrangement without any previous or shared\nknowledge. That outcome would be highly improbable. However, if two people both invented a hammer, it would be\nreasonable to conclude that both could have the original idea without the help of the other. The same relationship between\ncomplexity and shared evolutionary history is true for homologous structures in organisms.\nMisleading Appearances\nSome organisms may be very closely related, even though a minor genetic change caused a major morphological difference\nto make them look quite different. Similarly, unrelated organisms may be distantly related, but appear very much alike. This\nusually happens because both organisms were in common adaptations that evolved within similar environmental conditions.\nWhen similar characteristics occur because of environmental constraints and not due to a close evolutionary relationship,\nit is called an analogy or homoplasy. For example, insects use wings to fly like bats and birds, but the wing structure and\nembryonic origin is completely different. These are called analogous structures (Figure 20.8).\nSimilar traits can be either homologous or analogous. Homologous structures share a similar embryonic origin; analogous\norgans have a similar function. For example, the bones in the front flipper of a whale are homologous to the bones in the\nhuman arm. These structures are not analogous. The wings of a butterfly and the wings of a bird are analogous but not\nhomologous. Some structures are both analogous and homologous: the wings of a bird and the wings of a bat are both\nhomologous and analogous. Scientists must determine which type of similarity a feature exhibits to decipher the phylogeny\nof the organisms being studied.\n818\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 20.8 The (c) wing of a honeybee is similar in shape to a (b) bird wing and (a) bat wing, and it serves the same\nfunction. However, the honeybee wing is not composed of bones and has a distinctly different structure and embryonic\norigin. These wing types (insect versus bat and bird) illustrate an analogy\u2014similar structures that do not share an\nevolutionary history. (credit a: modification of work by Steve Hillebrand, USFWS; credit b: modification of work by U.S.\nDOI BLM; credit c: modification of work by Jon Sullivan)\nThis website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/relationships) has several examples to show how appearances can be\nmisleading in understanding the phylogenetic relationships of organisms.\nJames Lake of the UCLA/NASA Astrobiology Institute presented new evidence regarding the evolution of eukaryotic\ncells. He hypothesized that eukaryotes developed from an endosymbiotic gene fusion between the two other domains\nof life. What kind of genetic evidence would best support this hypothesis?\na.\nTheir mitochondrial DNA resembles that of other eukaryotes.\nb.\nThe chloroplasts of eukaryotes contain a double cell layer.\nc.\nAll eukaryotic genes are identical to either Archaea or Bacteria.\nd.\nSome eukaryotic genes resemble those of Archaea, while some resemble those of Bacteria and some are\nunlike the genes of either domain.\nMolecular Comparisons\nWith the advancement of DNA technology, the area of molecular systematics, which describes the use of information\non the molecular level including DNA analysis, has blossomed. New computer programs not only confirm many earlier\nclassified organisms, but also uncover previously made errors. As with physical characteristics, even the DNA sequence can\nbe tricky to read in some cases. For some situations, two very closely related organisms can appear unrelated if a mutation\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\n819\noccurred that caused a shift in the genetic code. An insertion or deletion mutation would move each nucleotide base over\none place, causing two similar codes to appear unrelated.\nSometimes two segments of DNA code in distantly related organisms randomly share a high percentage of bases in\nthe same locations, causing these organisms to appear closely related when they are not. For both of these situations,\ncomputer technologies have been developed to help identify the actual relationships, and, ultimately, the coupled use of\nboth morphologic and molecular information is more effective in determining phylogeny.\n820\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nWhy Does Phylogeny Matter?\nEvolutionary biologists could list many reasons why understanding phylogeny is important to everyday life\nin human society. For botanists, phylogeny acts as a guide to discovering new plants that can be used to\nbenefit people. Think of all the ways humans use plants\u2014food, medicine, and clothing are a few examples.\nIf a plant contains a compound that is effective in treating diseases, scientists might want to examine all of\nthe relatives of that plant for other useful drugs.\nA research team in China identified a segment of DNA thought to be common to some medicinal plants\nin the family Fabaceae (the legume family) and worked to identify which species had this segment\n(Figure 20.9). After testing plant species in this family, the team found a DNA marker (a known location\non a chromosome that enabled them to identify the species) present. Then, using the DNA to uncover\nphylogenetic relationships, the team could identify whether a newly discovered plant was in this family and\nassess its potential medicinal properties.\nFigure 20.9 Dalbergia sissoo (D. sissoo) is in the Fabaceae, or legume family. Scientists found that D. sissoo\nshares a DNA marker with species within the Fabaceae family that have antifungal properties. Subsequently, D.\nsissoo was shown to have fungicidal activity, supporting the idea that DNA markers can be used to screen for\nplants with potential medicinal properties.\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\n821\nPart b of the figure shows a hypothetical model of the evolution of the cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria,\nwhich has a double membrane. If this hypothesis is true, what does it suggest about the evolution of mitochondria and\nchloroplasts in eukaryotic cells and why?\na.\nChloroplasts and mitochondria did not come about through endosymbiosis with gram-negative bacteria\nbecause these organelles have a single membrane.\nb.\nChloroplasts and mitochondria likely evolved later in eukaryotic cells, as these organelles show no\nsimilarities to prokaryotes.\nc.\nChloroplasts and mitochondria came about through endosymbiosis with Archaea and gram positive bacteria\nbecause these organelles have prokaryote-like DNA.\nd.\nChloroplasts and mitochondria came about through endosymbiosis with gram-negative bacteria because\nthese organelles have a double membrane.\nBuilding Phylogenetic Trees\nHow do scientists construct phylogenetic trees? After the homologous and analogous traits are sorted, scientists often\norganize the homologous traits using a system called cladistics. This system sorts organisms into clades: groups of\norganisms that descended from a single ancestor. For example, in Figure 20.10, all of the organisms in the orange region\nevolved from a single ancestor that had amniotic eggs. Consequently, all of these organisms also have amniotic eggs and\nmake a single clade, also called a monophyletic group. Clades must include all of the descendants from a branch point.\n822\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 20.10 Lizards, rabbits, and humans all descend from a common ancestor that had an amniotic egg. Thus,\nlizards, rabbits, and humans all belong to the clade Amniota. Vertebrata is a larger clade that also includes fish\nand lamprey.\nEukaryotic mitochondria contain their own DNA, known as mitochondrial DNA, or mtDNA. Nuclear and\nmitochondrial DNA are thought to be of different (separate) evolutionary origin, with the mitochondrial DNA being\nderived from the circular chromosomes of bacteria that were engulfed by ancient prokaryotic cells. Does the presence\nof mitochondrial DNA suggest that organisms share many conserved core processes and features that evolved and are\nwidely distributed among organisms today? Why or why not?\na.\nYes, because it shows the prokaryotes and eukaryotes use similar organelles, namely, mitochondria.\nb.\nYes, because it suggests the eukaryotes possess traits that were likely conserved from prokaryotic ancestors.\nc.\nNo, because mitochondrial DNA is very different from the DNA within a eukaryote\u2019s nucleus.\nd.\nNo, because mitochondrial DNA is not used by the eukaryotic cells.\nClades can vary in size depending on which branch point is being referenced. The important factor is that all of the\norganisms in the clade or monophyletic group stem from a single point on the tree. This can be remembered because\nmonophyletic breaks down into \u201cmono,\u201d meaning one, and \u201cphyletic,\u201d meaning evolutionary relationship. Figure 20.11\nshows various examples of clades. Notice how each clade comes from a single point, whereas the non-clade groups show\nbranches that do not share a single point.\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\n823\nFigure 20.11 All the organisms within a clade stem from a single point on the tree. A clade may contain multiple\ngroups, as in the case of animals, fungi and plants, or a single group, as in the case of flagellates. Groups that\ndiverge at a different branch point, or that do not include all groups in a single branch point, are not considered\nclades.\nGlycolysis, or the breakdown of glucose, is a process used by almost all organisms as a way to release energy stored\nwithin glucose molecules. This energy can then be stored in cells as ATP, which powers cell processes when needed.\nWhat does this show, in terms of the evolutionary history of cells using glycolysis?\na.\nGlycolysis has been conserved despite the independent evolution of the three domains of life.\nb.\nProkaryotes would likely not benefit from the Krebs cycle or the ETC.\nc.\nProkaryotes likely evolved after eukaryotes.\nd.\nGlycolysis is the only way in which living things can break down glucose.\nShared Characteristics\nOrganisms evolve from common ancestors and then diversify. Scientists use the phrase \u201cdescent with modification\u201d because\neven though related organisms have many of the same characteristics and genetic codes, changes occur. This pattern repeats\nover and over as one goes through the phylogenetic tree of life:\n1.\nA change in the genetic makeup of an organism leads to a new trait which becomes prevalent in the group.\n2.\nMany organisms descend from this point and have this trait.\n3.\nNew variations continue to arise: some are adaptive and persist, leading to new traits.\n4.\nWith new traits, a new branch point is determined (go back to step 1 and repeat).\nIf a characteristic is found in the ancestor of a group, it is considered a shared ancestral character because all of the\norganisms in the taxon or clade have that trait. The vertebrate in Figure 20.10 is a shared ancestral character. Now consider\nthe amniotic egg characteristic in the same figure. Only some of the organisms in Figure 20.10 have this trait, and to those\nthat do, it is called a shared derived character because this trait derived at some point but does not include all of the\nancestors in the tree.\n824\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nThe tricky aspect to shared ancestral and shared derived characters is the fact that these terms are relative. The same trait\ncan be considered one or the other depending on the particular diagram being used. Returning to Figure 20.10, note that the\namniotic egg is a shared ancestral character for the Amniota clade, while having hair is a shared derived character for some\norganisms in this group. These terms help scientists distinguish between clades in the building of phylogenetic trees.\nChoosing the Right Relationships\nImagine being the person responsible for organizing all of the items in a department store properly\u2014an overwhelming task.\nOrganizing the evolutionary relationships of all life on Earth proves much more difficult: scientists must span enormous\nblocks of time and work with information from long-extinct organisms. Trying to decipher the proper connections,\nespecially given the presence of homologies and analogies, makes the task of building an accurate tree of life extraordinarily\ndifficult. Add to that the advancement of DNA technology, which now provides large quantities of genetic sequences to be\nused and analyzed. Taxonomy is a subjective discipline: many organisms have more than one connection to each other, so\neach taxonomist will decide the order of connections.\nTo aid in the tremendous task of describing phylogenies accurately, scientists often use a concept called maximum\nparsimony, which means that events occurred in the simplest, most obvious way. For example, if a group of people entered\na forest preserve to go hiking, based on the principle of maximum parsimony, one could predict that most of the people\nwould hike on established trails rather than forge new ones.\nFor scientists deciphering evolutionary pathways, the same idea is used: the pathway of evolution probably includes the\nfewest major events that coincide with the evidence at hand. Starting with all of the homologous traits in a group of\norganisms, scientists look for the most obvious and simple order of evolutionary events that led to the occurrence of those\ntraits.\nHead to this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32species) to learn how maximum parsimony is used to create\nphylogenetic trees.\nWhat do phylogenetic relationships refer to?\na.\nthe similarities among organisms\nb.\nthe differences among organisms\nc.\nthe evolution of the shape, size and number of body parts\nd.\nthe relative times in the past that species shared common ancestors\nThese tools and concepts are only a few of the strategies scientists use to tackle the task of revealing the evolutionary history\nof life on Earth.

        "summary": "Determining evolutionary relationships involves analyzing both morphological and molecular data to distinguish between homologous traits, which arise from shared ancestry, and analogous traits, which result from convergent evolution. Homologous structures share similar embryonic origins, while analogous structures have similar functions but different evolutionary histories. Scientists use cladistics to group organisms into clades based on shared derived traits, constructing phylogenetic trees or cladograms that depict evolutionary pathways. Molecular systematics, aided by DNA sequencing and computational tools, refines these relationships but can be complicated by mutations and similarities that arise by chance. Traits can be shared ancestral or shared derived depending on the evolutionary context, and maximum parsimony is applied to choose the simplest evolutionary explanations. Understanding phylogeny has practical applications in fields such as medicine, agriculture, and conservation, and ongoing advancements in technology continue to reveal surprising connections among species."

It is one of the most dynamic fields of study in all of\nbiology. Over the last several decades, new research has challenged scientists\u2019 ideas about how organisms are related. New\nmodels of these relationships have been proposed for consideration by the scientific community.\nMany phylogenetic trees have been shown as models of the evolutionary relationship among species. Phylogenetic trees\noriginated with Charles Darwin, who sketched the first phylogenetic tree in 1837 (Figure 20.12a), which served as a pattern\nfor subsequent studies for more than a century. The concept of a phylogenetic tree with a single trunk representing a\ncommon ancestor, with the branches representing the divergence of species from this ancestor, fits well with the structure\nof many common trees, such as the oak (Figure 20.12b). However, evidence from modern DNA sequence analysis and\nnewly developed computer algorithms has caused skepticism about the validity of the standard tree model in the scientific\ncommunity.\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\n827\nFigure 20.12 The (a) concept of the \u201ctree of life\u201d goes back to an 1837 sketch by Charles Darwin. Like an (b) oak\ntree, the \u201ctree of life\u201d has a single trunk and many branches. (credit b: modification of work by \"Amada44\"/Wikimedia\nCommons)\nLimitations to the Classic Model\nClassical thinking about prokaryotic evolution, included in the classic tree model, is that species evolve clonally. That is,\nthey produce offspring themselves with only random mutations causing the descent into the variety of modern-day and\nextinct species known to science. This view is somewhat complicated in eukaryotes that reproduce sexually, but the laws of\nMendelian genetics explain the variation in offspring, again, to be a result of a mutation within the species. The concept of\ngenes being transferred between unrelated species was not considered as a possibility until relatively recently. Horizontal\ngene transfer (HGT), also known as lateral gene transfer, is the transfer of genes between unrelated species. HGT has been\nshown to be an ever-present phenomenon, with many evolutionists postulating a major role for this process in evolution,\nthus complicating the simple tree model. Genes have been shown to be passed between species which are only distantly\nrelated using standard phylogeny, thus adding a layer of complexity to the understanding of phylogenetic relationships.\nThe various ways that HGT occurs in prokaryotes is important to understanding phylogenies. Although at present HGT\nis not viewed as important to eukaryotic evolution, HGT does occur in this domain as well. Finally, as an example of the\nultimate gene transfer, theories of genome fusion between symbiotic or endosymbiotic organisms have been proposed to\nexplain an event of great importance\u2014the evolution of the first eukaryotic cell, without which humans could not have come\ninto existence.\nHorizontal Gene Transfer\nHorizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the introduction of genetic material from one species to another species by mechanisms\nother than the vertical transmission from parent(s) to offspring. These transfers allow even distantly related species to share\ngenes, influencing their phenotypes. It is thought that HGT is more prevalent in prokaryotes, but that only about 2% of the\nprokaryotic genome may be transferred by this process. Some researchers believe such estimates are premature: the actual\nimportance of HGT to evolutionary processes must be viewed as a work in progress. As the phenomenon is investigated\nmore thoroughly, it may be revealed to be more common. Many scientists believe that HGT and mutation appear to be\n(especially in prokaryotes) a significant source of genetic variation, which is the raw material for the process of natural\nselection. These transfers may occur between any two species that share an intimate relationship (Table 20.1).\nSummary of Mechanisms of Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic HGT\nMechanism\nMode of Transmission\nExample\nProkaryotes transformation\nDNA uptake\nmany prokaryotes\ntransduction\nbacteriophage (virus)\nbacteria\nconjugation\npilus\nmany prokaryotes\nTable 20.1\n828\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nSummary of Mechanisms of Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic HGT\nMechanism\nMode of Transmission\nExample\ngene transfer agents phage-like particles\npurple non-sulfur bacteria\nEukaryotes\nfrom food organisms unknown\naphid\njumping genes\ntransposons\nrice and millet plants\nepiphytes/parasites\nunknown\nyew tree fungi\nfrom viral infections\nTable 20.1\nHGT in Prokaryotes\nThe mechanism of HGT has been shown to be quite common in the prokaryotic domains of Bacteria and Archaea,\nsignificantly changing the way their evolution is viewed. The majority of evolutionary models, such as in the Endosymbiont\nTheory, propose that eukaryotes descended from multiple prokaryotes, which makes HGT all the more important to\nunderstanding the phylogenetic relationships of all extant and extinct species.\nThe fact that genes are transferred among common bacteria is well known to microbiology students. These gene transfers\nbetween species are the major mechanism whereby bacteria acquire resistance to antibiotics. Classically, this type of transfer\nhas been thought to occur by three different mechanisms:\n1.\nTransformation: naked DNA is taken up by a bacteria\n2.\nTransduction: genes are transferred using a virus\n3.\nConjugation: the use a hollow tube called a pilus to transfer genes between organisms\nMore recently, a fourth mechanism of gene transfer between prokaryotes has been discovered. Small, virus-like particles\ncalled gene transfer agents (GTAs) transfer random genomic segments from one species of prokaryote to another. GTAs\nhave been shown to be responsible for genetic changes, sometimes at a very high frequency compared to other evolutionary\nprocesses. The first GTA was characterized in 1974 using purple, non-sulfur bacteria. These GTAs, which are thought to be\nbacteriophages that lost the ability to reproduce on their own, carry random pieces of DNA from one organism to another.\nThe ability of GTAs to act with high frequency has been demonstrated in controlled studies using marine bacteria. Gene\ntransfer events in marine prokaryotes, either by GTAs or by viruses, have been estimated to be as high as 1013 per year in\nthe Mediterranean Sea alone. GTAs and viruses are thought to be efficient HGT vehicles with a major impact on prokaryotic\nevolution.\nAs a consequence of this modern DNA analysis, the idea that eukaryotes evolved directly from Archaea has fallen out of\nfavor. While eukaryotes share many features that are absent in bacteria, such as the TATA box (found in the promoter region\nof many genes), the discovery that some eukaryotic genes were more homologous with bacterial DNA than Archaea DNA\nmade this idea less tenable. Furthermore, the fusion of genomes from Archaea and Bacteria by endosymbiosis has been\nproposed as the ultimate event in eukaryotic evolution.\nHGT in Eukaryotes\nAlthough it is easy to see how prokaryotes exchange genetic material by HGT, it was initially thought that this process\nwas absent in eukaryotes. After all, prokaryotes are but single cells exposed directly to their environment, whereas the\nsex cells of multicellular organisms are usually sequestered in protected parts of the body. It follows from this idea that\nthe gene transfers between multicellular eukaryotes should be more difficult. Indeed, it is thought that this process is\nrarer in eukaryotes and has a much smaller evolutionary impact than in prokaryotes. In spite of this fact, HGT between\ndistantly related organisms has been demonstrated in several eukaryotic species, and it is possible that more examples will\nbe discovered in the future.\nIn plants, gene transfer has been observed in species that cannot cross-pollinate by normal means. Transposons or \u201cjumping\ngenes\u201d have been shown to transfer between rice and millet plant species. Furthermore, fungal species feeding on yew trees,\nfrom which the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel is derived from the bark, have acquired the ability to make paclitaxel themselves,\na clear example of gene transfer.\nIn animals, a particularly interesting example of HGT occurs within the aphid species (Figure 20.13). Aphids are insects\nthat vary in color based on carotenoid content. Carotenoids are pigments made by a variety of plants, fungi, and microbes,\nand they serve a variety of functions in animals, who obtain these chemicals from their food. Humans require carotenoids\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\n829\nto synthesize vitamin A, and we obtain them by eating orange fruits and vegetables: carrots, apricots, mangoes, and sweet\npotatoes. On the other hand, aphids have acquired the ability to make the carotenoids on their own. According to DNA\nanalysis, this ability is due to the transfer of fungal genes into the insect by HGT, presumably as the insect consumed fungi\nfor food. A carotenoid enzyme called a desaturase is responsible for the red coloration seen in certain aphids, and it has\nbeen further shown that when this gene is inactivated by mutation, the aphids revert back to their more common green color\n(Figure 20.13).\nFigure 20.13 (a) Red aphids get their color from red carotenoid pigment. Genes necessary to make this pigment are\npresent in certain fungi, and scientists speculate that aphids acquired these genes through HGT after consuming fungi\nfor food. If genes for making carotenoids are inactivated by mutation, the aphids revert back to (b) their green color.\nRed coloration makes the aphids a lot more conspicuous to predators, but evidence suggests that red aphids are more\nresistant to insecticides than green ones. Thus, red aphids may be more fit to survive in some environments than green\nones.

This occurs when one species is taken inside the cytoplasm of another species,\nwhich ultimately results in a genome consisting of genes from both the endosymbiont and the host. This mechanism is an\naspect of the Endosymbiont Theory, which is accepted by a majority of biologists as the mechanism whereby eukaryotic\ncells obtained their mitochondria and chloroplasts. However, the role of endosymbiosis in the development of the nucleus is\nmore controversial. Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA are thought to be of different (separate) evolutionary origin, with the\nmitochondrial DNA being derived from the circular genomes of bacteria that were engulfed by ancient prokaryotic cells.\nMitochondrial DNA can be regarded as the smallest chromosome. Interestingly enough, mitochondrial DNA is inherited\nonly from the mother. The mitochondrial DNA degrades in sperm when the sperm degrades in the fertilized egg or in other\ninstances when the mitochondria located in the flagellum of the sperm fails to enter the egg.\nWithin the past decade, the process of genome fusion by endosymbiosis has been proposed by James Lake of the UCLA/\nNASA Astrobiology Institute to be responsible for the evolution of the first eukaryotic cells (Figure 20.15a). Using\nDNA analysis and a new mathematical algorithm called conditioned reconstruction (CR), his laboratory proposed that\neukaryotic cells developed from an endosymbiotic gene fusion between two species, one an Archaea and the other a\nBacteria. As mentioned, some eukaryotic genes resemble those of Archaea, whereas others resemble those from Bacteria.\nAn endosymbiotic fusion event, such as Lake has proposed, would clearly explain this observation. On the other hand, this\nwork is new and the CR algorithm is relatively unsubstantiated, which causes many scientists to resist this hypothesis.\nMore recent work by Lake (Figure 20.15b) proposes that gram-negative bacteria, which are unique within their domain\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\n831\nin that they contain two lipid bilayer membranes, indeed resulted from an endosymbiotic fusion of archaeal and bacterial\nspecies. The double membrane would be a direct result of the endosymbiosis, with the endosymbiont picking up the second\nmembrane from the host as it was internalized. This mechanism has also been used to explain the double membranes\nfound in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Lake\u2019s work is not without skepticism, and the ideas are still debated within the\nbiological science community. In addition to Lake\u2019s hypothesis, there are several other competing theories as to the origin\nof eukaryotes. How did the eukaryotic nucleus evolve? One theory is that the prokaryotic cells produced an additional\nmembrane that surrounded the bacterial chromosome. Some bacteria have the DNA enclosed by two membranes; however,\nthere is no evidence of a nucleolus or nuclear pores. Other proteobacteria also have membrane-bound chromosomes. If the\neukaryotic nucleus evolved this way, we would expect one of the two types of prokaryotes to be more closely related to\neukaryotes.\nFigure 20.15 The theory that mitochondria and chloroplasts are endosymbiotic in origin is now widely accepted. More\ncontroversial is the proposal that (a) the eukaryotic nucleus resulted from the fusion of archaeal and bacterial genomes,\nand that (b) Gram-negative bacteria, which have two membranes, resulted from the fusion of Archaea and Gram-\npositive bacteria, each of which has a single membrane.\nThe nucleus-first hypothesis proposes that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first (Figure 20.16a), followed by a later\nfusion of the new eukaryote with bacteria that became mitochondria. The mitochondria-first hypothesis proposes that\nmitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host (Figure 20.16b), which subsequently acquired a nucleus, by fusion\nor other mechanisms, to become the first eukaryotic cell. Most interestingly, the eukaryote-first hypothesis proposes that\nprokaryotes actually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity (Figure 20.16c). All of these hypotheses are\ntestable. Only time and more experimentation will determine which hypothesis is best supported by data.\n832\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 20.16 Three alternate hypotheses of eukaryotic and prokaryotic evolution are (a) the nucleus-first hypothesis,\n(b) the mitochondrion-first hypothesis, and (c) the eukaryote-first hypothesis.\nWeb and Network Models\nThe recognition of the importance of HGT, especially in the evolution of prokaryotes, has caused some to propose\nabandoning the classic \u201ctree of life\u201d model. In 1999, W. Ford Doolittle proposed a phylogenetic model that resembles a\nweb or a network more than a tree. The hypothesis is that eukaryotes evolved not from a single prokaryotic ancestor, but\nfrom a pool of many species that were sharing genes by HGT mechanisms. As shown in Figure 20.17a, some individual\nprokaryotes were responsible for transferring the bacteria that caused mitochondrial development to the new eukaryotes,\nwhereas other species transferred the bacteria that gave rise to chloroplasts. This model is often called the \u201cweb of life.\u201d In\nan effort to save the tree analogy, some have proposed using the Ficus tree (Figure 20.17b) with its multiple trunks as a\nphylogenetic to represent a diminished evolutionary role for HGT.\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\n833\nFigure 20.17 In the (a) phylogenetic model proposed by W. Ford Doolittle, the \u201ctree of life\u201d arose from a community\nof ancestral cells, has multiple trunks, and has connections between branches where horizontal gene transfer has\noccurred. Visually, this concept is better represented by (b) the multi-trunked Ficus than by the single trunk of the oak\nsimilar to the tree drawn by Darwin Figure 20.12. (credit b: modification of work by \"psyberartist\"/Flickr)\nRing of Life Models\nOthers have proposed abandoning any tree-like model of phylogeny in favor of a ring structure, the so-called \u201cring of\nlife\u201d (Figure 20.18); a phylogenetic model where all three domains of life evolved from a pool of primitive prokaryotes.\nLake, again using the conditioned reconstruction algorithm, proposes a ring-like model in which species of all three\ndomains\u2014Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya\u2014evolved from a single pool of gene-swapping prokaryotes. His laboratory\nproposes that this structure is the best fit for data from extensive DNA analyses performed in his laboratory, and that the\nring model is the only one that adequately takes HGT and genomic fusion into account. However, other phylogeneticists\nremain highly skeptical of this model.\nFigure 20.18 According to the \u201cring of life\u201d phylogenetic model, the three domains of life evolved from a pool of primitive\nprokaryotes.\nIn summary, the \u201ctree of life\u201d model proposed by Darwin must be modified to include HGT. Does this mean abandoning the\ntree model completely? Even Lake argues that all attempts should be made to discover some modification of the tree model\nto allow it to accurately fit his data, and only the inability to do so will sway people toward his ring proposal.\n834\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nThis doesn\u2019t mean a tree, web, or a ring will correlate completely to an accurate description of phylogenetic relationships\nof life. A consequence of the new thinking about phylogenetic models is the idea that Darwin\u2019s original conception of the\nphylogenetic tree is too simple, but made sense based on what was known at the time. However, the search for a more\nuseful model moves on: each model serving as hypotheses to be tested with the possibility of developing new models. This\nis how science advances. These models are used as visualizations to help construct hypothetical evolutionary relationships\nand understand the massive amount of data being analyzed.\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\n835\nanalogy\nbasal taxon\nbinomial nomenclature\nbranch point\ncladistics\ncladograms\nclass\neukaryote-first hypothesis\nfamily\ngene transfer agent (GTA)\ngenome fusion\ngenus\nhorizontal gene transfer (HGT)\nkingdom\nmaximum parsimony\nmitochondria-first hypothesis\nmolecular systematics\nmonophyletic group\nnucleus-first hypothesis\norder\nparsimony\nphylogenetic tree\nphylogeny\nphylum\npolytomy\nring of life\nrooted\nshared ancestral character\nshared derived character\nKEY TERMS\n(also, homoplasy) characteristic that is similar between organisms by convergent evolution, not due to the same\nevolutionary path\nbranch on a phylogenetic tree that has not diverged significantly from the root ancestor\nsystem of two-part scientific names for an organism, which includes genus and species names\nnode on a phylogenetic tree where a single lineage splits into distinct new ones\nsystem used to organize homologous traits to describe phylogenies\nvisual representations of evolutionary relationships between organisms\ndivision of phylum in the taxonomic classification system\nproposal that prokaryotes evolved from eukaryotes\ndivision of order in the taxonomic classification system\nbacteriophage-like particle that transfers random genomic segments from one species of\nprokaryote to another\nfusion of two prokaryotic genomes, presumably by endosymbiosis\ndivision of family in the taxonomic classification system; the first part of the binomial scientific name\n(also, lateral gene transfer) transfer of genes between unrelated species\ndivision of domain in the taxonomic classification system\napplying the simplest, most obvious way with the least number of steps\nproposal that prokaryotes acquired a mitochondrion first, followed by nuclear\ndevelopment\ntechnique using molecular evidence to identify phylogenetic relationships\n(also, clade) organisms that share a single ancestor\nproposal that prokaryotes acquired a nucleus first, and then the mitochondrion\ndivision of class in the taxonomic classification system\nthe simplest, most straightforward way of constructing phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships between\norganisms\ndiagram used to reflect the evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms\nevolutionary history and relationship of an organism or group of organisms\n(plural: phyla) division of kingdom in the taxonomic classification system\nbranch on a phylogenetic tree with more than two groups or taxa\nphylogenetic model where all three domains of life evolved from a pool of primitive prokaryotes\nsingle ancestral lineage on a phylogenetic tree to which all organisms represented in the diagram relate\ndescribes a characteristic on a phylogenetic tree that is shared by all organisms on the tree\ndescribes a characteristic on a phylogenetic tree that is shared only by a certain clade of\n836\nChapter 20 | Phylogenies and the History of Life\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nsister taxa\nsystematics\ntaxon\ntaxonomic classification system\ntaxonomy\nweb of life\norganisms\ntwo lineages that diverged from the same branch point\nfield of organizing and classifying organisms based on evolutionary relationships\n(plural: taxa) single level in the taxonomic classification system\nhierarchical system of classifying organisms, including the classification of domain,\nkingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species\nscience of classifying organisms\nphylogenetic model that attempts to incorporate the effects of horizontal gene transfer on evolution",
        "summary": "The section discusses how modern discoveries, especially horizontal gene transfer (HGT), have challenged the classic Darwinian \u201ctree of life\u201d model of phylogeny. HGT, the movement of genes between unrelated species, is common in prokaryotes\u2014occurring through transformation, transduction, conjugation, and gene transfer agents\u2014and has been shown to play a major role in bacterial evolution, including antibiotic resistance. Though rarer in eukaryotes, HGT has been documented in plants, fungi, and animals, such as aphids acquiring pigment-making genes from fungi. Genome fusion through endosymbiosis, central to the evolution of mitochondria and chloroplasts, may also explain the origin of the first eukaryotic cells, with competing hypotheses about whether the nucleus, mitochondria, or eukaryotes themselves arose first. The prevalence of HGT has inspired alternative phylogenetic models, such as web-like or multi-trunked trees, and the \u201cring of life,\u201d which depicts all life emerging from a pool of primitive, gene-swapping prokaryotes. While Darwin\u2019s original tree model is now seen as overly simplistic, researchers continue refining or replacing it to better represent evolutionary relationships in light of genetic exchange and genomic fusion."

Like many other diseases, it begins with a fever, runny nose, and sore throat. Soon after, a\nrash begins to cover the body. In about 30% of measles cases other complications develop, such as pneumonia, encephalitis\n(swelling of the brain), and even death. Though the first recorded account of the measles was in the 9th century, it was not\nuntil 1912 that healthcare providers in the United States began reporting cases. Between 1912 and 1922, there were over\n6,000 deaths related to the measles. This trend continued until 1963, when the first measles vaccine became available. The\nmeasles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000 primarily due to the fact that the vast majority of children\nwere receiving two doses of the vaccine. On January 23, 2015, the Center for Disease Control issued a health advisory about\nan outbreak of measles in several states . The outbreak originated at a popular theme park in California in December 2014\nwhen an infected tourist from another country visited the theme park. Many of the people who became infected were not\nvaccinated or had not received the second dose of the vaccination. You can read more about the health advisory at the CDC\nwebsite (http://Openstaxcollege.org/l/32measles) .\nNo one knows exactly when viruses emerged or from where they came, since viruses do not leave historical footprints such\nas fossils. Modern viruses are thought to be a mosaic of bits and pieces of nucleic acids picked up from various sources\nalong their respective evolutionary paths. Viruses are acellular, parasitic entities that are not classified within any kingdom.\nUnlike most living organisms, viruses are not cells and cannot divide. Instead, they infect a host cell and use the host\u2019s\nreplication processes to produce identical progeny virus particles. Viruses infect organisms as diverse as bacteria, plants,\nand animals. They exist in a netherworld between a living organism and a nonliving entity. Living things grow, metabolize,\nand reproduce. Viruses replicate, but to do so, they are entirely dependent on their host cells. They do not metabolize or\ngrow, but are assembled in their mature form.\nChapter 21 | Viruses\n849\n21.1 | Viral Evolution, Morphology, and Classification\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow were viruses first discovered and how are they detected?\n\u2022\nWhat three hypotheses describe the evolution of viruses?\n\u2022\nWhat is the basic structure of a virus?\n\u2022\nHow are viruses classified?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe first organisms that originated about 3.5 billion years ago were prokaryotes that possessed the structures and metabolic\nprocesses associated with cells (refer to the Cell Structure chapter). As discussed in the chapter on cell structure, prokaryotic\ncells are much smaller than eukaryotic cells and inhabit just about every square inch of our planet, from the most\ninhospitable environments to the surface of the skin. Viruses are much smaller than prokaryotes and much simpler in\nstructure. They must reproduce inside a host cell. Their origin is still a mystery to us, but we do know that they can make\nus very sick.\nViruses have a basic structure: a DNA or RNA core surrounded by an outer capsid of proteins. Some viruses have an\nouter phospholipid envelope. As we will explore in more detail, many viruses use some sort of glycoprotein to attach to\ntheir host cells. Viruses infect all known cell types and use the host cell\u2019s replication proteins and metabolic machinery to\nreplicate. Classification of viruses is challenging, but one method categorizes them based on how they produce their mRNA.\nRetroviruses (also called RNA viruses) use the enzyme reverse transcriptase to transcribe DNA from RNA. (In the Genes\nand Proteins chapter we learned that the usual flow of genetic information is from DNA to RNA to protein.) Common\nviruses include bacteriophage T4, adenovirus, and HIV retrovirus.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework. The AP\u00ae Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent\nfoundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP\u00ae exam\nquestions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.\nBig Idea 3\nLiving systems store, retrieve, transmit and respond to information essential to life\nprocesses.\nEnduring\nUnderstanding\n3.A\nHeritable information provides for continuity of life.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n3.A.1 DNA, and in some cases RNA, is the primary source of heritable information.\nScience\nPractice\n6.5 The student can evaluate alternative scientific explanations.\nLearning\nObjective\n3.1 The student is able to construct scientific explanations that use the structures and\nmechanisms of DNA and RNA to support the claim that DNA and, in some cases, that RNA\nare the primary sources of heritable information.\nThe Science Practice Challenge Questions contain additional test questions for this section that will help you prepare for\nthe AP exam. These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 2.20][APLO 3.3][APLO 3.29][APLO 3.30][APLO 2.22][APLO 2.26][APLO 1.31][APLO 1.27][APLO 1.30]\nDiscovery and Detection\nViruses were first discovered after the development of a porcelain filter, called the Chamberland-Pasteur filter, which could\nremove all bacteria visible in the microscope from any liquid sample. In 1886, Adolph Meyer demonstrated that a disease of\n850\nChapter 21 | Viruses\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\ntobacco plants, tobacco mosaic disease, could be transferred from a diseased plant to a healthy one via liquid plant extracts.\nIn 1892, Dmitri Ivanowski showed that this disease could be transmitted in this way even after the Chamberland-Pasteur\nfilter had removed all viable bacteria from the extract. Still, it was many years before it was proven that these \u201cfilterable\u201d\ninfectious agents were not simply very small bacteria but were a new type of very small, disease-causing particle.\nVirions, single virus particles, are very small, about 20\u2013250 nanometers in diameter. These individual virus particles are the\ninfectious form of a virus outside the host cell. Unlike bacteria (which are about 100-times larger), we cannot see viruses\nwith a light microscope, with the exception of some large virions of the poxvirus family. It was not until the development of\nthe electron microscope in the late 1930s that scientists got their first good view of the structure of the tobacco mosaic virus\n(TMV) (Figure 21.1) and other viruses (Figure 21.2). The surface structure of virions can be observed by both scanning\nand transmission electron microscopy, whereas the internal structures of the virus can only be observed in images from a\ntransmission electron microscope. The use of these technologies has allowed for the discovery of many viruses of all types\nof living organisms. They were initially grouped by shared morphology. Later, groups of viruses were classified by the type\nof nucleic acid they contained, DNA or RNA, and whether their nucleic acid was single- or double-stranded. More recently,\nmolecular analysis of viral replicative cycles has further refined their classification.\nFigure 21.2 In these transmission electron micrographs, (a) a virus is dwarfed by the bacterial cell it infects, while (b)\nthese E. coli cells are dwarfed by cultured colon cells.

Sears, unpub. data, CDC; scale-bar data from\nMatt Russell)\nEvolution of Viruses\nAlthough biologists have accumulated a significant amount of knowledge about how present-day viruses evolve, much\nless is known about how viruses originated in the first place. When exploring the evolutionary history of most organisms,\nscientists can look at fossil records and similar historic evidence. However, viruses do not fossilize, so researchers must\nconjecture by investigating how today\u2019s viruses evolve and by using biochemical and genetic information to create\nspeculative virus histories.\nWhile most findings agree that viruses don\u2019t have a single common ancestor, scholars have yet to find a single hypothesis\nabout virus origins that is fully accepted in the field. One such hypothesis, called devolution or the regressive hypothesis,\nproposes to explain the origin of viruses by suggesting that viruses evolved from free-living cells. However, many\ncomponents of how this process might have occurred are a mystery. A second hypothesis (called escapist or the progressive\nhypothesis) accounts for viruses having either an RNA or a DNA genome and suggests that viruses originated from RNA\nand DNA molecules that escaped from a host cell. A third hypothesis posits a system of self-replication similar to that of\nother self-replicating molecules, likely evolving alongside the cells they rely on as hosts; studies of some plant pathogens\nsupport this hypothesis.\nAs technology advances, scientists may develop and refine further hypotheses to explain the origin of viruses. The emerging\nfield called virus molecular systematics attempts to do just that through comparisons of sequenced genetic material. These\nChapter 21 | Viruses\n851\nresearchers hope to one day better understand the origin of viruses, a discovery that could lead to advances in the treatments\nfor the ailments they produce.\nViral Morphology\nViruses are acellular, meaning they are biological entities that do not have a cellular structure. They therefore lack most of\nthe components of cells, such as organelles, ribosomes, and the plasma membrane. A virion consists of a nucleic acid core,\nan outer protein coating or capsid, and sometimes an outer envelope made of protein and phospholipid membranes derived\nfrom the host cell. Viruses may also contain additional proteins, such as enzymes. The most obvious difference between\nmembers of viral families is their morphology, which is quite diverse. An interesting feature of viral complexity is that the\ncomplexity of the host does not correlate with the complexity of the virion. Some of the most complex virion structures are\nobserved in bacteriophages, viruses that infect the simplest living organisms, bacteria.\nMorphology\nViruses come in many shapes and sizes, but these are consistent and distinct for each viral family. All virions have a nucleic\nacid genome covered by a protective layer of proteins, called a capsid. The capsid is made up of protein subunits called\ncapsomeres. Some viral capsids are simple polyhedral \u201cspheres,\u201d whereas others are quite complex in structure.\nIn general, the shapes of viruses are classified into four groups: filamentous, isometric (or icosahedral), enveloped, and head\nand tail. Filamentous viruses are long and cylindrical. Many plant viruses are filamentous, including TMV. Isometric viruses\nhave shapes that are roughly spherical, such as poliovirus or herpesviruses. Enveloped viruses have membranes surrounding\ncapsids. Animal viruses, such as HIV, are frequently enveloped. Head and tail viruses infect bacteria and have a head that is\nsimilar to icosahedral viruses and a tail shape like filamentous viruses.\nMany viruses use some sort of glycoprotein to attach to their host cells via molecules on the cell called viral receptors\n(Figure 21.3). For these viruses, attachment is a requirement for later penetration of the cell membrane, so they can\ncomplete their replication inside the cell. The receptors that viruses use are molecules that are normally found on cell\nsurfaces and have their own physiological functions. Viruses have simply evolved to make use of these molecules for their\nown replication. For example, HIV uses the CD4 molecule on T lymphocytes as one of its receptors. CD4 is a type of\nmolecule called a cell adhesion molecule, which functions to keep different types of immune cells in close proximity to\neach other during the generation of a T lymphocyte immune response.\nFigure 21.3 The KSHV virus binds the xCT receptor on the surface of human cells. xCT receptors protect cells against\nstress. Stressed cells express more xCT receptors than non-stressed cells. The KSHV virion causes cells to become\nstressed, thereby increasing expression of the receptor to which it binds. (credit: modification of work by NIAID, NIH)\nAmong the most complex virions known, the T4 bacteriophage, which infects the Escherichia coli bacterium, has a tail\nstructure that the virus uses to attach to host cells and a head structure that houses its DNA.\nAdenovirus, a non-enveloped animal virus that causes respiratory illnesses in humans, uses glycoprotein spikes protruding\nfrom its capsomeres to attach to host cells. Non-enveloped viruses also include those that cause polio (poliovirus), plantar\n852\nChapter 21 | Viruses\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nwarts (papillomavirus), and hepatitis A (hepatitis A virus).\nEnveloped virions like HIV, the causative agent in AIDS, consist of nucleic acid (RNA in the case of HIV) and capsid\nproteins surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer envelope and its associated proteins. Glycoproteins embedded in the viral\nenvelope are used to attach to host cells. Other envelope proteins are the matrix proteins that stabilize the envelope and\noften play a role in the assembly of progeny virions. Chicken pox, influenza, and mumps are examples of diseases caused\nby viruses with envelopes. Because of the fragility of the envelope, non-enveloped viruses are more resistant to changes in\ntemperature, pH, and some disinfectants than enveloped viruses.\nOverall, the shape of the virion and the presence or absence of an envelope tell us little about what disease the virus may\ncause or what species it might infect, but they are still useful means to begin viral classification (Figure 21.4).\nFigure 21.4 Viruses can be either complex in shape or relatively simple. This figure shows three relatively\ncomplex virions: the bacteriophage T4, with its DNA-containing head group and tail fibers that attach to host cells;\nadenovirus, which uses spikes from its capsid to bind to host cells; and HIV, which uses glycoproteins embedded\nin its envelope to bind to host cells. Notice that HIV has proteins called matrix proteins, internal to the envelope,\nwhich help stabilize virion shape.

Viral genomes tend to be small, containing only\nthose genes that encode proteins that the virus cannot get from the host cell. This genetic material may be single- or double-\nstranded. It may also be linear or circular. While most viruses contain a single nucleic acid, others have genomes that have\nseveral, which are called segments.\nChapter 21 | Viruses\n853\nIn DNA viruses, the viral DNA directs the host cell\u2019s replication proteins to synthesize new copies of the viral genome\nand to transcribe and translate that genome into viral proteins. DNA viruses cause human diseases such as chickenpox and\nhepatitis B.\nRNA viruses contain only RNA as their genetic material. To replicate their genomes in the host cell, the RNA viruses\nencode enzymes that can replicate RNA into DNA, which cannot be done by the host cell. These RNA polymerase enzymes\nare more likely to make copying errors than DNA polymerases, and therefore often make mistakes during transcription. For\nthis reason, mutations in RNA viruses occur more frequently than in DNA viruses. This causes them to change and adapt\nmore rapidly to their host. Human diseases caused by RNA viruses include hepatitis C, measles, and rabies.\nVirus Classification\nTo understand the features shared among different groups of viruses, a classification scheme is necessary. As most viruses\nare not thought to have evolved from a common ancestor, however, the methods that scientists use to classify living things\nare not very useful. Biologists have used several classification systems in the past, based on the morphology and genetics\nof the different viruses. However, these earlier classification methods grouped viruses differently, based on which features\nof the virus they were using to classify them. The most commonly used classification method today is called the Baltimore\nclassification scheme and is based on how messenger RNA (mRNA) is generated in each particular type of virus.\nPast Systems of Classification\nViruses are classified in several ways: by factors such as their core content (Table 21.1 and Figure 21.3), the structure\nof their capsids, and whether they have an outer envelope. The type of genetic material (DNA or RNA) and its structure\n(single- or double-stranded, linear or circular, and segmented or non-segmented) are used to classify the virus core\nstructures.\nVirus Classification by Genome Structure and Core\nCore Classifications\nExamples\nRNA\nDNA\nRabies virus, retroviruses\nHerpesviruses, smallpox virus\nSingle-stranded\nDouble-stranded\nRabies virus, retroviruses\nHerpesviruses, smallpox virus\nLinear\nCircular\nRabies virus, retroviruses, herpesviruses,\nsmallpox virus\nPapillomaviruses, many bacteriophages\nNon-segmented: genome consists of a single segment of\ngenetic material\nSegmented: genome is divided into multiple segments\nParainfluenza viruses\nInfluenza viruses\nTable 21.1\n854\nChapter 21 | Viruses\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 21.5 Viruses are classified based on their core genetic material and capsid design. (a) Rabies virus has a\nsingle-stranded RNA (ssRNA) core and an enveloped helical capsid, whereas (b) variola virus, the causative agent of\nsmallpox, has a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) core and a complex capsid. Rabies transmission occurs when saliva\nfrom an infected mammal enters a wound. The virus travels through neurons in the peripheral nervous system to the\ncentral nervous system where it impairs brain function, and then travels to other tissues. The virus can infect any\nmammal, and most die within weeks of infection. Smallpox is a human virus transmitted by inhalation of the variola\nvirus, localized in the skin, mouth, and throat, which causes a characteristic rash. Before its eradication in 1979,\ninfection resulted in a 30\u201335 percent mortality rate.

Capsids are classified as naked\nicosahedral, enveloped icosahedral, enveloped helical, naked helical, and complex (Figure 21.6 and Figure 21.7). The type\nof genetic material (DNA or RNA) and its structure (single- or double-stranded, linear or circular, and segmented or non-\nsegmented) are used to classify the virus core structures (Table 21.2).\nFigure 21.6 Adenovirus (left) is depicted with a double-stranded DNA genome enclosed in an icosahedral capsid that\nis 90\u2013100 nm across.

In addition to the differences in morphology and genetics mentioned above, the Baltimore classification\nscheme groups viruses according to how the mRNA is produced during the replicative cycle of the virus.\nGroup I viruses contain double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) as their genome. Their mRNA is produced by transcription in\nmuch the same way as with cellular DNA. Group II viruses have single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as their genome. They\nconvert their single-stranded genomes into a dsDNA intermediate before transcription to mRNA can occur. Group III\nviruses use dsRNA as their genome. The strands separate, and one of them is used as a template for the generation of mRNA\nusing the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the virus. Group IV viruses have ssRNA as their genome with a\npositive polarity. Positive polarity means that the genomic RNA can serve directly as mRNA. Intermediates of dsRNA,\ncalled replicative intermediates, are made in the process of copying the genomic RNA. Multiple, full-length RNA strands\n856\nChapter 21 | Viruses\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nof negative polarity (complementary to the positive-stranded genomic RNA) are formed from these intermediates, which\nmay then serve as templates for the production of RNA with positive polarity, including both full-length genomic RNA\nand shorter viral mRNAs. Group V viruses contain ssRNA genomes with a negative polarity, meaning that their sequence\nis complementary to the mRNA. As with Group IV viruses, dsRNA intermediates are used to make copies of the genome\nand produce mRNA. In this case, the negative-stranded genome can be converted directly to mRNA. Additionally, full-\nlength positive RNA strands are made to serve as templates for the production of the negative-stranded genome. Group\nVI viruses have diploid (two copies) ssRNA genomes that must be converted, using the enzyme reverse transcriptase, to\ndsDNA; the dsDNA is then transported to the nucleus of the host cell and inserted into the host genome. Then, mRNA can\nbe produced by transcription of the viral DNA that was integrated into the host genome. Group VII viruses have partial\ndsDNA genomes and make ssRNA intermediates that act as mRNA, but are also converted back into dsDNA genomes by\nreverse transcriptase, necessary for genome replication. The characteristics of each group in the Baltimore classification are\nsummarized in Table 21.3 with examples of each group.\nBaltimore Classification\nGroup\nCharacteristics\nMode of mRNA Production\nExample\nI\nDouble-stranded\nDNA\nmRNA is transcribed directly from the DNA template\nHerpes simplex\n(herpesvirus)\nII\nSingle-stranded\nDNA\nDNA is converted to double-stranded form before RNA is\ntranscribed\nCanine\nparvovirus\n(parvovirus)\nIII\nDouble-stranded\nRNA\nmRNA is transcribed from the RNA genome\nChildhood\ngastroenteritis\n(rotavirus)\nIV\nSingle stranded\nRNA (+)\nGenome functions as mRNA\nCommon cold\n(pircornavirus)\nV\nSingle stranded\nRNA (-)\nmRNA is transcribed from the RNA genome\nRabies\n(rhabdovirus)\nVI\nSingle stranded\nRNA viruses with\nreverse\ntranscriptase\nReverse transcriptase makes DNA from the RNA\ngenome; DNA is then incorporated in the host genome;\nmRNA is transcribed from the incorporated DNA\nHuman\nimmunodeficiency\nvirus (HIV)\nVII\nDouble stranded\nDNA viruses with\nreverse\ntranscriptase\nThe viral genome is double-stranded DNA, but viral DNA\nis replicated through an RNA intermediate; the RNA may\nserve directly as mRNA or as a template to make mRNA\nHepatitis B virus\n(hepadnavirus)\nTable 21.3\n21.2 | Virus Infection and Hosts\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the steps in viral replication, and what events occur in each?\n\u2022\nWhat is the difference between the lytic and lysogenic cycles of virus replication?\n\u2022\nHow are plant and animal viruses transmitted, what are examples of virus-caused diseases in plants and animals,\nand what are the economic impacts of plant viruses?\nChapter 21 | Viruses\n857\n",
        "summary": "Viruses are acellular, nonliving entities that infect all forms of life and replicate only within host cells, using the host\u2019s machinery to produce new virions. First discovered in the late 19th century through filtration experiments on tobacco mosaic disease, their visualization and structural study became possible with electron microscopy. Viral origins remain uncertain, with three main hypotheses proposed: the regressive (originating from free-living cells), progressive (originating from mobile genetic elements), and coevolution hypotheses (arising alongside cells). Viruses vary widely in morphology but share a nucleic acid genome (DNA or RNA, single- or double-stranded, linear or circular, and sometimes segmented) enclosed in a protein capsid; some have a lipid envelope with glycoproteins for host cell attachment. Shapes fall into four main types\u2014filamentous, icosahedral, enveloped, and head-and-tail\u2014and complexity does not correlate with host complexity. Classification systems consider genome type and structure, capsid form, and the presence or absence of an envelope, with the Baltimore classification grouping viruses into seven classes based on their genetic material and mRNA production strategy. Examples range from bacteriophage T4 and adenovirus to HIV, influenza, and hepatitis viruses."

Group V viruses contain ssRNA genomes with a negative polarity, meaning that their sequence\nis complementary to the mRNA. As with Group IV viruses, dsRNA intermediates are used to make copies of the genome\nand produce mRNA. In this case, the negative-stranded genome can be converted directly to mRNA. Additionally, full-\nlength positive RNA strands are made to serve as templates for the production of the negative-stranded genome. Group\nVI viruses have diploid (two copies) ssRNA genomes that must be converted, using the enzyme reverse transcriptase, to\ndsDNA; the dsDNA is then transported to the nucleus of the host cell and inserted into the host genome.

Viruses replicate within a living host cell, producing\nchanges in the cell that often result in the death of the infected cell. Thus, viruses are considered intracellular parasites.\nViral replication involves several steps: attachment, penetration, replication, assembly, and release. Viruses are host-specific\nbecause they only can attach to and infect cells of certain organisms. Cells that a virus may use to replicate are called\npermissive. The virus attacks the host cell by first attaching to a specific receptor site on the membrane of the host cell.\nNext, the viral nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA, enters the host cell, either naked, leaving the protein capsid behind, or with\nthe capsid. If the capsid enters the cell, an additional uncoating step is needed. Viral nucleic acid then becomes available for\nreplication and transcription. The last stage of viral replication is the release of the new virions produced by the host that are\nable to infect other cells. Depending on the type of virus, the replication cycle facilitates the transfer of genetic information\nthrough the lytic and lysogenic cycles.\nBacteriophages, such as T4 are viruses that infect bacterial cells, can enter both the lytic and lysogenic cycles. Animal\nviruses cause a variety of infections, for example, hepatitis C, herpes, HPV, colds, and flu. Occasionally, viruses can \u201chide\u201d\nand remain latent (dormant) in cells such as nerve or liver cells for months, or even years; for example, the varicella-\nzoster virus that causes chickenpox in children can reactivate in adults to cause the painful condition known as \u201cshingles.\u201d\nOncogenic viruses in animals can cause cancer by interfering with the regulation of the host cell cycle. Plant viruses can\ncause considerable economic damage caused by poor crop quality and quantity globally.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework.

The viral replication cycle can produce dramatic biochemical and structural\nchanges in the host cell, which may cause cell damage. These changes, called cytopathic (causing cell damage) effects,\ncan change cell functions or even destroy the cell. Some infected cells, such as those infected by the common cold virus\nknown as rhinovirus, die through lysis (bursting) or apoptosis (programmed cell death), releasing all progeny virions at\nonce. The symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus, which attempts to control and eliminate\n858\nChapter 21 | Viruses\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nthe virus from the body, and from cell damage caused by the virus. Many animal viruses leave the infected cells of the\nimmune system by a process known as budding, where virions leave the cell individually. During the budding process, the\ncell does not undergo lysis and is not immediately killed. However, the damage to the cells that the virus infects may make\nit impossible for the cells to function normally, even though the cells remain alive for a period of time. Most productive\nviral infections follow similar steps in the virus replication cycle: attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly,\nand release (Figure 21.8).\nAttachment\nA virus attaches to a specific receptor site on the host cell membrane through attachment proteins in the capsid or via\nglycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope. The specificity of this interaction determines the host\u2014and the cells within\nthe host\u2014that can be infected by a particular virus. This can be illustrated by thinking of several keys and several locks,\nwhere each key will fit only one specific lock.\nThis video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/influenza) explains how influenza attacks the body.\nThe video shows how viruses replicate in our body. Using the terminology provided in the video, explain how a virus\nattaches to a cell in our body?\na.\nWhen the virus capsule makes contact with the cell, it bursts, and then the virions attach to the cell.\nb.\nIf a key on the virus fits a lock on the surface of the cell, the virus will attach to the cell.\nc.\nThe keys automatically attach to all the locks.\nd.\nThe welcoming committee interlocks with the virus.\nEntry\nThe nucleic acid of bacteriophages enters the host cell naked, leaving the capsid outside the cell. Plant and animal viruses\ncan enter through endocytosis, in which the cell membrane surrounds and engulfs the entire virus. Some enveloped viruses\nenter the cell when the viral envelope fuses directly with the cell membrane. Once inside the cell, the viral capsid is\ndegraded, and the viral nucleic acid is released, which then becomes available for replication and transcription.\nReplication and Assembly\nThe replication mechanism depends on the viral genome. DNA viruses usually use host cell proteins and enzymes to make\nadditional DNA that is transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then used to direct protein synthesis. RNA viruses\nusually use the RNA core as a template for synthesis of viral genomic RNA and mRNA. The viral mRNA directs the host\ncell to synthesize viral enzymes and capsid proteins, and assemble new virions. Of course, there are exceptions to this\npattern. If a host cell does not provide the enzymes necessary for viral replication, viral genes supply the information to\ndirect synthesis of the missing proteins. Retroviruses have an RNA genome that must be reverse transcribed into DNA,\nwhich then is incorporated into the host cell genome. They are within group VI of the Baltimore classification scheme.\nTo convert RNA into DNA, retroviruses must contain genes that encode the virus-specific enzyme reverse transcriptase\nthat transcribes an RNA template to DNA. Reverse transcription never occurs in uninfected host cells\u2014the needed enzyme\nreverse transcriptase is only derived from the expression of viral genes within the infected host cells. The fact that some\nretroviruses produces some of its own enzymes not found in the host has allowed researchers to develop drugs that\ninhibit these enzymes. These drugs inhibit replication by reducing the activity of the enzyme without affecting the host\u2019s\nmetabolism. This approach has led to the development of a variety of drugs used to treat these viruses and has been effective\nat reducing the number of infectious virions (copies of viral RNA) in the blood to non-detectable levels in people affected\nwith the virus.\nEgress\nThe last stage of viral replication is the release of the new virions produced in the host organism, where they are able to\nChapter 21 | Viruses\n859\ninfect adjacent cells and repeat the replication cycle. As you\u2019ve learned, some viruses are released when the host cell dies,\nand other viruses can leave infected cells by budding through the membrane without directly killing the cell.\nFigure 21.8 In influenza virus infection, glycoproteins attach to a host epithelial cell. As a result, the virus is\nengulfed. RNA and proteins are made and assembled into new virions.\nInfluenza virus is packaged in a viral envelope that fuses with the plasma membrane. This way, the virus can exit the\nhost cell without killing it.

This\nfeature of a virus makes it specific to one or a few species of life on Earth. On the other hand, so many different types\nof viruses exist on Earth that nearly every living organism has its own set of viruses that tries to infect its cells. Even the\nsmallest and simplest of cells, prokaryotic bacteria, may be attacked by specific types of viruses.\nBacteriophages\nFigure 21.9 This transmission electron micrograph shows bacteriophages attached to a bacterial cell. (credit:\nmodification of work by Dr. Graham Beards; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nBacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria (Figure 21.9). When infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the\nproduction of new virions, the infection is said to be productive. If the virions are released by bursting the cell, the virus\nreplicates by means of a lytic cycle (Figure 21.10). An example of a lytic bacteriophage is T4, which infects Escherichia\ncoli found in the human intestinal tract. Sometimes, however, a virus can remain within the cell without being released. For\nexample, when a temperate bacteriophage infects a bacterial cell, it replicates by means of a lysogenic cycle (Figure 21.10),\nand the viral genome is incorporated into the genome of the host cell. When the phage DNA is incorporated into the host\ncell genome, it is called a prophage. An example of a lysogenic bacteriophage is the \u03bb (lambda) virus, which also infects\nChapter 21 | Viruses\n861\nthe E. coli bacterium. Viruses that infect plant or animal cells may also undergo infections where they are not producing\nvirions for long periods. An example is the animal herpesviruses, including herpes simplex viruses, the cause of herpes in\nhumans. In a process called latency, these viruses can exist in nervous tissue for long periods of time without producing\nnew virions, only to leave latency periodically and cause lesions in the skin where the virus replicates. Even though there are\nsimilarities between lysogeny and latency, the term lysogenic cycle is usually reserved to describe bacteriophages. Latency\nwill be described in more detail below.\nFigure 21.10 A temperate bacteriophage has both lytic and lysogenic cycles. In the lytic cycle, the phage\nreplicates and lyses the host cell. In the lysogenic cycle, phage DNA is incorporated into the host genome,\nwhere it is passed on to subsequent generations. Environmental stressors such as starvation or exposure to toxic\nchemicals may cause the prophage to excise and enter the lytic cycle.\nWhich of the following statements is false?\na.\nIn the lytic cycle, new phage are produced and released into the environment.\nb.\nAn environmental stressor can cause the phage to initiate the lysogenic cycle.\nc.\nIn the lysogenic cycle, phage DNA is incorporated into the host genome.\nd.\nBacteriophage is a viruses that infects bacteria.\nAnimal Viruses\nAnimal viruses, unlike the viruses of plants and bacteria, do not have to penetrate a cell wall to gain access to the host cell.\nNon-enveloped or \u201cnaked\u201d animal viruses may enter cells in two different ways. As a protein in the viral capsid binds to\nits receptor on the host cell, the virus may be taken inside the cell via a vesicle during the normal cell process of receptor-\nmediated endocytosis. An alternative method of cell penetration used by non-enveloped viruses is for capsid proteins to\nundergo shape changes after binding to the receptor, creating channels in the host cell membrane. The viral genome is then\n\u201cinjected\u201d into the host cell through these channels in a manner analogous to that used by many bacteriophages. Enveloped\n862\nChapter 21 | Viruses\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nviruses also have two ways of entering cells after binding to their receptors: receptor-mediated endocytosis, or fusion. Many\nenveloped viruses enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis in a fashion similar to some non-enveloped viruses. On\nthe other hand, fusion only occurs with enveloped virions. These viruses, which include HIV among others, use special\nfusion proteins in their envelopes to cause the envelope to fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell, thus releasing the\ngenome and capsid of the virus into the cell cytoplasm.\nAfter making their proteins and copying their genomes, animal viruses complete the assembly of new virions and exit the\ncell Enveloped animal viruses may bud from the cell membrane as they assemble themselves, taking a piece of the cell\u2019s\nplasma membrane in the process. On the other hand, non-enveloped viral progeny, such as rhinoviruses, accumulate in\ninfected cells until there is a signal for lysis or apoptosis, and all virions are released together.\nAs you will learn in the next module, animal viruses are associated with a variety of human diseases. Some of them follow\nthe classic pattern of acute disease, where symptoms get increasingly worse for a short period followed by the elimination\nof the virus from the body by the immune system and eventual recovery from the infection. Examples of acute viral\ndiseases are the common cold and influenza. Other viruses cause long-term chronic infections, such as the virus causing\nhepatitis C, whereas others, like herpes simplex virus, only cause intermittent symptoms. Still other viruses, such as\nhuman herpesviruses 6 and 7, which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola, often successfully cause\nproductive infections without causing any symptoms at all in the host, and thus we say these patients have an asymptomatic\ninfection.\nIn hepatitis C infections, the virus grows and reproduces in liver cells, causing low levels of liver damage. The damage is\nso low that infected individuals are often unaware that they are infected, and many infections are detected only by routine\nblood work on patients with risk factors. On the other hand, since many of the symptoms of viral diseases are caused by\nimmune responses, a lack of symptoms is an indication of a weak immune response to the virus. This allows for the virus to\nescape elimination by the immune system and persist in individuals for years, all the while producing low levels of progeny\nvirions in what is known as a chronic viral disease.\nAs already discussed, herpes simplex virus can remain in a state of latency in nervous tissue for months, even years. As\nthe virus \u201chides\u201d in the tissue and makes few if any viral proteins, there is nothing for the immune response to act against,\nand immunity to the virus slowly declines. Under certain conditions, including various types of physical and psychological\nstress, the latent herpes simplex virus may be reactivated and undergo a lytic replication cycle in the skin, causing the lesions\nassociated with the disease. Once virions are produced in the skin and viral proteins are synthesized, the immune response\nis again stimulated and resolves the skin lesions in a few days by destroying viruses in the skin. As a result of this type\nof replicative cycle, appearances of cold sores outbreaks only occur intermittently, even though the viruses remain in the\nnervous tissue for life. Latent infections are common with other herpesviruses as well, including the varicella-zoster virus\nthat causes chickenpox. After having a chickenpox infection in childhood, the varicella-zoster virus can remain latent for\nmany years and reactivate in adults to cause the painful condition known as \u201cshingles\u201d (Figure 21.11ab).\nFigure 21.11 (a) Varicella-zoster, the virus that causes chickenpox, has an enveloped icosahedral capsid visible in this\ntransmission electron micrograph. Its double-stranded DNA genome becomes incorporated in the host DNA and can\nreactivate after latency in the form of (b) shingles, often exhibiting a rash.

Martin, CDC; credit b: modification of work by \u201crosmary\u201d/Flickr; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nSome animal-infecting viruses, including the hepatitis C virus discussed above, are known as oncogenic viruses: They\nhave the ability to cause cancer. These viruses interfere with the normal regulation of the host cell cycle either by either\nintroducing genes that stimulate unregulated cell growth (oncogenes) or by interfering with the expression of genes that\nChapter 21 | Viruses\n863\ninhibit cell growth. Oncogenic viruses can be either DNA or RNA viruses. Cancers known to be associated with viral\ninfections include cervical cancer caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) (Figure 21.12), liver cancer caused by hepatitis\nB virus, T-cell leukemia, and several types of lymphoma.\nFigure 21.12 HPV, or human papillomavirus, has a naked icosahedral capsid visible in this transmission electron\nmicrograph and a double-stranded DNA genome that is incorporated into the host DNA.

This process is sometimes referred\nto as _____.\na.\nviral attachment or adsorption\nb.\nviral entry\nc.\nuncoating\nd.\nviral replication\nPlant Viruses\nPlant viruses, like other viruses, contain a core of either DNA or RNA. You have already learned about one of these,\nthe tobacco mosaic virus. As plant cells have a cell wall to protect their cells, these viruses do not use receptor-mediated\nendocytosis to enter host cells as is seen with animal viruses. For many plant viruses to be transferred from plant to plant,\ndamage to some of the plants\u2019 cells must occur to allow the virus to enter a new host. This damage is often caused by\nweather, insects, animals, fire, or human activities like farming or landscaping. Additionally, plant offspring may inherit\n864\nChapter 21 | Viruses\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nviral diseases from parent plants. Plant viruses can be transmitted by a variety of vectors, through contact with an infected\nplant\u2019s sap, by living organisms such as insects and nematodes, and through pollen. When plants viruses are transferred\nbetween different plants, this is known as horizontal transmission, and when they are inherited from a parent, this is called\nvertical transmission.\nSymptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host (Table 21.4). One common symptom is hyperplasia, the\nabnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls. Other viruses induce hypoplasia,\nor decreased cell growth, in the leaves of plants, causing thin, yellow areas to appear. Still other viruses affect the plant by\ndirectly killing plant cells, a process known as cell necrosis. Other symptoms of plant viruses include malformed leaves,\nblack streaks on the stems of the plants, altered growth of stems, leaves, or fruits, and ring spots, which are circular or linear\nareas of discoloration found in a leaf.\nSome Common Symptoms of Plant Viral Diseases\nSymptom\nAppears as\nHyperplasia\nGalls (tumors)\nHypoplasia\nThinned, yellow splotches on leaves\nCell necrosis\nDead, blackened stems, leaves, or fruit\nAbnormal growth patterns Malformed stems, leaves, or fruit\nDiscoloration\nYellow, red, or black lines, or rings in stems, leaves, or fruit\nTable 21.4\nPlant viruses can seriously disrupt crop growth and development, significantly affecting our food supply.

Some viruses that infect agricultural food plants include the name of the plant\nthey infect, such as tomato spotted wilt virus, bean common mosaic virus, and cucumber mosaic virus. In plants used for\nlandscaping, two of the most common viruses are peony ring spot and rose mosaic virus. There are far too many plant\nviruses to discuss each in detail, but symptoms of bean common mosaic virus result in lowered bean production and stunted,\nunproductive plants. In the ornamental rose, the rose mosaic disease causes wavy yellow lines and colored splotches on the\nleaves of the plant.\nChapter 21 | Viruses\n865\nPlant viruses can be spread through sap, insects, organisms living in the soil, seeds, and pollen.

        "summary": "Viruses are intracellular parasites that replicate only within permissive host cells through a general cycle of attachment, entry, replication, assembly, and release, with variations depending on genome type and host. They exhibit high host and cell specificity, infecting organisms ranging from bacteria to plants and animals. Bacteriophages may follow a lytic cycle, producing and releasing virions by lysing the cell, or a lysogenic cycle, integrating their genome as a prophage until triggered to reenter the lytic phase. Animal viruses enter by endocytosis or membrane fusion, replicate using host or viral enzymes, and exit via budding or cell lysis, leading to acute, chronic, latent, or asymptomatic infections; some are oncogenic, disrupting cell cycle control. Plant viruses, hindered by cell walls, require physical damage or vectors for entry and can spread horizontally or vertically, causing symptoms like galls, leaf discoloration, necrosis, or malformation, with significant economic losses in agriculture and horticulture."

We explore some of these concepts when\nwe study the immune system. However, because all of us will fight viral infections and will receive vaccinations against\nmany diseases, including seasonal flu shots, the content in this section is relevant to our lives outside the classroom. While\nstudying, think about why there are many different antibiotics available for treating bacterial infections but relatively few\ndrugs available to treat viral infections. How do viruses differ from bacteria in both structure and activity?\nViruses cause a variety of diseases in animals, including humans, ranging from the common cold to potentially fatal illnesses\nlike meningitis (Figure 21.14). These diseases can be treated by antiviral drugs or by vaccines, but some viruses are capable\nof both avoiding the immune response and mutating to become resistant to antiviral drugs.\nFigure 21.14 Viruses can cause dozens of ailments in humans, ranging from mild illnesses to serious diseases. (credit:\nmodification of work by Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m)\nVaccines for Prevention\nWhile we do have limited numbers of effective antiviral drugs, such as those used to treat influenza, the primary method of\ncontrolling viral disease is by vaccination, which is intended to prevent outbreaks by building immunity to a virus or virus\nfamily (Figure 21.15). Vaccines may be prepared using live viruses, killed viruses, or molecular subunits of the virus. The\nkilled viral vaccines and subunit viruses are both incapable of causing disease.\nLive viral vaccines are designed in the laboratory to cause few symptoms in recipients while giving them protective\nimmunity against future infections. Polio was one disease that represented a milestone in the use of vaccines. Mass\nimmunization campaigns in the 1950s (killed vaccine) and 1960s (live vaccine) significantly reduced the incidence of the\ndisease, which caused muscle paralysis in children and generated a great amount of fear in the general population when\nregional epidemics occurred. The success of the polio vaccine paved the way for the routine dispensation of childhood\nvaccines against measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, and other diseases.\nThe danger of using live vaccines, which are usually more effective than killed vaccines, is the low but significant\ndanger that these viruses will revert to their disease-causing form by back mutations. Live vaccines are usually made\nby attenuating (weakening) the \u201cwild-type\u201d (disease-causing) virus by growing it in the laboratory in tissues or at\ntemperatures different from what the virus is accustomed to in the host. Adaptations to these new cells or temperatures\ninduce mutations in the genomes of the virus, allowing it to grow better in the laboratory while inhibiting its ability to cause\nChapter 21 | Viruses\n867\ndisease when reintroduced into conditions found in the host. These attenuated viruses thus still cause infection, but they do\nnot grow very well, allowing the immune response to develop in time to prevent major disease. Back mutations occur when\nthe vaccine undergoes mutations in the host such that it readapts to the host and can again cause disease, which can then be\nspread to other humans in an epidemic. This type of scenario happened as recently as 2007 in Nigeria where mutations in a\npolio vaccine led to an epidemic of polio in that country.\nSome vaccines are in continuous development because certain viruses, such as influenza, have a high mutation rate\ncompared to other viruses and normal host cells. With influenza, mutations in the surface molecules of the virus help the\norganism evade the protective immunity that may have been obtained in a previous influenza season, making it necessary\nfor individuals to get vaccinated every year. Other viruses, such as those that cause the childhood diseases measles, mumps,\nand rubella, mutate so infrequently that the same vaccine is used year after year.\nFigure 21.15 Vaccinations are designed to boost immunity to a virus to prevent infection.

The concept behind this is that by giving the\nvaccine, immunity is boosted without adding more disease-causing virus. In the case of rabies, a fatal neurological disease\ntransmitted via the saliva of rabies virus-infected animals, the progression of the disease from the time of the animal bite\n868\nChapter 21 | Viruses\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nto the time it enters the central nervous system may be 2 weeks or longer. This is enough time to vaccinate an individual\nwho suspects that they have been bitten by a rabid animal, and their boosted immune response is sufficient to prevent the\nvirus from entering nervous tissue. Thus, the potentially fatal neurological consequences of the disease are averted, and the\nindividual only has to recover from the infected bite. This approach is also being used for the treatment of Ebola, one of the\nfastest and most deadly viruses on earth. Transmitted by bats and great apes, this disease can cause death in 70\u201390 percent\nof infected humans within 2 weeks. Using newly developed vaccines that boost the immune response in this way, there is\nhope that affected individuals will be better able to control the virus, potentially saving a greater percentage of infected\npersons from a rapid and very painful death.\nAnother way of treating viral infections is the use of antiviral drugs. These drugs often have limited success in curing viral\ndisease, but in many cases, they have been used to control and reduce symptoms for a wide variety of viral diseases. For\nmost viruses, these drugs can inhibit the virus by blocking the actions of one or more of its proteins. It is important that the\ntargeted proteins be encoded by viral genes and that these molecules are not present in a healthy host cell. In this way, viral\ngrowth is inhibited without damaging the host. There are large numbers of antiviral drugs available to treat infections, some\nspecific for a particular virus and others that can affect multiple viruses.\nAntivirals have been developed to treat herpes and influenza. For herpes, drugs such as acyclovir can reduce the number\nand duration of episodes of active viral disease, during which patients develop viral lesions in their skin cells. As the virus\nremains latent in nervous tissue of the body for life, this drug is not curative but can make the symptoms of the disease more\nmanageable. For influenza, drugs like oseltamivir (Figure 21.16) can reduce the duration of \u201cflu\u201d symptoms by 1 or 2 days,\nbut the drug does not prevent symptoms entirely. Oseltamivir works by inhibiting an enzyme (viral neuraminidase) that\nallows new virions to leave their infected cells. Thus, Oseltamivir inhibits the spread of virus from infected to uninfected\ncells. Other antiviral drugs, such as Ribavirin, have been used to treat a variety of viral infections, although its mechanism\nof action against certain viruses remains unclear.\nFigure 21.16 (a) Oseltamivir inhibits a viral enzyme called neuraminidase (NA) found in the influenza viral envelope.\n(b) Neuraminidase cleaves the connection between viral hemagglutinin (HA), also found in the viral envelope, and\nglycoproteins on the host cell surface. Inhibition of neuraminidase prevents the virus from detaching from the host cell,\nthereby blocking further infection. (credit a: modification of work by M. Eickmann)\nBy far, the most successful use of antivirals has been in the treatment of the retrovirus HIV, which causes a disease that, if\nuntreated, is usually fatal within 10\u201312 years after infection. Anti-HIV drugs have been able to control viral replication to\nthe point that individuals receiving these drugs survive for a significantly longer time than the untreated.\nAnti-HIV drugs inhibit viral replication at many different phases of the HIV replicative cycle (Figure 21.17). Drugs\nhave been developed that inhibit the fusion of the HIV viral envelope with the plasma membrane of the host cell (fusion\ninhibitors), the conversion of its RNA genome into double-stranded DNA (reverse transcriptase inhibitors), the integration\nof the viral DNA into the host genome (integrase inhibitors), and the processing of viral proteins (protease inhibitors).\nChapter 21 | Viruses\n869\nFigure 21.17 HIV, an enveloped, icosahedral virus, attaches to the CD4 receptor of an immune cell and fuses with\nthe cell membrane. Viral contents are released into the cell, where viral enzymes convert the single-stranded RNA\ngenome into DNA and incorporate it into the host genome. (credit: NIAID, NIH)\nWhen any of these drugs are used individually, the high mutation rate of the virus allows it to easily and rapidly develop\nresistance to the drug, limiting the drug\u2019s effectiveness. The breakthrough in the treatment of HIV was the development\nof HAART, highly active antiretroviral therapy, which involves a mixture of different drugs, sometimes called a drug\n\u201ccocktail.\u201d By attacking the virus at different stages of its replicative cycle, it is much more difficult for the virus to develop\nresistance to multiple drugs at the same time. Still, even with the use of combination HAART therapy, there is concern that,\nover time, the virus will develop resistance to this therapy. Thus, new anti-HIV drugs are constantly being developed with\nthe hope of continuing the battle against this highly fatal virus.\n870\nChapter 21 | Viruses\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nApplied Virology\nThe study of viruses has led to the development of a variety of new ways to treat non-viral diseases.\nViruses have been used in gene therapy. Gene therapy is used to treat genetic diseases such as severe\ncombined immunodeficiency (SCID), a heritable, recessive disease in which children are born with severely\ncompromised immune systems. One common type of SCID is due to the lack of an enzyme, adenosine\ndeaminase (ADA), which breaks down purine bases. To treat this disease by gene therapy, bone marrow\ncells are taken from a SCID patient and the ADA gene is inserted. This is where viruses come in, and\ntheir use relies on their ability to penetrate living cells and bring genes in with them. Viruses such as\nadenovirus, an upper respiratory human virus, are modified by the addition of the ADA gene, and the virus\nthen transports this gene into the cell. The modified cells, now capable of making ADA, are then given\nback to the patients in the hope of curing them.

Still, many\ntechnological problems need to be solved for this approach to be a viable method for treating genetic\ndisease.\nAnother medical use for viruses relies on their specificity and ability to kill the cells they infect. Oncolytic\nviruses are engineered in the laboratory specifically to attack and kill cancer cells. A genetically modified\nadenovirus known as H101 has been used since 2005 in clinical trials in China to treat head and neck\ncancers. The results have been promising, with a greater short-term response rate to the combination of\nchemotherapy and viral therapy than to chemotherapy treatment alone.

        "summary": "Viral infections in humans range from mild illnesses to severe, potentially fatal diseases and are managed primarily through vaccination and, to a lesser extent, antiviral drugs. Vaccines, which may use live attenuated viruses, killed viruses, or viral subunits, work by building immunity to prevent outbreaks, though live vaccines carry a small risk of reverting to a disease-causing form. Some viruses, like influenza, mutate frequently, requiring regularly updated vaccines, while others, like measles, mutate slowly and use the same vaccine long-term. Vaccines can also treat certain active infections, such as rabies and Ebola, by boosting immunity before the virus causes severe damage. Antiviral drugs target virus-specific proteins to inhibit replication without harming host cells; examples include acyclovir for herpes, oseltamivir for influenza, and multi-drug HAART therapy for HIV to reduce mutation-driven resistance. Viruses are also used in applied medical treatments\u2014serving as vectors for gene therapy, selectively destroying cancer cells (oncolytic viruses), and as bacteriophages to combat antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections."

However, it\u2019s interesting to note that prions and\nviroids\u2014pathogens that are far simpler in structure than viruses\u2014can produce deadly diseases, including mad cow disease\nand Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease. Prions are infectious proteins, whereas viroids are single-stranded RNA pathogens (agents\nwith the ability to cause disease) that infect plants.\nPrions\nPrions, so-called because they are proteinaceous, are infectious particles\u2014smaller than viruses\u2014that contain no nucleic\nacids (neither DNA nor RNA). Historically, the idea of an infectious agent that did not use nucleic acids was considered\nimpossible, but pioneering work by Nobel Prize-winning biologist Stanley Prusiner has convinced the majority of biologists\nthat such agents do indeed exist.\nFatal neurodegenerative diseases, such as kuru in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle\n(commonly known as \u201cmad cow disease\u201d) were shown to be transmitted by prions. The disease was spread by the\nconsumption of meat, nervous tissue, or internal organs between members of the same species. Kuru, native to humans in\nPapua New Guinea, was spread from human to human via ritualistic cannibalism. BSE, originally detected in the United\nKingdom, was spread between cattle by the practice of including cattle nervous tissue in feed for other cattle. Individuals\nwith kuru and BSE show symptoms of loss of motor control and unusual behaviors, such as uncontrolled bursts of laughter\nwith kuru, followed by death. Kuru was controlled by inducing the population to abandon its ritualistic cannibalism.\nOn the other hand, BSE was initially thought to only affect cattle. Cattle dying of the disease were shown to have developed\nlesions or \u201choles\u201d in the brain, causing the brain tissue to resemble a sponge. Later on in the outbreak, however, it was\nshown that a similar encephalopathy in humans known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) could be acquired from\neating beef from animals with BSE, sparking bans by various countries on the importation of British beef and causing\nconsiderable economic damage to the British beef industry (Figure 21.18). BSE still exists in various areas, and although a\nrare disease, individuals that acquire CJD are difficult to treat. The disease can be spread from human to human by blood,\nso many countries have banned blood donation from regions associated with BSE.\nThe cause of spongiform encephalopathies, such as kuru and BSE, is an infectious structural variant of a normal cellular\nprotein called PrP (prion protein). It is this variant that constitutes the prion particle. PrP exists in two forms, PrPc, the\nnormal form of the protein, and PrPsc, the infectious form. Once introduced into the body, the PrPsc contained within the\nprion binds to PrPc and converts it to PrPsc. This leads to an exponential increase of the PrPsc protein, which aggregates.\nPrPsc is folded abnormally, and the resulting conformation (shape) is directly responsible for the lesions seen in the brains\nof infected cattle. Thus, although not without some detractors among scientists, the prion seems likely to be an entirely new\nform of infectious agent, the first one found whose transmission is not reliant upon genes made of DNA or RNA.\nFigure 21.18 (a) Endogenous normal prion protein (PrPc) is converted into the disease-causing form (PrPsc) when it\nencounters this variant form of the protein. PrPsc may arise spontaneously in brain tissue, especially if a mutant form\nof the protein is present, or it may occur via the spread of misfolded prions consumed in food into brain tissue. (b) This\nprion-infected brain tissue, visualized using light microscopy, shows the vacuoles that give it a spongy texture, typical\nof transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.

They do not\nhave a capsid or outer envelope, but like viruses can reproduce only within a host cell. Viroids do not, however, manufacture\nany proteins, and they only produce a single, specific RNA molecule. Human diseases caused by viroids have yet to be\nidentified.\nViroids are known to infect plants (Figure 21.19) and are responsible for crop failures and the loss of millions of dollars\nin agricultural revenue each year. Some of the plants they infect include potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes, chrysanthemums,\navocados, and coconut palms.\nFigure 21.19 These potatoes have been infected by the potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTV), which is typically spread\nwhen infected knives are used to cut healthy potatoes, which are then planted.

Training in virology\ncan lead to many different career paths. Virologists are actively involved in academic research and teaching\nin colleges and medical schools. Some virologists treat patients or are involved in the generation and\nproduction of vaccines. They might participate in epidemiologic studies (Figure 21.20) or become science\nwriters, to name just a few possible careers.\nFigure 21.20 This virologist is engaged in fieldwork, sampling eggs from this nest for avian influenza.

Many large medical\ncenters have departments of virology, and smaller hospitals usually have virology labs within their\nmicrobiology departments. Volunteer in a virology lab for a semester or work in one over the summer.\nDiscussing the profession and getting a first-hand look at the work will help you decide whether a career in\nvirology is right for you.

Although some bacteria are pathogens, many are not. For\nexample, the commensal bacteria that inhabit our skin and gastrointestinal tract do a host of good things for us. They protect\nus from pathogens, help us digest our food, and produce some of our vitamins and other nutrients. These activities have\nbeen known for a long time. More recently, scientists have gathered evidence that these bacteria may also help regulate our\nmoods, influence our activity levels, and even help control weight by affecting our food choices and absorption patterns.\nThe Human Microbiome Project has begun the process of cataloging our normal bacteria (and archaea) so we can better\nunderstand these functions. You can learn more about the Human Microbiome Project here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/\n32microbiome) .\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\n889\n22.1 | Prokaryotic Diversity\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat is the evolutionary history of prokaryotes?\n\u2022\nWhat are distinguishing features of extremophiles?\n\u2022\nWhy is it difficult to culture prokaryotes for study purposes?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nIn the recent past, scientists grouped living organisms into five kingdoms based on several criteria, including the absence\nor presence of a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, the absence or presence of cell walls, multicellularity, and\nso on. As we learned earlier, prokaryotes were the first cells to evolve on Earth 3.5 to 4.5 millions of years ago and lacked\na nucleus and cytoplasmic organelles. In the late 20th century, scientists compared sequences of small-subunit ribosomal\nRNA, which resulted in a more fundamental way to group organisms on Earth. Based on the differences in the structure of\nthe cell membranes and in rRNA, Carl Woese and his colleagues proposed the three domain system. The domain Bacteria\ncomprises all organisms in the kingdom Eubacteria (bacteria), the domain Archaea comprises the rest of the prokaryotes,\nand the domain Eukarya comprises all eukaryotes, including protists, fungi, plants, and animals. Prokaryotes exhibit great\ndiversity in form and function and are abundant and ubiquitous. In addition to inhabiting moderate environments like the\nhuman digestive system, prokaryotes are found in extreme conditions (extremophiles), from boiling hot springs to the Great\nSalt Lake and to frozen environments in Antarctica.\nBecause prokaryotes inhabit many different environments, they have evolved multiple strategies for meeting their energy\ndemands, including chemosynthesis, photosynthesis, anaerobic cellular respiration, and aerobic cellular respiration. Hot\nsprings and hydrothermal vents may have been the environments in which life began, and there is fossil evidence of the\npresence of microbial mats about 3.5 billion years ago. During the first two billion years of Earth\u2019s history, the atmosphere\nlacked sufficient quantities of oxygen, and only anaerobic organisms were able to live. Cyanobacteria evolved from early\nphototrophs and began the oxygenation of the atmosphere. The increase in oxygen concentration allows the evolution of\nother life forms with other metabolic processes. Most prokaryotes prefer to live in communities, often forming biofilms.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 1 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework. The AP\u00ae Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent\nfoundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP\u00ae exam\nquestions.

They cover every imaginable surface where there is sufficient moisture, and they live on and\ninside of other living things. In the typical human body, prokaryotic cells outnumber human body cells by about ten to one.\nThey comprise the majority of living things in all ecosystems. Some prokaryotes thrive in environments that are inhospitable\nfor most living things. Prokaryotes recycle nutrients\u2014essential substances (such as carbon and nitrogen)\u2014and they drive\nthe evolution of new ecosystems, some of which are natural and others man-made. Prokaryotes have been on Earth since\nlong before multicellular life appeared.\nProkaryotes, the First Inhabitants of Earth\nWhen and where did life begin? What were the conditions on Earth when life began? Prokaryotes were the first forms of life\non Earth, and they existed for billions of years before plants and animals appeared. The Earth and its moon are thought to be\nabout 4.54 billion years old. This estimate is based on evidence from radiometric dating of meteorite material together with\nother substrate material from Earth and the moon. Early Earth had a very different atmosphere (contained less molecular\noxygen) than it does today and was subjected to strong radiation; thus, the first organisms would have flourished where\nthey were more protected, such as in ocean depths or beneath the surface of the Earth. At this time too, strong volcanic\nactivity was common on Earth, so it is likely that these first organisms\u2014the first prokaryotes\u2014were adapted to very high\ntemperatures. Early Earth was prone to geological upheaval and volcanic eruption, and was subject to bombardment by\nmutagenic radiation from the sun. The first organisms were prokaryotes that could withstand these harsh conditions.\nMicrobial Mats\nMicrobial mats or large biofilms may represent the earliest forms of life on Earth; there is fossil evidence of their presence\nstarting about 3.5 billion years ago. A microbial mat is a multi-layered sheet of prokaryotes (Figure 22.2) that includes\nmostly bacteria, but also archaea. Microbial mats are a few centimeters thick, and they typically grow where different types\nof materials interface, mostly on moist surfaces. The various types of prokaryotes that comprise them carry out different\nmetabolic pathways, and that is the reason for their various colors. Prokaryotes in a microbial mat are held together by a\nglue-like sticky substance that they secrete called extracellular matrix.\nThe first microbial mats likely obtained their energy from chemicals found near hydrothermal vents. A hydrothermal\nvent is a breakage or fissure in the Earth\u2019s surface that releases geothermally heated water. With the evolution of\nphotosynthesis about 3 billion years ago, some prokaryotes in microbial mats came to use a more widely available energy\nsource\u2014sunlight\u2014whereas others were still dependent on chemicals from hydrothermal vents for energy and food.\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\n891\nFigure 22.2 This (a) microbial mat, about one meter in diameter, grows over a hydrothermal vent in the Pacific Ocean\nin a region known as the \u201cPacific Ring of Fire.\u201d The mat helps retain microbial nutrients. Chimneys such as the\none indicated by the arrow allow gases to escape. (b) In this micrograph, bacteria are visualized using fluorescence\nmicroscopy. (credit a: modification of work by Dr. Bob Embley, NOAA PMEL, Chief Scientist; credit b: modification of\nwork by Ricardo Murga, Rodney Donlan, CDC; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nStromatolites\nFossilized microbial mats represent the earliest record of life on Earth. A stromatolite is a sedimentary structure formed\nwhen minerals are precipitated out of water by prokaryotes in a microbial mat (Figure 22.3). Stromatolites form layered\nrocks made of carbonate or silicate. Although most stromatolites are artifacts from the past, there are places on Earth where\nstromatolites are still forming. For example, growing stromatolites have been found in the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park\nin San Diego County, California.\nFigure 22.3 (a) These living stromatolites are located in Shark Bay, Australia. (b) These fossilized stromatolites, found\nin Glacier National Park, Montana, are nearly 1.5 billion years old. (credit a: Robert Young; credit b: P. Carrara, NPS)\nThe Ancient Atmosphere\nEvidence indicates that during the first two billion years of Earth\u2019s existence, the atmosphere was anoxic, meaning that there\nwas no molecular oxygen. Therefore, only those organisms that can grow without oxygen\u2014anaerobic organisms\u2014were\nable to live. Autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called phototrophs, and they\nappeared within one billion years of the formation of Earth. Then, cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae,\nevolved from these simple phototrophs one billion years later. Cyanobacteria (Figure 22.4) began the oxygenation of the\natmosphere. Increased atmospheric oxygen allowed the development of more efficient O2-utilizing catabolic pathways. It\nalso opened up the land to increased colonization, because some O2 is converted into O3 (ozone) and ozone effectively\nabsorbs the ultraviolet light that would otherwise cause lethal mutations in DNA. Ultimately, the increase in O2\nconcentrations allowed the evolution of other life forms.\n892\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 22.4 This hot spring in Yellowstone National Park flows toward the foreground.

(credit: Graciela Brelles-\nMari\u00f1o)\nEarly Earth was inhospitable to most life as we know it today, with a substantial amount of geological\nupheaval, volcanic activity, and an anoxic atmosphere (which means it lacked oxygen). Therefore, the origin\nof life on Earth is of great interest to scientists.\nOne of the earliest hypotheses of how life originated on Earth was by panspermia, which dates back to the\n5th century BC. Panspermia is the idea that life is distributed to different parts of the universe on objects\nsuch as meteoroids and asteroids. If this were to occur, organic compounds and microorganisms would be\nable to survive the extreme conditions of space.\nHowever, in the 1960s, scientists Stanley Miller and Harold Urey conducted laboratory experiments that\nshowed it was possible for organic compounds, including amino acids, to be formed under certain conditions\nfrom inorganic molecules and energy, both of which would have been present in the early conditions of\nEarth. Subsequently, fossilized evidence of microbial mats by deep sea hydrothermal vents that dates back\n3.5 billion years was discovered. Consequently, there are now several hypotheses regarding how life could\nhave evolved on Earth.\nActivity\nPerform internet research using reliable webpages containing current scientific evidence supporting the\nideas that 1) life originated on Earth, and 2) that life arrived on Earth from an extraterrestrial object, such\nas an asteroid or comet. Then decide which idea has more supporting evidence. Be able to justify your\nconclusion.\nThink About It\nIf organic compounds, which eventually formed organisms, could have formed both extraterrestrially and on Earth,\nwhy would it be less complicated, and thus more likely, that life formed on Earth?\nThink About It\nEven though Miller and Urey showed that organic molecules could be produced from conditions of early Earth, why\nare there still different hypotheses about how life could have originated on Earth?\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\n893\nMicrobes Are Adaptable: Life in Moderate and Extreme Environments\nSome organisms have developed strategies that allow them to survive harsh conditions. Prokaryotes thrive in a vast array\nof environments: Some grow in conditions that would seem very normal to us, whereas others are able to thrive and grow\nunder conditions that would kill a plant or animal. Almost all prokaryotes have a cell wall, a protective structure that allows\nthem to survive in both hyper- and hypo-osmotic conditions. Some soil bacteria are able to form endospores that resist\nheat and drought, thereby allowing the organism to survive until favorable conditions recur. These adaptations, along with\nothers, allow bacteria to be the most abundant life form in all terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.\nOther bacteria and archaea are adapted to grow under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles, meaning \u201clovers of\nextremes.\u201d Extremophiles have been found in all kinds of environments: the depth of the oceans, hot springs, the Artic and\nthe Antarctic, in very dry places, deep inside Earth, in harsh chemical environments, and in high radiation environments\n(Figure 22.5), just to mention a few. These organisms give us a better understanding of prokaryotic diversity and open up\nthe possibility of finding new prokaryotic species that may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic drugs or have industrial\napplications. Because they have specialized adaptations that allow them to live in extreme conditions, many extremophiles\ncannot survive in moderate environments. There are many different groups of extremophiles: They are identified based on\nthe conditions in which they grow best, and several habitats are extreme in multiple ways. For example, a soda lake is\nboth salty and alkaline, so organisms that live in a soda lake must be both alkaliphiles and halophiles (Table 22.1). Other\nextremophiles, like radioresistant organisms, do not prefer an extreme environment (in this case, one with high levels of\nradiation), but have adapted to survive in it (Figure 22.5).\nExtremophiles and Their Preferred Conditions\nExtremophile Type\nConditions for Optimal Growth\nAcidophiles\npH 3 or below\nAlkaliphiles\npH 9 or above\nThermophiles\nTemperature 60\u201380 \u00b0C (140\u2013176 \u00b0F)\nHyperthermophiles\nTemperature 80\u2013122 \u00b0C (176\u2013250 \u00b0F)\nPsychrophiles\nTemperature of -15-10 \u00b0C (5-50 \u00b0F) or lower\nHalophiles\nSalt concentration of at least 0.2 M\nOsmophiles\nHigh sugar concentration\nTable 22.1\n894\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 22.5 Deinococcus radiodurans, visualized in this false color transmission electron micrograph, is a prokaryote\nthat can tolerate very high doses of ionizing radiation. It has developed DNA repair mechanisms that allow it to\nreconstruct its chromosome even if it has been broken into hundreds of pieces by radiation or heat. (credit: modification\nof work by Michael Daly; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nProkaryotes in the Dead Sea\nOne example of a very harsh environment is the Dead Sea, a hypersaline basin that is located between Jordan and Israel.\nHypersaline environments are essentially concentrated seawater. In the Dead Sea, the sodium concentration is 10 times\nhigher than that of seawater, and the water contains high levels of magnesium (about 40 times higher than in seawater)\nthat would be toxic to most living things. Iron, calcium, and magnesium, elements that form divalent ions (Fe2+, Ca2+, and\nMg2+), produce what is commonly referred to as \u201chard\u201d water. Taken together, the high concentration of divalent cations,\nthe acidic pH (6.0), and the intense solar radiation flux make the Dead Sea a unique, and uniquely hostile, ecosystem\n[1]\n(Figure 22.6).\nWhat sort of prokaryotes do we find in the Dead Sea? The extremely salt-tolerant bacterial mats include Halobacterium,\nHaloferax volcanii (which is found in other locations, not only the Dead Sea), Halorubrum sodomense, and Halobaculum\ngomorrense, and the archaea Haloarcula marismortui, among others.\nFigure 22.6 (a) The Dead Sea is hypersaline. Nevertheless, salt-tolerant bacteria thrive in this sea. (b) These\nhalobacteria cells can form salt-tolerant bacterial mats. (credit a: Julien Menichini; credit b: NASA; scale-bar data from\nMatt Russell)\nUnculturable Prokaryotes and the Viable-but-Non-Culturable State\nMicrobiologists typically grow prokaryotes in the laboratory using an appropriate culture medium containing all the\nnutrients needed by the target organism. The medium can be liquid, broth, or solid. After an incubation time at the right\ntemperature, there should be evidence of microbial growth (Figure 22.7). The process of culturing bacteria is complex\n1. Bodaker, I, Itai, S, Suzuki, MT, Feingersch, R, Rosenberg, M, Maguire, ME, Shimshon, B, and others.

The ISME Journal 4 (2010): 399\u2013407, doi:10.1038/ismej.2009.141. published online 24 December 2009.\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\n895\nand is one of the greatest discoveries of modern science. German physician Robert Koch is credited with discovering the\ntechniques for pure culture, including staining and using growth media. His assistant Julius Petri invented the Petri dish\nwhose use persists in today\u2019s laboratories. Koch worked primarily with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium that\ncauses tuberculosis and developed postulates to identify disease-causing organisms that continue to be widely used in the\nmedical community. Koch\u2019s postulates include that an organism can be identified as the cause of disease when it is present in\nall infected samples and absent in all healthy samples, and it is able to reproduce the infection after being cultured multiple\ntimes. Today, cultures remain a primary diagnostic tool in medicine and other areas of molecular biology.\nFigure 22.7 In these agar plates, the growth medium is supplemented with red blood cells. Blood agar becomes\ntransparent in the presence of hemolytic Streptococcus, which destroys red blood cells and is used to diagnose\nStreptococcus infections. The plate on the left is inoculated with non-hemolytic Staphylococcus (large white colonies),\nand the plate on the right is inoculated with hemolytic Streptococcus (tiny clear colonies). If you look closely at the right\nplate, you can see that the agar surrounding the bacteria has turned clear. (credit: Bill Branson, NCI)\nSome prokaryotes, however, cannot grow in a laboratory setting. In fact, over 99 percent of bacteria and archaea are\nunculturable. For the most part, this is due to a lack of knowledge as to what to feed these organisms and how to grow them;\nthey have special requirements for growth that remain unknown to scientists, such as needing specific micronutrients, pH,\ntemperature, pressure, co-factors, or co-metabolites. Some bacteria cannot be cultured because they are obligate intracellular\nparasites and cannot be grown outside a host cell.\nIn other cases, culturable organisms become unculturable under stressful conditions, even though the same organism could\nbe cultured previously. Those organisms that cannot be cultured but are not dead are in a viable-but-non-culturable\n(VBNC) state. The VBNC state occurs when prokaryotes respond to environmental stressors by entering a dormant state\nthat allows their survival. The criteria for entering into the VBNC state are not completely understood. In a process called\nresuscitation, the prokaryote can go back to \u201cnormal\u201d life when environmental conditions improve.\nIs the VBNC state an unusual way of living for prokaryotes? In fact, most of the prokaryotes living in the soil or in oceanic\nwaters are non-culturable. It has been said that only a small fraction, perhaps one percent, of prokaryotes can be cultured\nunder laboratory conditions. If these organisms are non-culturable, then how is it known whether they are present and alive?\nMicrobiologists use molecular techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to amplify selected portions of\nDNA of prokaryotes, demonstrating their existence. Recall that PCR can make billions of copies of a DNA segment in a\nprocess called amplification.\nThe Ecology of Biofilms\nUntil a couple of decades ago, microbiologists used to think of prokaryotes as isolated entities living apart. This model,\nhowever, does not reflect the true ecology of prokaryotes, most of which prefer to live in communities where they can\ninteract. A biofilm is a microbial community (Figure 22.8) held together in a gummy-textured matrix that consists primarily\nof polysaccharides secreted by the organisms, together with some proteins and nucleic acids. Biofilms grow attached to\nsurfaces. Some of the best-studied biofilms are composed of prokaryotes, although fungal biofilms have also been described\nas well as some composed of a mixture of fungi and bacteria.\nBiofilms are present almost everywhere: they can cause the clogging of pipes and readily colonize surfaces in industrial\nsettings. In recent, large-scale outbreaks of bacterial contamination of food, biofilms have played a major role. They also\ncolonize household surfaces, such as kitchen counters, cutting boards, sinks, and toilets, as well as places on the human\nbody, such as the surfaces of our teeth.\nInteractions among the organisms that populate a biofilm, together with their protective exopolysaccharidic (EPS)\nenvironment, make these communities more robust than free-living, or planktonic, prokaryotes. The sticky substance\nthat holds bacteria together also excludes most antibiotics and disinfectants, making biofilm bacteria hardier than their\n896\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nplanktonic counterparts. Overall, biofilms are very difficult to destroy because they are resistant to many common forms of\nsterilization.\nFigure 22.8 Five stages of biofilm development are shown. During stage 1, initial attachment, bacteria adhere to\na solid surface via weak van der Waals interactions. During stage 2, irreversible attachment, hairlike appendages\ncalled pili permanently anchor the bacteria to the surface. During stage 3, maturation I, the biofilm grows through\ncell division and recruitment of other bacteria. An extracellular matrix composed primarily of polysaccharides\nholds the biofilm together. During stage 4, maturation II, the biofilm continues to grow and takes on a more\ncomplex shape. During stage 5, dispersal, the biofilm matrix is partly broken down, allowing some bacteria to\nescape and colonize another surface. Micrographs of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm in each of the stages of\ndevelopment are shown. (credit: D.

        "summary": "Prokaryotic diversity encompasses the vast range of forms, functions, and habitats of bacteria and archaea, the earliest life forms on Earth, which appeared 3.5\u20134.5 billion years ago. Initially thriving in an anoxic, geologically volatile environment, early prokaryotes likely lived in ocean depths or underground, forming microbial mats and stromatolites and evolving metabolic strategies such as chemosynthesis and, later, photosynthesis by cyanobacteria, which oxygenated the atmosphere and enabled more complex life. Prokaryotes inhabit nearly every environment, from moderate to extreme (extremophiles), including hot springs, polar regions, salt lakes, and high-radiation zones, aided by adaptations like cell walls, endospores, and specialized metabolisms. Many are unculturable in laboratory conditions due to unknown growth requirements or a viable-but-non-culturable (VBNC) state, though molecular techniques like PCR reveal their presence. Most live in structured communities called biofilms, which provide protection, resource sharing, and resistance to environmental stress, antibiotics, and disinfectants, and have significant ecological, industrial, and medical impacts."

However, all cells have four common structures: the\nplasma membrane, which functions as a barrier for the cell and separates the cell from its environment; the cytoplasm, a\njelly-like substance inside the cell; nucleic acids, the genetic material of the cell; and ribosomes, where protein synthesis\ntakes place. Prokaryotes come in various shapes, but many fall into three categories: cocci (spherical), bacilli (rod-shaped),\nand spirilli (spiral-shaped) (Figure 22.9).\n898\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 22.9 Prokaryotes fall into three basic categories based on their shape, visualized here using scanning electron\nmicroscopy: (a) cocci, or spherical (a pair is shown); (b) bacilli, or rod-shaped; and (c) spirilli, or spiral-shaped. (credit\na: modification of work by Janice Haney Carr, Dr. Richard Facklam, CDC; credit c: modification of work by Dr. David\nCox; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nThe Prokaryotic Cell\nRecall that prokaryotes (Figure 22.10) are unicellular organisms that lack organelles or other internal membrane-bound\nstructures. Therefore, they do not have a nucleus but instead generally have a single chromosome\u2014a piece of circular,\ndouble-stranded DNA located in an area of the cell called the nucleoid. Most prokaryotes have a cell wall outside the plasma\nmembrane.\nFigure 22.10 The features of a typical prokaryotic cell are shown.\nRecall that prokaryotes are divided into two different domains, Bacteria and Archaea, which together with Eukarya,\ncomprise the three domains of life (Figure 22.11).\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\n899\nFigure 22.11 Bacteria and Archaea are both prokaryotes but differ enough to be placed in separate domains. An\nancestor of modern Archaea is believed to have given rise to Eukarya, the third domain of life. Archaeal and bacterial\nphyla are shown; the evolutionary relationship between these phyla is still open to debate.\nThe composition of the cell wall differs significantly between the domains Bacteria and Archaea. The composition of\ntheir cell walls also differs from the eukaryotic cell walls found in plants (cellulose) or fungi and insects (chitin). The cell\nwall functions as a protective layer, and it is responsible for the organism\u2019s shape. Some bacteria have an outer capsule\noutside the cell wall. Other structures are present in some prokaryotic species, but not in others (Table 22.2). For example,\nthe capsule found in some species enables the organism to attach to surfaces, protects it from dehydration and attack by\nphagocytic cells, and makes pathogens more resistant to our immune responses. Some species also have flagella (singular,\nflagellum) used for locomotion, and pili (singular, pilus) used for attachment to surfaces. Plasmids, which consist of extra-\nchromosomal DNA, are also present in many species of bacteria and archaea.\nCharacteristics of phyla of Bacteria are described in Figure 22.12 and Figure 22.13; Archaea are described in Figure 22.14.\n900\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 22.12 Phylum Proteobacteria is one of up to 52 bacteria phyla.

Its selectively permeable nature keeps ions, proteins, and other molecules within the cell and prevents them\nfrom diffusing into the extracellular environment, while other molecules may move through the membrane. Recall that the\ngeneral structure of a cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer composed of two layers of lipid molecules. In archaeal cell\nmembranes, isoprene (phytanyl) chains linked to glycerol replace the fatty acids linked to glycerol in bacterial membranes.\nSome archaeal membranes are lipid monolayers instead of bilayers (Figure 22.14).\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\n903\nFigure 22.15 Archaeal phospholipids differ from those found in Bacteria and Eukarya in two ways. First, they have\nbranched phytanyl sidechains instead of linear ones. Second, an ether bond instead of an ester bond connects the\nlipid to the glycerol.\nThe Cell Wall\nThe cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells has a high concentration of dissolved solutes. Therefore, the osmotic pressure within\nthe cell is relatively high. The cell wall is a protective layer that surrounds some cells and gives them shape and rigidity.\nIt is located outside the cell membrane and prevents osmotic lysis (bursting due to increasing volume). The chemical\ncomposition of the cell walls varies between archaea and bacteria, and also varies between bacterial species.\nBacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan, composed of polysaccharide chains that are cross-linked by unusual peptides\ncontaining both L- and D-amino acids including D-glutamic acid and D-alanine. Proteins normally have only L-amino\nacids; as a consequence, many of our antibiotics work by mimicking D-amino acids and therefore have specific effects on\nbacterial cell wall development. There are more than 100 different forms of peptidoglycan. S-layer (surface layer) proteins\nare also present on the outside of cell walls of both archaea and bacteria.\nBacteria are divided into two major groups: Gram positive and Gram negative, based on their reaction to Gram staining.\nNote that all Gram-positive bacteria belong to one phylum; bacteria in the other phyla (Proteobacteria, Chlamydias,\nSpirochetes, Cyanobacteria, and others) are Gram-negative. The Gram staining method is named after its inventor, Danish\nscientist Hans Christian Gram (1853\u20131938). The different bacterial responses to the staining procedure are ultimately due to\ncell wall structure. Gram-positive organisms typically lack the outer membrane found in Gram-negative organisms (Figure\n22.15). Up to 90 percent of the cell wall in Gram-positive bacteria is composed of peptidoglycan, and most of the rest\nis composed of acidic substances called teichoic acids. Teichoic acids may be covalently linked to lipids in the plasma\nmembrane to form lipoteichoic acids. Lipoteichoic acids anchor the cell wall to the cell membrane. Gram-negative bacteria\nhave a relatively thin cell wall composed of a few layers of peptidoglycan (only 10 percent of the total cell wall), surrounded\nby an outer envelope containing lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and lipoproteins. This outer envelope is sometimes referred to as\na second lipid bilayer. The chemistry of this outer envelope is very different, however, from that of the typical lipid bilayer\nthat forms plasma membranes.\n904\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 22.16 Bacteria are divided into two major groups: Gram positive and Gram negative. Both groups have\na cell wall composed of peptidoglycan: in Gram-positive bacteria, the wall is thick, whereas in Gram-negative\nbacteria, the wall is thin. In Gram-negative bacteria, the cell wall is surrounded by an outer membrane that\ncontains lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Porins are proteins in this cell membrane that allow substances to\npass through the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. In Gram-positive bacteria, lipoteichoic acid anchors\nthe cell wall to the cell membrane.

There are four different types of Archaean cell walls. One type is\ncomposed of pseudopeptidoglycan, which is similar to peptidoglycan in morphology but contains different sugars in the\npolysaccharide chain. The other three types of cell walls are composed of polysaccharides, glycoproteins, or pure protein.\nStructural Differences and Similarities between Bacteria and Archaea\nStructural Characteristic\nBacteria\nArchaea\nCell type\nProkaryotic\nProkaryotic\nCell morphology\nVariable\nVariable\nCell wall\nContains peptidoglycan\nDoes not contain peptidoglycan\nCell membrane type\nLipid bilayer\nLipid bilayer or lipid monolayer\nPlasma membrane lipids\nFatty acids\nPhytanyl groups\nTable 22.2\nReproduction\nReproduction in prokaryotes is asexual and usually takes place by binary fission. Recall that the DNA of a prokaryote exists\nas a single, circular chromosome. Prokaryotes do not undergo mitosis. Rather the chromosome is replicated and the two\nresulting copies separate from one another, due to the growth of the cell. The prokaryote, now enlarged, is pinched inward at\nits equator and the two resulting cells, which are clones, separate. Binary fission does not provide an opportunity for genetic\nrecombination or genetic diversity, but prokaryotes can share genes by three other mechanisms.\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\n905\nIn transformation, the prokaryote takes in DNA found in its environment that is shed by other prokaryotes. If a\nnonpathogenic bacterium takes up DNA for a toxin gene from a pathogen and incorporates the new DNA into its own\nchromosome, it too may become pathogenic. In transduction, bacteriophages, the viruses that infect bacteria, sometimes\nalso move short pieces of chromosomal DNA from one bacterium to another. Transduction results in a recombinant\norganism. Archaea are not affected by bacteriophages but instead have their own viruses that translocate genetic material\nfrom one individual to another. In conjugation, DNA is transferred from one prokaryote to another by means of a pilus,\nwhich brings the organisms into contact with one another. The DNA transferred can be in the form of a plasmid or as a\nhybrid, containing both plasmid and chromosomal DNA. These three processes of DNA exchange are shown in Figure\n22.17.\nReproduction can be very rapid: a few minutes for some species. This short generation time coupled with mechanisms of\ngenetic recombination and high rates of mutation result in the rapid evolution of prokaryotes, allowing them to respond to\nenvironmental changes (such as the introduction of an antibiotic) very quickly.\nFigure 22.17 Besides binary fission, there are three other mechanisms by which prokaryotes can exchange DNA. In\n(a) transformation, the cell takes up prokaryotic DNA directly from the environment. The DNA may remain separate as\nplasmid DNA or be incorporated into the host genome. In (b) transduction, a bacteriophage injects DNA into the cell\nthat contains a small fragment of DNA from a different prokaryote. In (c) conjugation, DNA is transferred from one cell\nto another via a mating bridge that connects the two cells after the sex pilus draws the two bacteria close enough to\nform the bridge.\n906\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nThe Evolution of Prokaryotes\nHow do scientists answer questions about the evolution of prokaryotes?

        "summary": "Prokaryotes, which include organisms in the domains Bacteria and Archaea, are unicellular and lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, possessing instead a single circular chromosome in a nucleoid region along with ribosomes for protein synthesis. They share common cell structures such as a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, genetic material, and ribosomes, and can exhibit shapes like cocci, bacilli, or spirilli. Most have a cell wall, whose composition differs between Bacteria (containing peptidoglycan) and Archaea (lacking peptidoglycan), with bacterial walls varying between Gram-positive (thick peptidoglycan, teichoic acids) and Gram-negative (thin peptidoglycan, outer membrane with lipopolysaccharides). Some species have additional features such as capsules for protection and adhesion, flagella for movement, and pili for attachment or DNA transfer. Plasma membrane structure also differs, with Archaea possessing ether-linked lipids (sometimes as monolayers) versus the fatty acid\u2013based bilayers of Bacteria. Reproduction is asexual via binary fission, but genetic variation can occur through transformation, transduction, and conjugation. These mechanisms, combined with short generation times and high mutation rates, enable rapid evolution. Prokaryotes have ancient origins, with Bacteria and Archaea diverging billions of years ago, and early groups like Cyanobacteria contributing significantly to Earth\u2019s oxygenation and exhibiting adaptations for terrestrial life."

These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 4.7][APLO 4.10][APLO 4.23][APLO 2.28]\nNeeds of Prokaryotes\nThe diverse environments and ecosystems on Earth have a wide range of conditions in terms of temperature, available\nnutrients, acidity, salinity, and energy sources. Prokaryotes are very well equipped to make their living out of a vast array of\nnutrients and conditions. To live, prokaryotes need a source of energy, a source of carbon, and some additional nutrients.\nMacronutrients\nCells are essentially a well-organized assemblage of macromolecules and water. Recall that macromolecules are produced\nby the polymerization of smaller units called monomers. For cells to build all of the molecules required to sustain life, they\nneed certain substances, collectively called nutrients. When prokaryotes grow in nature, they obtain their nutrients from\nthe environment. Nutrients that are required in large amounts are called macronutrients, whereas those required in smaller\nor trace amounts are called micronutrients. Just a handful of elements are considered macronutrients\u2014carbon, hydrogen,\n908\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\noxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. (A mnemonic for remembering these elements is the acronym CHONPS.)\nWhy are these macronutrients needed in large amounts? They are the components of organic compounds in cells, including\nwater. Carbon is the major element in all macromolecules: carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and many other\ncompounds. Carbon accounts for about 50 percent of the composition of the cell. Nitrogen represents 12 percent of the total\ndry weight of a typical cell and is a component of proteins, nucleic acids, and other cell constituents. Most of the nitrogen\navailable in nature is either atmospheric nitrogen (N2) or another inorganic form. Diatomic (N2) nitrogen, however, can be\nconverted into an organic form only by certain organisms, called nitrogen-fixing organisms. Both hydrogen and oxygen are\npart of many organic compounds and of water. Phosphorus is required by all organisms for the synthesis of nucleotides\nand phospholipids. Sulfur is part of the structure of some amino acids such as cysteine and methionine, and is also present\nin several vitamins and coenzymes. Other important macronutrients are potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca),\nand sodium (Na). Although these elements are required in smaller amounts, they are very important for the structure and\nfunction of the prokaryotic cell.\nMicronutrients\nIn addition to these macronutrients, prokaryotes require various metallic elements in small amounts. These are referred\nto as micronutrients or trace elements. For example, iron is necessary for the function of the cytochromes involved in\nelectron-transport reactions. Some prokaryotes require other elements\u2014such as boron (B), chromium (Cr), and manganese\n(Mn)\u2014primarily as enzyme cofactors.\nThe Ways in Which Prokaryotes Obtain Energy\nProkaryotes can use different sources of energy to assemble macromolecules from smaller molecules. Phototrophs\n(or phototrophic organisms) obtain their energy from sunlight. Chemotrophs (or chemosynthetic organisms) obtain\ntheir energy from chemical compounds. Chemotrophs that can use organic compounds as energy sources are called\nchemoorganotrophs. Those that can also use inorganic compounds as energy sources are called chemolithotrophs.\nThe Ways in Which Prokaryotes Obtain Carbon\nProkaryotes not only can use different sources of energy but also different sources of carbon compounds. Recall that\norganisms that are able to fix inorganic carbon are called autotrophs. Autotrophic prokaryotes synthesize organic molecules\nfrom carbon dioxide. In contrast, heterotrophic prokaryotes obtain carbon from organic compounds. To make the picture\nmore complex, the terms that describe how prokaryotes obtain energy and carbon can be combined. Thus, photoautotrophs\nuse energy from sunlight, and carbon from carbon dioxide and water, whereas chemoheterotrophs obtain energy and carbon\nfrom an organic chemical source. Chemolitoautotrophs obtain their energy from inorganic compounds, and they build\ntheir complex molecules from carbon dioxide. The table below (Table 22.3) summarizes carbon and energy sources in\nprokaryotes.\nCarbon and Energy Sources in Prokaryotes\nEnergy Sources\nCarbon Sources\nLight\nChemicals\nCarbon dioxide Organic compounds\nPhototrophs\nChemotrophs\nAutotrophs\nHeterotrophs\nOrganic chemicals\nInorganic chemicals\nChemo-organotrophs\nChemolithotrophs\nTable 22.3\nRole of Prokaryotes in Ecosystems\nProkaryotes are ubiquitous: There is no niche or ecosystem in which they are not present. Prokaryotes play many roles in\nthe environments they occupy. The roles they play in the carbon and nitrogen cycles are vital to life on Earth.\nProkaryotes and the Carbon Cycle\nCarbon is one of the most important macronutrients, and prokaryotes play an important role in the carbon cycle (Figure\n22.18). Carbon is cycled through Earth\u2019s major reservoirs: land, the atmosphere, aquatic environments, sediments and rocks,\nand biomass. The movement of carbon is via carbon dioxide, which is removed from the atmosphere by land plants and\nmarine prokaryotes, and is returned to the atmosphere via the respiration of chemoorganotrophic organisms, including\nprokaryotes, fungi, and animals. Although the largest carbon reservoir in terrestrial ecosystems is in rocks and sediments,\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\n909\nthat carbon is not readily available.\nA large amount of available carbon is found in land plants. Plants, which are producers, use carbon dioxide from the air\nto synthesize carbon compounds. Related to this, one very significant source of carbon compounds is humus, which is\na mixture of organic materials from dead plants and prokaryotes that have resisted decomposition. Consumers such as\nanimals use organic compounds generated by producers and release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Then, bacteria and\nfungi, collectively called decomposers, carry out the breakdown (decomposition) of plants and animals and their organic\ncompounds. The most important contributor of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is microbial decomposition of dead\nmaterial (dead animals, plants, and humus) that undergo respiration.\nIn aqueous environments and their anoxic sediments, there is another carbon cycle taking place. In this case, the cycle is\nbased on one-carbon compounds. In anoxic sediments, prokaryotes, mostly archaea, produce methane (CH4). This methane\nmoves into the zone above the sediment, which is richer in oxygen and supports bacteria called methane oxidizers that\noxidize methane to carbon dioxide, which then returns to the atmosphere.\nFigure 22.18 Prokaryotes play a significant role in continuously moving carbon through the biosphere. (credit:\nmodification of work by John M. Evans and Howard Perlman, USGS)\nProkaryotes and the Nitrogen Cycle\nNitrogen is a very important element for life because it is part of proteins and nucleic acids. It is a macronutrient, and in\nnature, it is recycled from organic compounds to ammonia, ammonium ions, nitrate, nitrite, and nitrogen gas by myriad\nprocesses, many of which are carried out only by prokaryotes. As illustrated in Figure 22.19, prokaryotes are key to the\nnitrogen cycle. The largest pool of nitrogen available in the terrestrial ecosystem is gaseous nitrogen from the air, but this\nnitrogen is not usable by plants, which are primary producers. Gaseous nitrogen is transformed, or \u201cfixed\u201d into more readily\navailable forms such as ammonia through the process of nitrogen fixation. Ammonia can be used by plants or converted to\nother forms.\nAnother source of ammonia is ammonification, the process by which ammonia is released during the decomposition of\nnitrogen-containing organic compounds. Ammonia released to the atmosphere, however, represents only 15 percent of the\ntotal nitrogen released; the rest is as N2 and N2O. Ammonia is catabolized anaerobically by some prokaryotes, yielding N2\nas the final product. Nitrification is the conversion of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate. Nitrification in soils is carried out\nby bacteria belonging to the genera Nitrosomas, Nitrobacter, and Nitrospira. The bacteria performs the reverse process, the\nreduction of nitrate from the soils to gaseous compounds such as N2O, NO, and N2, a process called denitrification.\n910\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 22.19 Prokaryotes play a key role in the nitrogen cycle.

        "summary": "Prokaryotic metabolism is highly diverse, allowing these organisms to thrive in a wide range of environments by utilizing various energy and carbon sources. They require essential macronutrients\u2014carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur\u2014and smaller amounts of other elements, along with micronutrients like metallic trace elements for enzyme function. Based on energy sources, prokaryotes can be phototrophs (using sunlight) or chemotrophs (using chemical compounds), with chemotrophs further divided into chemoorganotrophs (organic compounds) and chemolithotrophs (inorganic compounds). For carbon, autotrophs fix inorganic carbon (e.g., CO\u2082), while heterotrophs use organic carbon, producing combinations such as photoautotrophs or chemoheterotrophs. Prokaryotes are central to ecosystem nutrient cycles, especially the carbon and nitrogen cycles. In the carbon cycle, they contribute through photosynthesis, decomposition, methane production in anaerobic sediments, and methane oxidation. In the nitrogen cycle, they alone carry out key processes including nitrogen fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification, enabling the conversion between nitrogen\u2019s various chemical forms and making it available to other organisms."

The true cause of these diseases was not understood at the time, and some people thought\nthat diseases were a spiritual punishment. Over time, people came to realize that staying apart from afflicted persons, and\ndisposing of the corpses and personal belongings of victims of illness, reduced their own chances of getting sick.\n912\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nEpidemiologists study how diseases affect a population. An epidemic is a disease that occurs in an unusually high number\nof individuals in a population at the same time. A pandemic is a widespread, usually worldwide, epidemic. An endemic\ndisease is a disease that is constantly present, usually at low incidence, in a population.\nLong History of Bacterial Disease\nThere are records about infectious diseases as far back as 3000 B.C. A number of significant pandemics caused by bacteria\nhave been documented over several hundred years. Some of the most memorable pandemics led to the decline of cities and\nnations.\nIn the 21st century, infectious diseases remain among the leading causes of death worldwide, despite advances made in\nmedical research and treatments in recent decades. A disease spreads when the pathogen that causes it is passed from one\nperson to another. For a pathogen to cause disease, it must be able to reproduce in the host\u2019s body and damage the host in\nsome way.\nThe Plague of Athens\nIn 430 B.C., the Plague of Athens killed one-quarter of the Athenian troops that were fighting in the great Peloponnesian\nWar and weakened Athens\u2019 dominance and power. The plague impacted people living in overcrowded Athens as well\nas troops aboard ships that had to return to Athens. The source of the plague may have been identified recently when\nresearchers from the University of Athens were able to use DNA from teeth recovered from a mass grave. The scientists\nidentified nucleotide sequences from a pathogenic bacterium, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Figure 22.20), which\ncauses typhoid fever.\n[3] This disease is commonly seen in overcrowded areas and has caused epidemics throughout recorded\nhistory.\nFigure 22.20 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, the causative agent of Typhoid fever, is a Gram-negative, rod-\nshaped gamma protobacterium. Typhoid fever, which is spread through feces, causes intestinal hemorrhage, high\nfever, delirium and dehydration. Today, between 16 and 33 million cases of this re-emerging disease occur annually,\nresulting in over 200,000 deaths. Carriers of the disease can be asymptomatic. In a famous case in the early 1900s, a\ncook named Mary Mallon unknowingly spread the disease to over fifty people, three of whom died. Other Salmonella\nserotypes cause food poisoning. (credit: modification of work by NCI, CDC)\nBubonic Plagues\nFrom 541 to 750, an outbreak of what was likely a bubonic plague (the Plague of Justinian), eliminated one-quarter to one-\nhalf of the human population in the eastern Mediterranean region. The population in Europe dropped by 50 percent during\nthis outbreak. Bubonic plague would strike Europe more than once.\nOne of the most devastating pandemics was the Black Death (1346 to 1361) that is believed to have been another outbreak\nof bubonic plague caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. It is thought to have originated initially in China and spread\nalong the Silk Road, a network of land and sea trade routes, to the Mediterranean region and Europe, carried by rat fleas\nliving on black rats that were always present on ships. The Black Death reduced the world\u2019s population from an estimated\n450 million to about 350 to 375 million. Bubonic plague struck London hard again in the mid-1600s (Figure 22.21). In\nmodern times, approximately 1,000 to 3,000 cases of plague arise globally each year. Although contracting bubonic plague\nbefore antibiotics meant almost certain death, the bacterium responds to several types of modern antibiotics, and mortality\nrates from plague are now very low.\n3.

It has been estimated that up to 90 percent of Native Americans died from infectious diseases after the arrival of\nEuropeans, making conquest of the New World a foregone conclusion.\nEmerging and Re-emerging Diseases\nThe distribution of a particular disease is dynamic. Therefore, changes in the environment, the pathogen, or the host\n914\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\npopulation can dramatically impact the spread of a disease. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) an\nemerging disease (Figure 22.22) is one that has appeared in a population for the first time, or that may have existed\npreviously but is rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range. This definition also includes re-emerging diseases\nthat were previously under control. Approximately 75 percent of recently emerging infectious diseases affecting humans are\nzoonotic diseases, zoonoses, diseases that primarily infect animals and are transmitted to humans; some are of viral origin\nand some are of bacterial origin. Brucellosis is an example of a prokaryotic zoonosis that is re-emerging in some regions,\nand necrotizing fasciitis (commonly known as flesh-eating bacteria) has been increasing in virulence for the last 80 years\nfor unknown reasons.\nFigure 22.22 The map shows regions where bacterial diseases are emerging or reemerging. (credit: modification of\nwork by NIH)\nSome of the present emerging diseases are not actually new, but are diseases that were catastrophic in the past (Figure\n22.23). They devastated populations and became dormant for a while, just to come back, sometimes more virulent than\nbefore, as was the case with bubonic plague. Other diseases, like tuberculosis, were never eradicated but were under control\nin some regions of the world until coming back, mostly in urban centers with high concentrations of immunocompromised\npeople. The WHO has identified certain diseases whose worldwide re-emergence should be monitored. Among these are\ntwo viral diseases (dengue fever and yellow fever), and three bacterial diseases (diphtheria, cholera, and bubonic plague).\nThe war against infectious diseases has no foreseeable end.\nFigure 22.23 Lyme disease often, but not always, results in (a) a characteristic bullseye rash. The disease is caused by\na (b) Gram-negative spirochete bacterium of the genus Borrelia. The bacteria (c) infect ticks, which in turns infect mice.\nDeer are the preferred secondary host, but the ticks also may feed on humans. Untreated, the disease causes chronic\ndisorders in the nervous system, eyes, joints, and heart. The disease is named after Lyme, Connecticut, where an\noutbreak occurred in 1995 and has subsequently spread. The disease is not new, however. Genetic evidence suggests\nthat \u00d6tzi the Iceman, a 5,300-year-old mummy found in the Alps, was infected with Borrelia. (credit a: James Gathany,\nCDC; credit b: CDC; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nBiofilms and Disease\nRecall that biofilms are microbial communities that are very difficult to destroy. They are responsible for diseases such as\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\n915\ninfections in patients with cystic fibrosis, Legionnaires\u2019 disease, and otitis media. They produce dental plaque and colonize\ncatheters, prostheses, transcutaneous and orthopedic devices, contact lenses, and internal devices such as pacemakers.\nThey also form in open wounds and burned tissue. In healthcare environments, biofilms grow on hemodialysis machines,\nmechanical ventilators, shunts, and other medical equipment. In fact, 65 percent of all infections acquired in the hospital\n(nosocomial infections) are attributed to biofilms. Biofilms are also related to diseases contracted from food because they\ncolonize the surfaces of vegetable leaves and meat, as well as food-processing equipment that isn\u2019t adequately cleaned.\nBiofilm infections develop gradually; sometimes, they do not cause symptoms immediately. They are rarely resolved by\nhost defense mechanisms. Once an infection by a biofilm is established, it is very difficult to eradicate, because biofilms\ntend to be resistant to most of the methods used to control microbial growth, including antibiotics. Biofilms respond poorly\nor only temporarily to antibiotics; it has been said that they can resist up to 1,000 times the antibiotic concentrations used\nto kill the same bacteria when they are free-living or planktonic. An antibiotic dose that large would harm the patient;\ntherefore, scientists are working on new ways to get rid of biofilms.\nAntibiotics: Are We Facing a Crisis?\nThe word antibiotic comes from the Greek anti meaning \u201cagainst\u201d and bios meaning \u201clife.\u201d An antibiotic is a chemical,\nproduced either by microbes or synthetically, that is hostile to the growth of other organisms. Today\u2019s news and media often\naddress concerns about an antibiotic crisis. Are the antibiotics that easily treated bacterial infections in the past becoming\nobsolete? Are there new \u201csuperbugs\u201d\u2014bacteria that have evolved to become more resistant to our arsenal of antibiotics? Is\nthis the beginning of the end of antibiotics? All these questions challenge the healthcare community.\nOne of the main causes of resistant bacteria is the abuse of antibiotics. The imprudent and excessive use of antibiotics\nhas resulted in the natural selection of resistant forms of bacteria. The antibiotic kills most of the infecting bacteria, and\ntherefore only the resistant forms remain. These resistant forms reproduce, resulting in an increase in the proportion of\nresistant forms over non-resistant ones. Another major misuse of antibiotics is in patients with colds or the flu, for which\nantibiotics are useless. Another problem is the excessive use of antibiotics in livestock. The routine use of antibiotics in\nanimal feed promotes bacterial resistance as well. In the United States, 70 percent of the antibiotics produced are fed to\nanimals. These antibiotics are given to livestock in low doses, which maximize the probability of resistance developing, and\nthese resistant bacteria are readily transferred to humans.\nVisit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/antibiotics) to learn more about the problem of routine antibiotic\nadministration to livestock and antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\nIn your own words, what is the problem with administering antibiotics to livestock when they are not in need of them?\na.\nDevelopment of antibiotic-susceptible bacteria that can be transferred to humans, and their presence makes\ntreatment of disease with antibiotics (in animals or humans) much more difficult.\nb.\nDevelopment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that cannot be transferred to humans, and their presence makes\ntreatment of disease with antibiotics (in animals or humans) much more difficult.\nc.\nDevelopment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that can be transferred to humans, and their presence makes\ntreatment of disease with antibiotics (in animals or humans) much more difficult.\nd.\nDevelopment of antibiotic-susceptible bacteria that cannot be transferred to humans, and their presence\nmakes treatment of disease with antibiotics (in animals or humans) much more difficult.\nOne of the Superbugs: MRSA\nThe imprudent use of antibiotics has paved the way for bacteria to expand populations of resistant forms. For example,\nStaphylococcus aureus, often called \u201cstaph,\u201d is a common bacterium that can live in the human body and is usually\neasily treated with antibiotics. A very dangerous strain, however, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)\n916\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nhas made the news over the past few years (Figure 22.24). This strain is resistant to many commonly used antibiotics,\nincluding methicillin, amoxicillin, penicillin, and oxacillin. MRSA can cause infections of the skin, but it can also\ninfect the bloodstream, lungs, urinary tract, or sites of injury. While MRSA infections are common among people in\nhealthcare facilities, they have also appeared in healthy people who haven\u2019t been hospitalized but who live or work in tight\npopulations (like military personnel and prisoners). Researchers have expressed concern about the way this latter source\nof MRSA targets a much younger population than those residing in care facilities. The Journal of the American Medical\nAssociation reported that, among MRSA-afflicted persons in healthcare facilities, the average age is 68, whereas people\nwith \u201ccommunity-associated MRSA\u201d (CA-MRSA) have an average age of 23.[4]\nFigure 22.24 This scanning electron micrograph shows methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria,\ncommonly known as MRSA. S. aureus is not always pathogenic, but can cause diseases such as food poisoning and\nskin and respiratory infections. (credit: modification of work by Janice Haney Carr; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nIn summary, the medical community is facing an antibiotic crisis. Some scientists believe that after years of being protected\nfrom bacterial infections by antibiotics, we may be returning to a time in which a simple bacterial infection could again\ndevastate the human population. Researchers are developing new antibiotics, but it takes many years to of research and\nclinical trials, plus financial investments in the millions of dollars, to generate an effective and approved drug.\nFoodborne Diseases\nProkaryotes are everywhere: They readily colonize the surface of any type of material, and food is not an exception. Most of\nthe time, prokaryotes colonize food and food-processing equipment in the form of a biofilm. Outbreaks of bacterial infection\nrelated to food consumption are common. A foodborne disease (colloquially called \u201cfood poisoning\u201d) is an illness resulting\nfrom the consumption the pathogenic bacteria, viruses, or other parasites that contaminate food. Although the United States\nhas one of the safest food supplies in the world, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported\nthat \u201c76 million people get sick, more than 300,000 are hospitalized, and 5,000 Americans die each year from foodborne\nillness.\u201d\nThe characteristics of foodborne illnesses have changed over time. In the past, it was relatively common to hear about\nsporadic cases of botulism, the potentially fatal disease produced by a toxin from the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium\nbotulinum. Some of the most common sources for this bacterium were non-acidic canned foods, homemade pickles, and\nprocessed meat and sausages. The can, jar, or package created a suitable anaerobic environment where Clostridium could\ngrow. Proper sterilization and canning procedures have reduced the incidence of this disease.\nWhile people may tend to think of foodborne illnesses as associated with animal-based foods, most cases are now linked\nto produce. There have been serious, produce-related outbreaks associated with raw spinach in the United States and with\nvegetable sprouts in Germany, and these types of outbreaks have become more common. The raw spinach outbreak in\n2006 was produced by the bacterium E. coli serotype O157:H7. A serotype is a strain of bacteria that carries a set of\nsimilar antigens on its cell surface, and there are often many different serotypes of a bacterial species. Most E. coli are not\nparticularly dangerous to humans, but serotype O157:H7 can cause bloody diarrhea and is potentially fatal.\nAll types of food can potentially be contaminated with bacteria. Recent outbreaks of Salmonella reported by the CDC\noccurred in foods as diverse as peanut butter, alfalfa sprouts, and eggs. A deadly outbreak in Germany in 2010 was caused\nby E. coli contamination of vegetable sprouts (Figure 22.25). The strain that caused the outbreak was found to be a new\nserotype not previously involved in other outbreaks, which indicates that E. coli is continuously evolving.\n4.

The strain responsible, E. coli O104:H4, produces Shiga toxin,\na substance that inhibits protein synthesis in the host cell. The toxin (c) destroys red blood cells resulting in bloody\ndiarrhea. Deformed red blood cells clog the capillaries of the kidney, which can lead to kidney failure, as happened to\n845 patients in the 2011 outbreak. Kidney failure is usually reversible, but some patients experience kidney problems\nyears later. (credit c: NIDDK, NIH)\nEpidemiologist\nEpidemiology is the study of the occurrence, distribution, and determinants of health and disease in a\npopulation. It is, therefore, part of public health. An epidemiologist studies the frequency and distribution of\ndiseases within human populations and environments.\nEpidemiologists collect data about a particular disease and track its spread to identify the original mode\nof transmission. They sometimes work in close collaboration with historians to try to understand the way\na disease evolved geographically and over time, tracking the natural history of pathogens. They gather\ninformation from clinical records, patient interviews, surveillance, and any other available means. That\ninformation is used to develop strategies, such as vaccinations (Figure 22.26), and design public health\npolicies to reduce the incidence of a disease or to prevent its spread. Epidemiologists also conduct rapid\ninvestigations in case of an outbreak to recommend immediate measures to control it.\nAn epidemiologist has a bachelor\u2019s degree, plus a master\u2019s degree in public health (MPH). Many\nepidemiologists are also physicians (and have an M.D.), or they have a Ph.D. in an associated field, such\nas biology or microbiology.\nFigure 22.26 Vaccinations can slow the spread of communicable diseases.

        "summary": "Bacterial diseases have significantly impacted human history, causing epidemics and pandemics such as typhoid fever, bubonic plague, and tuberculosis, many of which have re-emerged despite advances in medicine. Epidemics occur when diseases spread rapidly within a population, pandemics affect multiple regions worldwide, and endemic diseases persist at low levels. Historical outbreaks, such as the Plague of Athens and the Black Death, devastated populations, while European colonization introduced deadly diseases to immunologically na\u00efve populations in the Americas. Emerging and re-emerging bacterial diseases, including zoonoses like brucellosis and Lyme disease, continue to pose global threats. Biofilms, which colonize medical devices, wounds, and food surfaces, are a major source of hospital-acquired and foodborne infections, and are highly resistant to antibiotics. Overuse and misuse of antibiotics in medicine and livestock have accelerated the evolution of resistant \u201csuperbugs\u201d such as MRSA, raising concerns of an antibiotic crisis. Foodborne bacterial pathogens like Salmonella and dangerous E. coli serotypes cause widespread illness, with recent outbreaks often linked to produce. Epidemiologists study the spread and control of such diseases, helping to guide public health measures."

Just think about the role of prokaryotes in\nbiogeochemical cycles.\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\n919\nCooperation between Bacteria and Eukaryotes: Nitrogen Fixation\nNitrogen is a very important element to living things, because it is part of nucleotides and amino acids that are the\nbuilding blocks of nucleic acids and proteins, respectively. Nitrogen is usually the most limiting element in terrestrial\necosystems, with atmospheric nitrogen, N2, providing the largest pool of available nitrogen. However, eukaryotes cannot\nuse atmospheric, gaseous nitrogen to synthesize macromolecules. Fortunately, nitrogen can be \u201cfixed,\u201d meaning it is\nconverted into ammonia (NH3) either biologically or abiotically. Abiotic nitrogen fixation occurs as a result of lightning or\nby industrial processes.\nBiological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is exclusively carried out by prokaryotes: soil bacteria, cyanobacteria, and Frankia\nspp. (filamentous bacteria interacting with actinorhizal plants such as alder, bayberry, and sweet fern). After photosynthesis,\nBNF is the second most important biological process on Earth. The equation representing the process is as follows\nN2  + 16ATP + 8e\u2212 + 8H+  \u2192 2NH3  + 16ADP + 16Pi + H2\nwhere Pi stands for inorganic phosphate. The total fixed nitrogen through BNF is about 100 to 180 million metric tons per\nyear. Biological processes contribute 65 percent of the nitrogen used in agriculture.\nCyanobacteria are the most important nitrogen fixers in aquatic environments. In soil, members of the genus Clostridium\nare examples of free-living, nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Other bacteria live symbiotically with legume plants, providing the\nmost important source of BNF. Symbionts may fix more nitrogen in soils than free-living organisms by a factor of 10. Soil\nbacteria, collectively called rhizobia, are able to symbiotically interact with legumes to form nodules, specialized structures\nwhere nitrogen fixation occurs (Figure 22.27). Nitrogenase, the enzyme that fixes nitrogen, is inactivated by oxygen, so\nthe nodule provides an oxygen-free area for nitrogen fixation to take place. This process provides a natural and inexpensive\nplant fertilizer, as it reduces atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, which is easily usable by plants. The use of legumes is an\nexcellent alternative to chemical fertilization and is of special interest to sustainable agriculture, which seeks to minimize\nthe use of chemicals and conserve natural resources. Through symbiotic nitrogen fixation, the plant benefits from using\nan endless source of nitrogen: the atmosphere. Bacteria benefit from using photosynthates (carbohydrates produced during\nphotosynthesis) from the plant and having a protected niche. Additionally, the soil benefits from being naturally fertilized.\nTherefore, the use of rhizobia as biofertilizers is a sustainable practice.\nWhy are legumes so important? Some, like soybeans, are key sources of agricultural protein. Some of the most important\ngrain legumes are soybean, peanuts, peas, chickpeas, and beans. Other legumes, such as alfalfa, are used to feed cattle.\nFigure 22.27 Soybean (Glycine max) is a legume that interacts symbiotically with the soil bacterium Bradyrhizobium\njaponicum to form specialized structures on the roots called nodules where nitrogen fixation occurs.

Genetic engineering, artificial selection,\nantibiotic production, and cell culture are current topics of study in biotechnology. However, humans have used prokaryotes\nbefore the term biotechnology was even coined. In addition, some of the goods and services are as simple as cheese, bread,\nand yogurt, which employ both bacteria and other microbes, such as yeast, a fungus.\n5. http://www.cbd.int/convention/articles/?a=cbd-02, United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity: Article 2: Use of Terms.\n920\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nCheese production began around 4,000\u20137,000 years ago when humans began to breed animals and process their milk.\nFermentation in this case preserves nutrients: Milk will spoil relatively quickly, but when processed as cheese, it is more\nstable Evidence suggests that cultured milk products, like yogurt, have existed for at least 4,000 years.\nUsing Prokaryotes to Clean up Our Planet: Bioremediation\nMicrobial bioremediation is the use of prokaryotes (or microbial metabolism) to remove pollutants. Bioremediation\nhas been used to remove agricultural chemicals (pesticides, fertilizers) that leach from soil into groundwater and the\nsubsurface. Certain toxic metals and oxides, such as selenium and arsenic compounds, can also be removed from water by\nbioremediation. The reduction of SeO4-2 to SeO3-2 and to Se0 (metallic selenium) is a method used to remove selenium\nions from water. Mercury is an example of a toxic metal that can be removed from an environment by bioremediation.\nAs an active ingredient of some pesticides, mercury is used in industry and is also a by-product of certain processes,\nsuch as battery production. Methyl mercury is usually present in very low concentrations in natural environments, but it\nis highly toxic because it accumulates in living tissues. Several species of bacteria can carry out the biotransformation of\ntoxic mercury into nontoxic forms. These bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, can convert Hg+2 into Hg0, which is\nnontoxic to humans.\nOne of the most useful and interesting examples of the use of prokaryotes for bioremediation purposes is the cleanup of\noil spills. The importance of prokaryotes to petroleum bioremediation has been demonstrated in several oil spills in recent\nyears, such as the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska (1989) (Figure 22.28), the Prestige oil spill in Spain (2002), the spill into\nthe Mediterranean from a Lebanon power plant (2006), and more recently, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of\nMexico (2010). To clean up these spills, bioremediation is promoted by the addition of inorganic nutrients that help bacteria\nto grow. Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria feed on hydrocarbons in the oil droplet, breaking down the hydrocarbons. Some\nspecies, such as Alcanivorax borkumensis, produce surfactants that solubilize the oil, whereas other bacteria degrade the\noil into carbon dioxide. In the case of oil spills in the ocean, ongoing, natural bioremediation tends to occur, inasmuch as\nthere are oil-consuming bacteria in the ocean prior to the spill. In addition to naturally occurring oil-degrading bacteria,\nhumans select and engineer bacteria that possess the same capability with increased efficacy and spectrum of hydrocarbon\ncompounds that can be processed. Under ideal conditions, it has been reported that up to 80 percent of the nonvolatile\ncomponents in oil can be degraded within one year of the spill. Other oil fractions containing aromatic and highly branched\nhydrocarbon chains are more difficult to remove and remain in the environment for longer periods of time.\nFigure 22.28 (a) Cleaning up oil after the Valdez spill in Alaska, workers hosed oil from beaches and then used a\nfloating boom to corral the oil, which was finally skimmed from the water surface. Some species of bacteria are able\nto solubilize and degrade the oil. (b) One of the most catastrophic consequences of oil spills is the damage to fauna.\n(credit a: modification of work by NOAA; credit b: modification of work by GOLUBENKOV, NGO: Saving Taman)\nChapter 22 | Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\n921\nA particularly fascinating example of our normal flora relates to our digestive systems. People who take high\ndoses of antibiotics tend to lose many of their normal gut bacteria, allowing a naturally antibiotic-resistant\nspecies called Clostridium difficile to overgrow and cause severe gastric problems, especially chronic\ndiarrhea. Obviously, trying to treat this problem with antibiotics only makes it worse. However, it has been\nsuccessfully treated by giving the patients fecal transplants from healthy donors to reestablish the normal\nintestinal microbial community. Scientists are also discovering that the absence of certain key microbes\nfrom our intestinal tract may set us up for a variety of problems including obesity, insulin resistance, and\nautoimmune disorders. Pictured here is a scanning electron micrograph of Clostridium difficile, a Gram-\npositive, rod-shaped bacterium that causes severe diarrhea. Infection commonly occurs after the normal gut\nfauna is eradicated by antibiotics.\nFigure 22.29 (credit: modification of work by CDC, HHS; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nWhat treatment is possible for people who have too much C. difficile in their digestive system?\na.\nBy taking antibiotics like metronidazole as treatment.\nb.\nThey can have a fecal transplant from a healthy donor.\nc.\nThey can have urine transplant from a healthy donor.\nd.\nBy taking probiotic supplements to restore microbial intestinal community.\nThink About It\nOne of your classmates claims that prokaryotes are always detrimental and pathogenic.

        "summary": "Most prokaryotes are not pathogenic and play essential roles in ecosystems and human life, including participation in key biogeochemical cycles. A major benefit they provide is biological nitrogen fixation, performed only by certain bacteria and cyanobacteria, which convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia usable by plants, often through symbiotic relationships with legumes that form root nodules. This natural fertilization supports sustainable agriculture and reduces the need for chemical fertilizers. Prokaryotes have also been used in food production for thousands of years, enabling the fermentation processes behind cheese, yogurt, and bread. Additionally, they are vital in bioremediation, using their metabolism to remove pollutants like pesticides, toxic metals, and oil from the environment; specially adapted microbes can break down hydrocarbons from oil spills. Prokaryotes in the human microbiome contribute to digestion, nutrient production, immune system training, and protection from pathogens, and restoring gut microbial balance\u2014such as with fecal transplants\u2014can treat conditions like Clostridium difficile overgrowth."

Without plants, our day-to-day lives would be impossible\nbecause without oxygen from photosynthesis, aerobic life cannot be sustained. From providing food and shelter to serving\nas a source of medicines, oils, perfumes, and industrial products, plants provide humans with numerous valuable resources.\nWhen you think of plants, those that first come to mind are likely to be vascular plants. These plants have tissues that\nconduct food and water (the word \u201cvascular\u201d means \u201chaving vessels\u201d). While each vascular plant species is unique, all\nare made up of a plant body consisting of stems, roots, and leaves. They also all transport water, minerals, and sugars\nproduced through photosynthesis through the plant body using the same mechanism, and they all respond to environmental\nfactors, such as light, gravity, competition, temperature, and predation. Scientists recently discovered that two plants, the\ngiant goldenrod and spicebush, each make five different compounds that disrupt the life cycles of insect pests. Further\ninvestigation into the chemicals could lead to a new class of pesticides.\n[1] You can read more about it in ScienceNews\nmagazine (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32pest) .\n1.

In addition all plant\nspecies respond to environmental factors, such as light, gravity, competition, temperature, and predation (see the Plant\nSensory Systems and Reponses module).

When different types of tissues work together\nto perform a unique function, they form an organ; organs working together form organ systems. Vascular plants have two\ndistinct organ systems: a shoot system, and a root system. The shoot system consists of two portions: the vegetative (non-\nreproductive) parts of the plant, such as the leaves and the stems, and the reproductive parts of the plant, which include\nflowers and fruits. The shoot system generally grows above ground, where it absorbs the light needed for photosynthesis.\nThe root system, which supports the plants and absorbs water and minerals, is usually underground. Figure 23.2 shows the\norgan systems of a typical plant.\nFigure 23.2 The shoot system of a plant consists of leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. The root system anchors the\nplant while absorbing water and minerals from the soil.\nPlant Tissues\nPlants are multicellular eukaryotes with tissue systems made of various cell types that carry out specific functions. Plant\ntissue systems fall into one of two general types: meristematic tissue, and permanent (or non-meristematic) tissue. Cells\nof the meristematic tissue are found in meristems, which are plant regions of continuous cell division and growth.\nMeristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated, and they continue to divide and\ncontribute to the growth of the plant. In contrast, permanent tissue consists of plant cells that are no longer actively\ndividing.\nMeristematic tissues consist of three types, based on their location in the plant. Apical meristems contain meristematic\ntissue located at the tips of stems and roots, which enable a plant to extend in length. Lateral meristems facilitate growth\nin thickness or girth in a maturing plant. Intercalary meristems occur only in monocots, at the bases of leaf blades and at\nnodes (the areas where leaves attach to a stem). This tissue enables the monocot leaf blade to increase in length from the\nleaf base; for example, it allows lawn grass leaves to elongate even after repeated mowing.\nMeristems produce cells that quickly differentiate, or specialize, and become permanent tissue. Such cells take on specific\nroles and lose their ability to divide further. They differentiate into three main types: dermal, vascular, and ground tissue.\nDermal tissue covers and protects the plant, and vascular tissue transports water, minerals, and sugars to different parts of\nthe plant. Ground tissue serves as a site for photosynthesis, provides a supporting matrix for the vascular tissue, and helps\nto store water and sugars.\nSecondary tissues are either simple (composed of similar cell types) or complex (composed of different cell types). Dermal\ntissue, for example, is a simple tissue that covers the outer surface of the plant and controls gas exchange. Vascular tissue\nis an example of a complex tissue, and is made of two specialized conducting tissues: xylem and phloem. Xylem tissue\ntransports water and nutrients from the roots to different parts of the plant, and includes three different cell types: vessel\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\n947\nelements and tracheids (both of which conduct water), and xylem parenchyma. Phloem tissue, which transports organic\ncompounds from the site of photosynthesis to other parts of the plant, consists of four different cell types: sieve cells (which\nconduct photosynthates), companion cells, phloem parenchyma, and phloem fibers. Unlike xylem conducting cells, phloem\nconducting cells are alive at maturity. The xylem and phloem always lie adjacent to each other (Figure 23.3). In stems, the\nxylem and the phloem form a structure called a vascular bundle; in roots, this is termed the vascular stele or vascular\ncylinder.\nFigure 23.3 This light micrograph shows a cross section of a squash (Curcurbita maxima) stem. Each teardrop-shaped\nvascular bundle consists of large xylem vessels toward the inside and smaller phloem cells toward the outside. Xylem\ncells, which transport water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the plant, are dead at functional maturity. Phloem\ncells, which transport sugars and other organic compounds from photosynthetic tissue to the rest of the plant, are\nliving.

A stem\nmay be unbranched, like that of a palm tree, or it may be highly branched, like that of a magnolia tree. The stem of the plant\nconnects the roots to the leaves, helping to transport absorbed water and minerals to different parts of the plant. It also helps\nto transport the products of photosynthesis, namely sugars, from the leaves to the rest of the plant.\nPlant stems, whether above or below ground, are characterized by the presence of nodes and internodes (Figure 23.4).\nNodes are points of attachment for leaves, aerial roots, and flowers. The stem region between two nodes is called an\ninternode. The stalk that extends from the stem to the base of the leaf is the petiole. An axillary bud is usually found in\nthe axil\u2014the area between the base of a leaf and the stem\u2014where it can give rise to a branch or a flower. The apex (tip) of\nthe shoot contains the apical meristem within the apical bud.\nFigure 23.4 Leaves are attached to the plant stem at areas called nodes. An internode is the stem region between two\nnodes. The petiole is the stalk connecting the leaf to the stem. The leaves just above the nodes arose from axillary\nbuds.\nStem Anatomy\nThe stem and other plant organs arise from the ground tissue, and are primarily made up of simple tissues formed from three\ntypes of cells: parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma cells.\nParenchyma cells are the most common plant cells (Figure 23.5). They are found in the stem, the root, the inside of the\nleaf, and the pulp of the fruit. Parenchyma cells are responsible for metabolic functions, such as photosynthesis, and they\nhelp repair and heal wounds. Some parenchyma cells also store starch.\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\n949\nFigure 23.5 The stem of common St John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) is shown in cross section in this light\nmicrograph.

(credit: Rolf-Dieter Mueller)\nCollenchyma cells are elongated cells with unevenly thickened walls (Figure 23.6). They provide structural support,\nmainly to the stem and leaves. These cells are alive at maturity and are usually found below the epidermis.

Both types have secondary cell walls that are thickened\nwith deposits of lignin, an organic compound that is a key component of wood. Fibers are long, slender cells; sclereids are\nsmaller-sized. Sclereids give pears their gritty texture. Humans use sclerenchyma fibers to make linen and rope (Figure\n23.7).\n950\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 23.7 The central pith and outer cortex of the (a) flax stem are made up of parenchyma cells.

Each is distinguished by\ncharacteristic cell types that perform specific tasks necessary for the plant\u2019s growth and survival.\nDermal Tissue\nThe dermal tissue of the stem consists primarily of epidermis, a single layer of cells covering and protecting the underlying\ntissue. Woody plants have a tough, waterproof outer layer of cork cells commonly known as bark, which further protects\nthe plant from damage. Epidermal cells are the most numerous and least differentiated of the cells in the epidermis. The\nepidermis of a leaf also contains openings known as stomata, through which the exchange of gases takes place (Figure\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\n951\n23.8). Two cells, known as guard cells, surround each leaf stoma, controlling its opening and closing and thus regulating\nthe uptake of carbon dioxide and the release of oxygen and water vapor. Trichomes are hair-like structures on the epidermal\nsurface. They help to reduce transpiration (the loss of water by aboveground plant parts), increase solar reflectance, and\nstore compounds that defend the leaves against predation by herbivores.\nFigure 23.8 Openings called stomata (singular: stoma) allow a plant to take up carbon dioxide and release oxygen and\nwater vapor. The (a) colorized scanning-electron micrograph shows a closed stoma of a dicot. Each stoma is flanked\nby two guard cells that regulate its (b) opening and closing. The (c) guard cells sit within the layer of epidermal cells\n(credit a: modification of work by Louisa Howard, Rippel Electron Microscope Facility, Dartmouth College; credit b:\nmodification of work by June Kwak, University of Maryland; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nVascular Tissue\nThe xylem and phloem that make up the vascular tissue of the stem are arranged in distinct strands called vascular bundles,\nwhich run up and down the length of the stem. When the stem is viewed in cross section, the vascular bundles of dicot\nstems are arranged in a ring. In plants with stems that live for more than one year, the individual bundles grow together\nand produce the characteristic growth rings. In monocot stems, the vascular bundles are randomly scattered throughout the\nground tissue (Figure 23.9).\nFigure 23.9 In (a) dicot stems, vascular bundles are arranged around the periphery of the ground tissue. The xylem\ntissue is located toward the interior of the vascular bundle, and phloem is located toward the exterior. Sclerenchyma\nfibers cap the vascular bundles. In (b) monocot stems, vascular bundles composed of xylem and phloem tissues are\nscattered throughout the ground tissue.\nXylem tissue has three types of cells: xylem parenchyma, tracheids, and vessel elements. The latter two types conduct water\nand are dead at maturity. Tracheids are xylem cells with thick secondary cell walls that are lignified. Water moves from one\ntracheid to another through regions on the side walls known as pits, where secondary walls are absent. Vessel elements are\n952\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nxylem cells with thinner walls; they are shorter than tracheids. Each vessel element is connected to the next by means of a\nperforation plate at the end walls of the element. Water moves through the perforation plates to travel up the plant.\nPhloem tissue is composed of sieve-tube cells, companion cells, phloem parenchyma, and phloem fibers. A series of sieve-\ntube cells (also called sieve-tube elements) are arranged end to end to make up a long sieve tube, which transports organic\nsubstances such as sugars and amino acids. The sugars flow from one sieve-tube cell to the next through perforated sieve\nplates, which are found at the end junctions between two cells. Although still alive at maturity, the nucleus and other cell\ncomponents of the sieve-tube cells have disintegrated. Companion cells are found alongside the sieve-tube cells, providing\nthem with metabolic support. The companion cells contain more ribosomes and mitochondria than the sieve-tube cells,\nwhich lack some cellular organelles.\nGround Tissue\nGround tissue is mostly made up of parenchyma cells, but may also contain collenchyma and sclerenchyma cells that help\nsupport the stem. The ground tissue towards the interior of the vascular tissue in a stem or root is known as pith, while the\nlayer of tissue between the vascular tissue and the epidermis is known as the cortex.\nGrowth in Stems\nGrowth in plants occurs as the stems and roots lengthen. Some plants, especially those that are woody, also increase in\nthickness during their life span. The increase in length of the shoot and the root is referred to as primary growth, and is the\nresult of cell division in the shoot apical meristem. Secondary growth is characterized by an increase in thickness or girth\nof the plant, and is caused by cell division in the lateral meristem. Figure 23.10 shows the areas of primary and secondary\ngrowth in a plant. Herbaceous plants mostly undergo primary growth, with hardly any secondary growth or increase in\nthickness. Secondary growth or \u201cwood\u201d is noticeable in woody plants; it occurs in some dicots, but occurs very rarely in\nmonocots.\nFigure 23.10 In woody plants, primary growth is followed by secondary growth, which allows the plant stem to increase\nin thickness or girth. Secondary vascular tissue is added as the plant grows, as well as a cork layer. The bark of a tree\nextends from the vascular cambium to the epidermis.\nSome plant parts, such as stems and roots, continue to grow throughout a plant\u2019s life: a phenomenon called indeterminate\ngrowth. Other plant parts, such as leaves and flowers, exhibit determinate growth, which ceases when a plant part reaches a\nparticular size.\nPrimary Growth\nMost primary growth occurs at the apices, or tips, of stems and roots. Primary growth is a result of rapidly dividing cells in\nthe apical meristems at the shoot tip and root tip. Subsequent cell elongation also contributes to primary growth. The growth\nof shoots and roots during primary growth enables plants to continuously seek water (roots) or sunlight (shoots).\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\n953\nThe influence of the apical bud on overall plant growth is known as apical dominance, which diminishes the growth of\naxillary buds that form along the sides of branches and stems. Most coniferous trees exhibit strong apical dominance,\nthus producing the typical conical Christmas tree shape. If the apical bud is removed, then the axillary buds will start\nforming lateral branches. Gardeners make use of this fact when they prune plants by cutting off the tops of branches, thus\nencouraging the axillary buds to grow out, giving the plant a bushy shape.\nWatch this BBC Nature video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/motion_plants) showing how time-lapse photography\ncaptures plant growth at high speed.\nThe video you watched showed time lapse photography of the growth of a stem. Which of these is a fast response in a\nplant that was not recorded in the video?\na.\nopening of a flower\nb.\ntendrils looping around a support\nc.\ngrowth of an apical bud\nd.\nclosing of leaflets on a lightly touched mimosa leaf\nSecondary Growth\nThe increase in stem thickness that results from secondary growth is due to the activity of the lateral meristems, which are\nlacking in herbaceous plants. Lateral meristems include the vascular cambium and, in woody plants, the cork cambium (see\nFigure 23.10). The vascular cambium is located just outside the primary xylem and to the interior of the primary phloem.\nThe cells of the vascular cambium divide and form secondary xylem (tracheids and vessel elements) to the inside, and\nsecondary phloem (sieve elements and companion cells) to the outside. The thickening of the stem that occurs in secondary\ngrowth is due to the formation of secondary phloem and secondary xylem by the vascular cambium, plus the action of\ncork cambium, which forms the tough outermost layer of the stem. The cells of the secondary xylem contain lignin, which\nprovides hardiness and strength.\nIn woody plants, cork cambium is the outermost lateral meristem. It produces cork cells (bark) containing a waxy substance\nknown as suberin that can repel water. The bark protects the plant against physical damage and helps reduce water loss.\nThe cork cambium also produces a layer of cells known as phelloderm, which grows inward from the cambium. The cork\ncambium, cork cells, and phelloderm are collectively termed the periderm. The periderm substitutes for the epidermis\nin mature plants. In some plants, the periderm has many openings, known as lenticels, which allow the interior cells to\nexchange gases with the outside atmosphere (Figure 23.11). This supplies oxygen to the living and metabolically active\ncells of the cortex, xylem and phloem.\n954\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 23.11 Lenticels on the bark of this cherry tree enable the woody stem to exchange gases with the surrounding\natmosphere. (credit: Roger Griffith)\nAnnual Rings\nThe activity of the vascular cambium gives rise to annual growth rings. During the spring growing season, cells of the\nsecondary xylem have a large internal diameter and their primary cell walls are not extensively thickened. This is known\nas early wood, or spring wood. During the fall season, the secondary xylem develops thickened cell walls, forming late\nwood, or autumn wood, which is denser than early wood. This alternation of early and late wood is due largely to a seasonal\ndecrease in the number of vessel elements and a seasonal increase in the number of tracheids. It results in the formation of\nan annual ring, which can be seen as a circular ring in the cross section of the stem (Figure 23.12). An examination of the\nnumber of annual rings and their nature (such as their size and cell wall thickness) can reveal the age of the tree and the\nprevailing climatic conditions during each season.\nFigure 23.12 The rate of wood growth increases in summer and decreases in winter, producing a characteristic ring\nfor each year of growth. Seasonal changes in weather patterns can also affect the growth rate\u2014note how the rings\nvary in thickness. (credit: Adrian Pingstone)\nStem Modifications\nSome plant species have modified stems that are especially suited to a particular habitat and environment (Figure 23.13).\nA rhizome is a modified stem that grows horizontally underground and has nodes and internodes. Vertical shoots may arise\nfrom the buds on the rhizome of some plants, such as ginger and ferns. Corms are similar to rhizomes, except they are\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\n955\nmore rounded and fleshy (such as in gladiolus). Corms contain stored food that enables some plants to survive the winter.\nStolons are stems that run almost parallel to the ground, or just below the surface, and can give rise to new plants at the\nnodes. Runners are a type of stolon that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes at varying intervals:\nstrawberries are an example. Tubers are modified stems that may store starch, as seen in the potato (Solanum sp.). Tubers\narise as swollen ends of stolons, and contain many adventitious or unusual buds (familiar to us as the \u201ceyes\u201d on potatoes). A\nbulb, which functions as an underground storage unit, is a modification of a stem that has the appearance of enlarged fleshy\nleaves emerging from the stem or surrounding the base of the stem, as seen in the iris.\nFigure 23.13 Stem modifications enable plants to thrive in a variety of environments. Shown are (a) ginger (Zingiber\nofficinale) rhizomes, (b) a carrion flower (Amorphophallus titanum) corm (c) Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) stolons,\n(d) strawberry (Fragaria ananassa) runners, (e) potato (Solanum tuberosum) tubers, and (f) red onion (Allium) bulbs.\n(credit a: modification of work by Maja Dumat; credit c: modification of work by Harry Rose; credit d: modification of\nwork by Rebecca Siegel; credit e: modification of work by Scott Bauer, USDA ARS; credit f: modification of work by\nStephen Ausmus, USDA ARS)\nWatch botanist Wendy Hodgson, of Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, Arizona, explain how agave plants were\ncultivated for food hundreds of years ago in the Arizona desert in this video: (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/\nancient_crop) Finding the Roots of an Ancient Crop.\nAgave plants were cultivated for hundreds of years by Pre-Columbian American populations.

        "summary": "Stems are part of a plant\u2019s shoot system, providing structural support and serving as conduits between roots and leaves for the transport of water, minerals, and the products of photosynthesis. They can be herbaceous or woody, above or below ground, and feature nodes, internodes, petioles, buds, and an apical meristem. Stems comprise three main tissue systems: dermal tissue (epidermis or cork layer in woody plants, with structures like stomata, guard cells, and trichomes), vascular tissue (xylem for water and mineral transport, phloem for sugars and organic compounds, arranged in vascular bundles), and ground tissue (pith and cortex, mainly parenchyma with supportive collenchyma and sclerenchyma). Growth may be primary (lengthening via apical meristems) or secondary (thickening via vascular and cork cambia, producing wood, bark, and annual rings). Some stems are modified for specialized functions, including rhizomes, corms, stolons, runners, tubers, bulbs, tendrils for climbing, and thorns for protection."

(credit b: modification of work by \u201cAusten Squarepants\u201d/Flickr)\nRoot Growth and Anatomy\nRoot growth begins with seed germination. When the plant embryo emerges from the seed, the radicle of the embryo forms\nthe root system. The tip of the root is protected by the root cap, a structure exclusive to roots and unlike any other plant\nstructure. The root cap is continuously replaced because it gets damaged easily as the root pushes through soil. The root tip\ncan be divided into three zones: a zone of cell division, a zone of elongation, and a zone of maturation and differentiation\n(Figure 23.16). The zone of cell division is closest to the root tip; it is made up of the actively dividing cells of the\nroot meristem. The zone of elongation is where the newly formed cells increase in length, thereby lengthening the root.\nBeginning at the first root hair is the zone of cell maturation where the root cells begin to differentiate into special cell types.\nAll three zones are in the first centimeter or so of the root tip.\nFigure 23.16 A longitudinal view of the root reveals the zones of cell division, elongation, and maturation. Cell division\noccurs in the apical meristem.\n958\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nThe root has an outer layer of cells called the epidermis, which surrounds areas of ground tissue and vascular tissue. The\nepidermis provides protection and helps in absorption. Root hairs, which are extensions of root epidermal cells, increase\nthe surface area of the root, greatly contributing to the absorption of water and minerals.\nInside the root, the ground tissue forms two regions: the cortex and the pith (Figure 23.17). Compared to stems, roots\nhave lots of cortex and little pith. Both regions include cells that store photosynthetic products. The cortex is between the\nepidermis and the vascular tissue, whereas the pith lies between the vascular tissue and the center of the root.\nFigure 23.17 Staining reveals different cell types in this light micrograph of a wheat (Triticum) root cross section.\nSclerenchyma cells of the exodermis and xylem cells stain red, and phloem cells stain blue. Other cell types stain\nblack. The stele, or vascular tissue, is the area inside endodermis (indicated by a green ring). Root hairs are visible\noutside the epidermis. (credit: scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nThe vascular tissue in the root is arranged in the inner portion of the root, which is called the stele (Figure 23.18). A layer\nof cells known as the endodermis separates the stele from the ground tissue in the outer portion of the root. The endodermis\nis exclusive to roots, and serves as a checkpoint for materials entering the root\u2019s vascular system. A waxy substance called\nsuberin is present on the walls of the endodermal cells. This waxy region, known as the Casparian strip, forces water and\nsolutes to cross the plasma membranes of endodermal cells instead of slipping between the cells. This ensures that only\nmaterials required by the root pass through the endodermis, while toxic substances and pathogens are generally excluded.\nThe outermost cell layer of the root\u2019s vascular tissue is the pericycle, an area that can give rise to lateral roots. In dicot roots,\nthe xylem and phloem of the stele are arranged alternately in an X shape, whereas in monocot roots, the vascular tissue is\narranged in a ring around the pith.\nFigure 23.18 In (left) typical dicots, the vascular tissue forms an X shape in the center of the root. In (right) typical\nmonocots, the phloem cells and the larger xylem cells form a characteristic ring around the central pith.\nRoot Modifications\nRoot structures may be modified for specific purposes. For example, some roots are bulbous and store starch.

Tap roots, such as\ncarrots, turnips, and beets, are examples of roots that are modified for food storage (Figure 23.19).\nFigure 23.19 Many vegetables are modified roots.\nEpiphytic roots enable a plant to grow on another plant.

Other leaves may have small hairs called trichomes on the leaf surface; not only do trichomes\nalso help reduce water loss; they also protect the leaf from herbivory by restricting insect movements or by storing toxic or\nbad-tasting chemicals.\nThe information presented in this module does not align to the content and AP\u00ae Learning Objectives outlined in the AP\u00ae\nCurriculum Framework. The role of stomata, guard cells, and trichomes in transpiration are explored in the Transport of\nWater and Solutes in Plants module.\nLeaves are the main sites for photosynthesis: the process by which plants synthesize food. Most leaves are usually green,\ndue to the presence of chlorophyll in the leaf cells. However, some leaves may have different colors, caused by other plant\npigments that mask the green chlorophyll.\nThe thickness, shape, and size of leaves are adapted to the environment. Each variation helps a plant species maximize its\nchances of survival in a particular habitat. Usually, the leaves of plants growing in tropical rainforests have larger surface\nareas than those of plants growing in deserts or very cold conditions, which are likely to have a smaller surface area to\nminimize water loss.\nStructure of a Typical Leaf\nEach leaf typically has a leaf blade called the lamina, which is also the widest part of the leaf. Some leaves are attached to\nthe plant stem by a petiole. Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile\nleaves. Small green appendages usually found at the base of the petiole are known as stipules. Most leaves have a midrib,\nwhich travels the length of the leaf and branches to each side to produce veins of vascular tissue. The edge of the leaf is\ncalled the margin. Figure 23.21 shows the structure of a typical eudicot leaf.\nFigure 23.21 Deceptively simple in appearance, a leaf is a highly efficient structure.\nWithin each leaf, the vascular tissue forms veins. The arrangement of veins in a leaf is called the venation pattern. Monocots\nand dicots differ in their patterns of venation (Figure 23.22). Monocots have parallel venation; the veins run in straight\nlines across the length of the leaf without converging at a point. In dicots, however, the veins of the leaf have a net-like\nappearance, forming a pattern known as reticulate venation. One extant plant, the Ginkgo biloba, has dichotomous venation\nwhere the veins fork.\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\n961\nFigure 23.22 (a) Tulip (Tulipa), a monocot, has leaves with parallel venation. The netlike venation in this (b) linden\n(Tilia cordata) leaf distinguishes it as a dicot. The (c) Ginkgo biloba tree has dichotomous venation.

The number and placement of a plant\u2019s leaves will vary\ndepending on the species, with each species exhibiting a characteristic leaf arrangement. Leaves are classified as either\nalternate, spiral, or opposite. Plants that have only one leaf per node have leaves that are said to be either alternate\u2014meaning\nthe leaves alternate on each side of the stem in a flat plane\u2014or spiral, meaning the leaves are arrayed in a spiral along the\nstem. In an opposite leaf arrangement, two leaves arise at the same point, with the leaves connecting opposite each other\nalong the branch. If there are three or more leaves connected at a node, the leaf arrangement is classified as whorled.\nLeaf Form\nLeaves may be simple or compound (Figure 23.23). In a simple leaf, the blade is either completely undivided\u2014as in the\nbanana leaf\u2014or it has lobes, but the separation does not reach the midrib, as in the maple leaf. In a compound leaf, the\nleaf blade is completely divided, forming leaflets, as in the locust tree. Each leaflet may have its own stalk, but is attached\nto the rachis. A palmately compound leaf resembles the palm of a hand, with leaflets radiating outwards from one point\nExamples include the leaves of poison ivy, the buckeye tree, or the familiar houseplant Schefflera sp. (common name\n\u201cumbrella plant\u201d). Pinnately compound leaves take their name from their feather-like appearance; the leaflets are arranged\nalong the midrib, as in rose leaves (Rosa sp.), or the leaves of hickory, pecan, ash, or walnut trees.\n962\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 23.23 Leaves may be simple or compound. In simple leaves, the lamina is continuous. The (a) banana plant\n(Musa sp.) has simple leaves. In compound leaves, the lamina is separated into leaflets. Compound leaves may be\npalmate or pinnate. In (b) palmately compound leaves, such as those of the horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum),\nthe leaflets branch from the petiole. In (c) pinnately compound leaves, the leaflets branch from the midrib, as on a scrub\nhickory (Carya floridana). The (d) honey locust has double compound leaves, in which leaflets branch from the veins.\n(credit a: modification of work by \"BazzaDaRambler\"/Flickr; credit b: modification of work by Roberto Verzo; credit c:\nmodification of work by Eric Dion; credit d: modification of work by Valerie Lykes)\nLeaf Structure and Function\nThe outermost layer of the leaf is the epidermis; it is present on both sides of the leaf and is called the upper and lower\nepidermis, respectively. Botanists call the upper side the adaxial surface (or adaxis) and the lower side the abaxial surface\n(or abaxis). The epidermis helps in the regulation of gas exchange. It contains stomata (Figure 23.24): openings through\nwhich the exchange of gases takes place. Two guard cells surround each stoma, regulating its opening and closing.\nFigure 23.24 Visualized at 500x with a scanning electron microscope, several stomata are clearly visible on (a) the\nsurface of this sumac (Rhus glabra) leaf. At 5,000x magnification, the guard cells of (b) a single stoma from lyre-leaved\nsand cress (Arabidopsis lyrata) have the appearance of lips that surround the opening. In this (c) light micrograph\ncross-section of an A. lyrata leaf, the guard cell pair is visible along with the large, sub-stomatal air space in the leaf.\n(credit: modification of work by Robert R. Wise; part c scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nThe epidermis is usually one cell layer thick; however, in plants that grow in very hot or very cold conditions, the epidermis\nmay be several layers thick to protect against excessive water loss from transpiration. A waxy layer known as the cuticle\ncovers the leaves of all plant species. The cuticle reduces the rate of water loss from the leaf surface. Other leaves may have\nsmall hairs (trichomes) on the leaf surface. Trichomes help to deter herbivory by restricting insect movements, or by storing\ntoxic or bad-tasting compounds; they can also reduce the rate of transpiration by blocking air flow across the leaf surface\n(Figure 23.25).\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\n963\nFigure 23.25 Trichomes give leaves a fuzzy appearance as in this (a) sundew (Drosera sp.). Leaf trichomes include (b)\nbranched trichomes on the leaf of Arabidopsis lyrata and (c) multibranched trichomes on a mature Quercus marilandica\nleaf. (credit a: John Freeland; credit b, c: modification of work by Robert R. Wise; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nBelow the epidermis of dicot leaves are layers of cells known as the mesophyll, or \u201cmiddle leaf.\u201d The mesophyll of most\nleaves typically contains two arrangements of parenchyma cells: the palisade parenchyma and spongy parenchyma (Figure\n23.26). The palisade parenchyma (also called the palisade mesophyll) has column-shaped, tightly packed cells, and may\nbe present in one, two, or three layers. Below the palisade parenchyma are loosely arranged cells of an irregular shape.\nThese are the cells of the spongy parenchyma (or spongy mesophyll). The air space found between the spongy parenchyma\ncells allows gaseous exchange between the leaf and the outside atmosphere through the stomata. In aquatic plants, the\nintercellular spaces in the spongy parenchyma help the leaf float. Both layers of the mesophyll contain many chloroplasts.\nGuard cells are the only epidermal cells to contain chloroplasts.\n964\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 23.26 In the (a) leaf drawing, the central mesophyll is sandwiched between an upper and lower epidermis. The\nmesophyll has two layers: an upper palisade layer comprised of tightly packed, columnar cells, and a lower spongy\nlayer, comprised of loosely packed, irregularly shaped cells. Stomata on the leaf underside allow gas exchange. A\nwaxy cuticle covers all aerial surfaces of land plants to minimize water loss. These leaf layers are clearly visible in\nthe (b) scanning electron micrograph. The numerous small bumps in the palisade parenchyma cells are chloroplasts.\nChloroplasts are also present in the spongy parenchyma, but are not as obvious. The bumps protruding from the lower\nsurface of the leave are glandular trichomes, which differ in structure from the stalked trichomes in Figure 23.25. (credit\nb: modification of work by Robert R. Wise)\nLike the stem, the leaf contains vascular bundles composed of xylem and phloem (Figure 23.27). The xylem consists of\ntracheids and vessels, which transport water and minerals to the leaves. The phloem transports the photosynthetic products\nfrom the leaf to the other parts of the plant. A single vascular bundle, no matter how large or small, always contains both\nxylem and phloem tissues.\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\n965\nFigure 23.27 This scanning electron micrograph shows xylem and phloem in the leaf vascular bundle from the lyre-\nleaved sand cress (Arabidopsis lyrata). (credit: modification of work by Robert R. Wise; scale-bar data from Matt\nRussell)\nLeaf Adaptations\nConiferous plant species that thrive in cold environments, like spruce, fir, and pine, have leaves that are reduced in size and\nneedle-like in appearance. These needle-like leaves have sunken stomata and a smaller surface area: two attributes that aid\nin reducing water loss. In hot climates, plants such as cacti have leaves that are reduced to spines, which in combination\nwith their succulent stems, help to conserve water. Many aquatic plants have leaves with wide lamina that can float on the\nsurface of the water, and a thick waxy cuticle on the leaf surface that repels water.\nWatch \u201cThe Pale Pitcher Plant\u201d episode of the video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/plants_cool_too) series Plants Are\nCool, Too, a Botanical Society of America video about a carnivorous plant species found in Louisiana.\nHow do pale pitcher plants (Sarracinia alata) make sure that insects do not escape after consuming the nectar that\nattracted them?\na.\nThe insects are skewered on spikes and thorns that rim the funnel-shaped leaf.\nb.\nThe insects ingest narcotics secreted by the leaf and fall into the funnel-shaped leaf.\nc.\nThe insects are poisoned by lethal compounds in the nectar.\nd.\nThe insects are immobilized by sticky substances on the rim of the funnel-shaped leaf.\n966\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nPlant Adaptations in Resource-Deficient Environments\nRoots, stems, and leaves are structured to ensure that a plant can obtain the required sunlight, water, soil\nnutrients, and oxygen resources. Some remarkable adaptations have evolved to enable plant species to\nthrive in less than ideal habitats, where one or more of these resources is in short supply.\nIn tropical rainforests, light is often scarce, since many trees and plants grow close together and block much\nof the sunlight from reaching the forest floor. Many tropical plant species have exceptionally broad leaves to\nmaximize the capture of sunlight. Other species are epiphytes: plants that grow on other plants that serve\nas a physical support. Such plants are able to grow high up in the canopy atop the branches of other trees,\nwhere sunlight is more plentiful. Epiphytes live on rain and minerals collected in the branches and leaves\nof the supporting plant. Bromeliads (members of the pineapple family), ferns, and orchids are examples of\ntropical epiphytes (Figure 23.28). Many epiphytes have specialized tissues that enable them to efficiently\ncapture and store water.\nFigure 23.28 One of the most well known bromeliads is Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides), seen here in an\noak tree. (credit: Kristine Paulus)\nSome plants have special adaptations that help them to survive in nutrient-poor environments. Carnivorous\nplants, such as the Venus flytrap and the pitcher plant (Figure 23.29), grow in bogs where the soil is low\nin nitrogen. In these plants, leaves are modified to capture insects. The insect-capturing leaves may have\nevolved to provide these plants with a supplementary source of much-needed nitrogen.\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\n967\nFigure 23.29 The (a) Venus flytrap has modified leaves that can capture insects. When an unlucky insect touches\nthe trigger hairs inside the leaf, the trap suddenly closes. The opening of the (b) pitcher plant is lined with a\nslippery wax. Insects crawling on the lip slip and fall into a pool of water in the bottom of the pitcher, where they\nare digested by bacteria. The plant then absorbs the smaller molecules. (credit a: modification of work by Peter\nShanks; credit b: modification of work by Tim Mansfield)\nMany swamp plants have adaptations that enable them to thrive in wet areas, where their roots grow\nsubmerged underwater. In these aquatic areas, the soil is unstable and little oxygen is available to reach\nthe roots. Trees such as mangroves (Rhizophora sp.) growing in coastal waters produce aboveground\nroots that help support the tree (Figure 23.30). Some species of mangroves, as well as cypress trees,\nhave pneumatophores: upward-growing roots containing pores and pockets of tissue specialized for gas\nexchange. Wild rice is an aquatic plant with large air spaces in the root cortex. The air-filled tissue\u2014called\naerenchyma\u2014provides a path for oxygen to diffuse down to the root tips, which are embedded in oxygen-\npoor bottom sediments.\nHow do pale pitcher plants (Sarracinia alata) make sure that insects do not escape after consuming the nectar that\nattracted them?\na.\nThe insects are skewered on spikes and thorns that rim the funnel-shaped leaf.\nb.\nThe insects ingest narcotics secreted by the leaf and fall into the funnel-shaped leaf.\nc.\nThe insects are poisoned by lethal compounds in the nectar.\nd.\nThe insects are immobilized by sticky substances on the rim of the funnel-shaped leaf.\nFigure 23.30 The branches of (a) mangrove trees develop aerial roots, which descend to the ground and\nhelp to anchor the trees. (b) Cypress trees and some mangrove species have upward-growing roots called\npneumatophores that are involved in gas exchange. Aquatic plants such as (c) wild rice have large spaces in the\nroot cortex called aerenchyma, visualized here using scanning electron microscopy.

        "summary": "Leaves are the primary sites of photosynthesis and exhibit a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and structures adapted to different environments. A typical leaf consists of a lamina (blade), petiole (or is sessile), stipules, a midrib with vascular veins, and a margin, with venation patterns varying between monocots (parallel) and dicots (reticulate), while Ginkgo biloba displays dichotomous venation. Leaf arrangement on stems (phyllotaxy) can be alternate, spiral, opposite, or whorled, and leaf forms may be simple or compound (palmate, pinnate, or double compound). The epidermis, covered by a waxy cuticle and sometimes with trichomes, protects against water loss and herbivory; stomata with guard cells regulate gas exchange. Inside, mesophyll tissue contains chloroplast-rich palisade and spongy parenchyma, with air spaces aiding gas exchange or buoyancy in aquatic plants, and vascular bundles of xylem and phloem transport water, minerals, and photosynthates. Leaf adaptations include needle-like leaves in conifers to reduce water loss, cactus spines for water conservation, broad floating leaves in aquatic plants, and specialized forms in resource-poor habitats such as epiphytic leaves for capturing water, or carnivorous leaves (Venus flytrap, pitcher plant) for supplementing nitrogen intake. Some species, like mangroves and swamp plants, exhibit structural adaptations such as pneumatophores and aerenchyma to survive in low-oxygen or unstable substrates."

The phloem and xylem are the main tissues responsible for this movement. Water potential, evapotranspiration, and\nstomatal regulation influence how water and nutrients are transported in plants. To understand how these processes work,\nwe must first understand the energetics of water potential.\nWater Potential\nPlants are phenomenal hydraulic engineers. Using only the basic laws of physics and the simple manipulation of potential\nenergy, plants can move water to the top of a 116-meter-tall tree (Figure 23.31a). Plants can also use hydraulics to generate\nenough force to split rocks and buckle sidewalks (Figure 23.31b). Plants achieve this because of water potential.\nFigure 23.31 With heights nearing 116 meters, (a) coastal redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) are the tallest trees in the\nworld. Plant roots can easily generate enough force to (b) buckle and break concrete sidewalks, much to the dismay of\nhomeowners and city maintenance departments. (credit a: modification of work by Bernt Rostad; credit b: modification\nof work by Pedestrians Educating Drivers on Safety, Inc.)\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\n971\nWater potential is a measure of the potential energy in water. Plant physiologists are not interested in the energy in any one\nparticular aqueous system, but are very interested in water movement between two systems. In practical terms, therefore,\nwater potential is the difference in potential energy between a given water sample and pure water (at atmospheric pressure\nand ambient temperature). Water potential is denoted by the Greek letter \u03a8 (psi) and is expressed in units of pressure\n(pressure is a form of energy) called megapascals (MPa). The potential of pure water (\u03a8wpure H2O) is, by convenience of\ndefinition, designated a value of zero (even though pure water contains plenty of potential energy, that energy is ignored).\nWater potential values for the water in a plant root, stem, or leaf are therefore expressed relative to \u03a8wpure H2O.\nThe water potential in plant solutions is influenced by solute concentration, pressure, gravity, and factors called matrix\neffects. Water potential can be broken down into its individual components using the following equation:\n\u03a8system = \u03a8total = \u03a8s + \u03a8p + \u03a8g + \u03a8m\nwhere \u03a8s, \u03a8p, \u03a8g, and \u03a8m refer to the solute, pressure, gravity, and matric potentials, respectively. \u201cSystem\u201d can refer to\nthe water potential of the soil water (\u03a8soil), root water (\u03a8root), stem water (\u03a8stem), leaf water (\u03a8leaf) or the water in the\natmosphere (\u03a8atmosphere): whichever aqueous system is under consideration. As the individual components change, they\nraise or lower the total water potential of a system. When this happens, water moves to equilibrate, moving from the system\nor compartment with a higher water potential to the system or compartment with a lower water potential. This brings the\ndifference in water potential between the two systems (\u0394\u03a8) back to zero (\u0394\u03a8 = 0). Therefore, for water to move through\nthe plant from the soil to the air (a process called transpiration), \u03a8soil must be > \u03a8root > \u03a8stem > \u03a8leaf > \u03a8atmosphere.\nWater only moves in response to \u0394\u03a8, not in response to the individual components. However, because the individual\ncomponents influence the total \u03a8system, by manipulating the individual components (especially \u03a8s), a plant can control water\nmovement.\nSolute Potential\nSolute potential (\u03a8s), also called osmotic potential, is negative in a plant cell and zero in distilled water. Typical values for\ncell cytoplasm are \u20130.5 to \u20131.0 MPa. Solutes reduce water potential (resulting in a negative \u03a8w) by consuming some of the\npotential energy available in the water. Solute molecules can dissolve in water because water molecules can bind to them\nvia hydrogen bonds; a hydrophobic molecule like oil, which cannot bind to water, cannot go into solution. The energy in the\nhydrogen bonds between solute molecules and water is no longer available to do work in the system because it is tied up in\nthe bond. In other words, the amount of available potential energy is reduced when solutes are added to an aqueous system.\nThus, \u03a8s decreases with increasing solute concentration. Because \u03a8s is one of the four components of \u03a8system or \u03a8total, a\ndecrease in \u03a8s will cause a decrease in \u03a8total. The internal water potential of a plant cell is more negative than pure water\nbecause of the cytoplasm\u2019s high solute content (Figure 23.32). Because of this difference in water potential water will move\nfrom the soil into a plant\u2019s root cells via the process of osmosis. This is why solute potential is sometimes called osmotic\npotential.\nPlant cells can metabolically manipulate \u03a8s (and by extension, \u03a8total) by adding or removing solute molecules. Therefore,\nplants have control over \u03a8total via their ability to exert metabolic control over \u03a8s.\n972\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 23.32 In this example with a semipermeable membrane between two aqueous systems, water will move\nfrom a region of higher to lower water potential until equilibrium is reached. Solutes (\u03a8s), pressure (\u03a8p), and\ngravity (\u03a8g) influence total water potential for each side of the tube (\u03a8totalright or left), and therefore, the difference\nbetween \u03a8total on each side (\u0394\u03a8). (\u03a8m , the potential due to interaction of water with solid substrates, is ignored\nin this example because glass is not especially hydrophilic). Water moves in response to the difference in water\npotential between two systems (the left and right sides of the tube).\nPositive water potential is applied on the left side of a tube by increasing \u03a8p so that the water level rises on the right\nside. The equation for water potential is: \u03a8system = \u03a8total = \u03a8s + \u03a8p + \u03a8g + \u03a8m where \u03a8s, \u03a8p, \u03a8g, and \u03a8m refer to\nthe solute, pressure, gravity, and matric potentials, respectively. Could you equalize the water level on each side of the\ntube by adding solute?\na.\nYes, water level can be equalized by adding solute to the right side of the tube so that water moves toward\nthe left until the water levels are equal.\nb.\nNo, water level cannot be equalized on both sides of the tubes by adding solutes with no other action.\nc.\nYes, water level can be equalized by adding solute to the left side of the tube so that water moves toward the\nleft until the water levels are equal.\nd.\nNo, water level cannot be equalized by adding solutes because solutes are always pulled down by gravity,\nthereby not letting water equalize.\nPressure Potential\nPressure potential (\u03a8p), also called turgor potential, may be positive or negative (Figure 23.32). Because pressure is an\nexpression of energy, the higher the pressure, the more potential energy in a system, and vice versa. Therefore, a positive\n\u03a8p (compression) increases \u03a8total, and a negative \u03a8p (tension) decreases \u03a8total. Positive pressure inside cells is contained\nby the cell wall, producing turgor pressure. Pressure potentials are typically around 0.6\u20130.8 MPa, but can reach as high as\n1.5 MPa in a well-watered plant. A \u03a8p of 1.5 MPa equates to 210 pounds per square inch (1.5 MPa x 140 lb in-2 MPa-1 =\n210 lb/in-2). As a comparison, most automobile tires are kept at a pressure of 30\u201334 psi. An example of the effect of turgor\npressure is the wilting of leaves and their restoration after the plant has been watered (Figure 23.33). Water is lost from the\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\n973\nleaves via transpiration (approaching \u03a8p = 0 MPa at the wilting point) and restored by uptake via the roots.\nA plant can manipulate \u03a8p via its ability to manipulate \u03a8s and by the process of osmosis. If a plant cell increases the\ncytoplasmic solute concentration, \u03a8s will decline, \u03a8total will decline, the \u0394\u03a8 between the cell and the surrounding tissue\nwill decline, water will move into the cell by osmosis, and \u03a8p will increase. \u03a8p is also under indirect plant control via the\nopening and closing of stomata. Stomatal openings allow water to evaporate from the leaf, reducing \u03a8p and \u03a8total of the leaf\nand increasing \u0394\u03a8 between the water in the leaf and the petiole, thereby allowing water to flow from the petiole into the\nleaf.\nFigure 23.33 When (a) total water potential (\u03a8total) is lower outside the cells than inside, water moves out of the cells\nand the plant wilts. When (b) the total water potential is higher outside the plant cells than inside, water moves into the\ncells, resulting in turgor pressure (\u03a8p) and keeping the plant erect. (credit: modification of work by Victor M. Vicente\nSelvas)\nGravity Potential\nGravity potential (\u03a8g) is always negative to zero in a plant with no height. It always removes or consumes potential energy\nfrom the system. The force of gravity pulls water downwards to the soil, reducing the total amount of potential energy in\nthe water in the plant (\u03a8total). The taller the plant, the taller the water column, and the more influential \u03a8g becomes. On\na cellular scale and in short plants, this effect is negligible and easily ignored. However, over the height of a tall tree like\na giant coastal redwood, the gravitational pull of \u20130.1 MPa m-1 is equivalent to an extra 1 MPa of resistance that must be\novercome for water to reach the leaves of the tallest trees. Plants are unable to manipulate \u03a8g.\nMatric Potential\nMatric potential (\u03a8m) is always negative to zero. In a dry system, it can be as low as \u20132 MPa in a dry seed, and it is zero in\na water-saturated system. The binding of water to a matrix always removes or consumes potential energy from the system.\n\u03a8m is similar to solute potential because it involves tying up the energy in an aqueous system by forming hydrogen bonds\nbetween the water and some other component. However, in solute potential, the other components are soluble, hydrophilic\nsolute molecules, whereas in \u03a8m, the other components are insoluble, hydrophilic molecules of the plant cell wall. Every\nplant cell has a cellulosic cell wall and the cellulose in the cell walls is hydrophilic, producing a matrix for adhesion of\nwater: hence the name matric potential. \u03a8m is very large (negative) in dry tissues such as seeds or drought-affected soils.\nHowever, it quickly goes to zero as the seed takes up water or the soil hydrates. \u03a8m cannot be manipulated by the plant and\nis typically ignored in well-watered roots, stems, and leaves.\nMovement of Water and Minerals in the Xylem\nSolutes, pressure, gravity, and matric potential are all important for the transport of water in plants. Water moves from an\narea of higher total water potential (higher Gibbs free energy) to an area of lower total water potential. Gibbs free energy is\nthe energy associated with a chemical reaction that can be used to do work. This is expressed as \u0394\u03a8.\nTranspiration is the loss of water from the plant through evaporation at the leaf surface. It is the main driver of water\nmovement in the xylem. Transpiration is caused by the evaporation of water at the leaf\u2013atmosphere interface; it creates\nnegative pressure (tension) equivalent to \u20132 MPa at the leaf surface. This value varies greatly depending on the vapor\npressure deficit, which can be negligible at high relative humidity (RH) and substantial at low RH. Water from the roots is\npulled up by this tension. At night, when stomata shut and transpiration stops, the water is held in the stem and leaf by the\nadhesion of water to the cell walls of the xylem vessels and tracheids, and the cohesion of water molecules to each other.\nThis is called the cohesion\u2013tension theory of sap ascent.\nInside the leaf at the cellular level, water on the surface of mesophyll cells saturates the cellulose microfibrils of the primary\ncell wall. The leaf contains many large intercellular air spaces for the exchange of oxygen for carbon dioxide, which is\n974\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nrequired for photosynthesis. The wet cell wall is exposed to this leaf internal air space, and the water on the surface of the\ncells evaporates into the air spaces, decreasing the thin film on the surface of the mesophyll cells. This decrease creates a\ngreater tension on the water in the mesophyll cells (Figure 23.34), thereby increasing the pull on the water in the xylem\nvessels. The xylem vessels and tracheids are structurally adapted to cope with large changes in pressure. Rings in the vessels\nmaintain their tubular shape, much like the rings on a vacuum cleaner hose keep the hose open while it is under pressure.\nSmall perforations between vessel elements reduce the number and size of gas bubbles that can form via a process called\ncavitation. The formation of gas bubbles in xylem interrupts the continuous stream of water from the base to the top of the\nplant, causing a break termed an embolism in the flow of xylem sap. The taller the tree, the greater the tension forces needed\nto pull water, and the more cavitation events. In larger trees, the resulting embolisms can plug xylem vessels, making them\nnon-functional.\nFigure 23.34 The cohesion\u2013tension theory of sap ascent is shown. Evaporation from the mesophyll cells\nproduces a negative water potential gradient that causes water to move upwards from the roots through the xylem.\nWhich statement is false?\na.\nNegative water potential draws water into the root hairs, cohesion and adhesion draw water up the xylem,\nand transpiration draws water from the leaf.\nb.\nNegative water potential draws water into the root hairs, cohesion and adhesion draw water up the phloem,\nand transpiration draws water from the leaf.\nc.\nWater potential decreases from the roots to the top of the plant.\nd.\nWater enters the plant through the root hairs and exits through stomata.\nTranspiration\u2014the loss of water vapor to the atmosphere through stomata\u2014is a passive process, meaning that metabolic\nenergy in the form of ATP is not required for water movement. The energy driving transpiration is the difference in energy\nbetween the water in the soil and the water in the atmosphere. However, transpiration is tightly controlled.\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\n975\nControl of Transpiration\nThe atmosphere to which the leaf is exposed drives transpiration, but also causes massive water loss from the plant. Up to\n90 percent of the water taken up by roots may be lost through transpiration.\nLeaves are covered by a waxy cuticle on the outer surface that prevents the loss of water. Regulation of transpiration,\ntherefore, is achieved primarily through the opening and closing of stomata on the leaf surface. Stomata are surrounded by\ntwo specialized cells called guard cells, which open and close in response to environmental cues such as light intensity and\nquality, leaf water status, and carbon dioxide concentrations. Stomata must open to allow air containing carbon dioxide and\noxygen to diffuse into the leaf for photosynthesis and respiration. When stomata are open, however, water vapor is lost to\nthe external environment, increasing the rate of transpiration. Therefore, plants must maintain a balance between efficient\nphotosynthesis and water loss.\nPlants have evolved over time to adapt to their local environment and reduce transpiration(Figure 23.35). Desert plants\n(xerophytes) and plants that grow on other plants (epiphytes) have limited access to water. Such plants usually have a\nmuch thicker waxy cuticle than those growing in more moderate, well-watered environments (mesophytes). Aquatic plants\n(hydrophytes) also have their own set of anatomical and morphological leaf adaptations.\nFigure 23.35 Plants are suited to their local environment. (a) Xerophytes, like this prickly pear cactus (Opuntia\nsp.) and (b) epiphytes such as this tropical Aeschynanthus perrottetii have adapted to very limited water resources.\nThe leaves of a prickly pear are modified into spines, which lowers the surface-to-volume ratio and reduces water\nloss. Photosynthesis takes place in the stem, which also stores water. (b) A. perottetii leaves have a waxy cuticle\nthat prevents water loss. (c) Goldenrod (Solidago sp.) is a mesophyte, well suited for moderate environments. (d)\nHydrophytes, like this fragrant water lily (Nymphaea odorata), are adapted to thrive in aquatic environments.

These adaptations impede air flow\nacross the stomatal pore and reduce transpiration. Multiple epidermal layers are also commonly found in these types of\nplants.\nTransportation of Photosynthates in the Phloem\nPlants need an energy source to grow. In seeds and bulbs, food is stored in polymers (such as starch) that are converted by\nmetabolic processes into sucrose for newly developing plants. Once green shoots and leaves are growing, plants are able to\nproduce their own food by photosynthesizing. The products of photosynthesis are called photosynthates, which are usually\nin the form of simple sugars such as sucrose.\nStructures that produce photosynthates for the growing plant are referred to as sources. Sugars produced in sources, such\nas leaves, need to be delivered to growing parts of the plant via the phloem in a process called translocation. The points of\nsugar delivery, such as roots, young shoots, and developing seeds, are called sinks. Seeds, tubers, and bulbs can be either a\nsource or a sink, depending on the plant\u2019s stage of development and the season.\nThe products from the source are usually translocated to the nearest sink through the phloem. For example, the highest\nleaves will send photosynthates upward to the growing shoot tip, whereas lower leaves will direct photosynthates downward\nto the roots. Intermediate leaves will send products in both directions, unlike the flow in the xylem, which is always\nunidirectional (soil to leaf to atmosphere). The pattern of photosynthate flow changes as the plant grows and develops.\nPhotosynthates are directed primarily to the roots early on, to shoots and leaves during vegetative growth, and to seeds and\nfruits during reproductive development. They are also directed to tubers for storage.\nTranslocation: Transport from Source to Sink\nPhotosynthates, such as sucrose, are produced in the mesophyll cells of photosynthesizing leaves. From there they are\ntranslocated through the phloem to where they are used or stored. Mesophyll cells are connected by cytoplasmic channels\ncalled plasmodesmata. Photosynthates move through these channels to reach phloem sieve-tube elements (STEs) in the\nvascular bundles. From the mesophyll cells, the photosynthates are loaded into the phloem STEs. The sucrose is actively\ntransported against its concentration gradient (a process requiring ATP) into the phloem cells using the electrochemical\npotential of the proton gradient. This is coupled to the uptake of sucrose with a carrier protein called the sucrose-H+\nsymporter.\nPhloem STEs have reduced cytoplasmic contents, and are connected by a sieve plate with pores that allow for pressure-\ndriven bulk flow, or translocation, of phloem sap. Companion cells are associated with STEs. They assist with metabolic\nactivities and produce energy for the STEs (Figure 23.36).\nFigure 23.36 Phloem is comprised of cells called sieve-tube elements. Phloem sap travels through perforations called\nsieve tube plates. Neighboring companion cells carry out metabolic functions for the sieve-tube elements and provide\nthem with energy. Lateral sieve areas connect the sieve-tube elements to the companion cells.\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\n977\nOnce in the phloem, the photosynthates are translocated to the closest sink. Phloem sap is an aqueous solution that contains\nup to 30 percent sugar, minerals, amino acids, and plant growth regulators. The high percentage of sugar decreases \u03a8s,\nwhich decreases the total water potential and causes water to move by osmosis from the adjacent xylem into the phloem\ntubes, thereby increasing pressure. This increase in total water potential causes the bulk flow of phloem from source to\nsink (Figure 23.37). Sucrose concentration in the sink cells is lower than in the phloem STEs because the sink sucrose has\nbeen metabolized for growth, or converted to starch for storage or other polymers, such as cellulose, for structural integrity.\nUnloading at the sink end of the phloem tube occurs by either diffusion or active transport of sucrose molecules from an\narea of high concentration to one of low concentration. Water diffuses from the phloem by osmosis and is then transpired or\nrecycled via the xylem back into the phloem sap.\nFigure 23.37 Sucrose is actively transported from source cells into companion cells and then into the sieve-tube\nelements. This reduces the water potential, which causes water to enter the phloem from the xylem. The resulting\npositive pressure forces the sucrose-water mixture down toward the roots, where sucrose is unloaded. Transpiration\ncauses water to return to the leaves through the xylem vessels.\nActivity\nBased on water\u2019s molecular properties, create a visual diagram/model to illustrate how water travels up a\n300-foot California redwood tree through xylem.\nLab Investigation\nAP\u00ae Biology Investigative Labs: Inquiry-Based, Investigation 11: Transpiration.

        "summary": "The transport of water and solutes in plants relies on the coordinated functions of the xylem and phloem, driven by principles of water potential, which is influenced by solute concentration, pressure, gravity, and matric forces. Water moves from areas of higher to lower water potential, enabling processes like transpiration, where water evaporates from leaves, creating tension that pulls water upward through xylem vessels via the cohesion\u2013tension mechanism. Plants regulate water loss mainly through stomatal control, balancing the need for CO\u2082 intake for photosynthesis with the risk of dehydration, and have evolved adaptations such as thick cuticles, trichomes, and sunken stomata to reduce transpiration in challenging environments. In contrast, the phloem transports photosynthates (mainly sucrose) from sources (e.g., leaves) to sinks (e.g., roots, shoots, or fruits) through a process called translocation, which depends on active loading of sucrose into sieve-tube elements, osmotic water movement from the xylem, and resulting positive pressure that drives bulk flow toward sinks, where sugars are unloaded for metabolism, storage, or structural use."

exam. These questions address the following standards:\n[APLO 2.29][APLO 2.30]\nAnimals can respond to environmental factors by moving to a new location. Plants, however, are rooted in place and\nmust respond to the surrounding environmental factors. Plants have sophisticated systems to detect and respond to light,\ngravity, temperature, and physical touch. Receptors sense environmental factors and relay the information to effector\nsystems\u2014often through intermediate chemical messengers\u2014to bring about plant responses.\nPlant Responses to Light\nPlants have a number of sophisticated uses for light that go far beyond their ability to photosynthesize low-molecular-\nweight sugars using only carbon dioxide, light, and water. Photomorphogenesis is the growth and development of plants in\nresponse to light. It allows plants to optimize their use of light and space. Photoperiodism is the ability to use light to track\ntime. Plants can tell the time of day and time of year by sensing and using various wavelengths of sunlight. Phototropism\nis a directional response that allows plants to grow towards, or even away from, light.\nThe sensing of light in the environment is important to plants; it can be crucial for competition and survival. The response\nof plants to light is mediated by different photoreceptors, which are comprised of a protein covalently bonded to a light-\nabsorbing pigment called a chromophore. Together, the two are called a chromoprotein.\nThe red/far-red and violet-blue regions of the visible light spectrum trigger structural development in plants. Sensory\nphotoreceptors absorb light in these particular regions of the visible light spectrum because of the quality of light available\nin the daylight spectrum. In terrestrial habitats, light absorption by chlorophylls peaks in the blue and red regions of the\nspectrum. As light filters through the canopy and the blue and red wavelengths are absorbed, the spectrum shifts to the far-\nred end, shifting the plant community to those plants better adapted to respond to far-red light. Blue-light receptors allow\nplants to gauge the direction and abundance of sunlight, which is rich in blue\u2013green emissions. Water absorbs red light,\nwhich makes the detection of blue light essential for algae and aquatic plants.\nThe Phytochrome System and the Red/Far-Red Response\nThe phytochromes are a family of chromoproteins with a linear tetrapyrrole chromophore, similar to the ringed tetrapyrrole\nlight-absorbing head group of chlorophyll. Phytochromes have two photo-interconvertible forms: Pr and Pfr. Pr absorbs red\nlight (~667 nm) and is immediately converted to Pfr. Pfr absorbs far-red light (~730 nm) and is quickly converted back to\nPr. Absorption of red or far-red light causes a massive change to the shape of the chromophore, altering the conformation\nand activity of the phytochrome protein to which it is bound. Pfr is the physiologically active form of the protein; therefore,\nexposure to red light yields physiological activity. Exposure to far-red light inhibits phytochrome activity. Together, the two\nforms represent the phytochrome system (Figure 23.38).\nThe phytochrome system acts as a biological light switch. It monitors the level, intensity, duration, and color of\nenvironmental light. The effect of red light is reversible by immediately shining far-red light on the sample, which converts\nthe chromoprotein to the inactive Pr form. Additionally, Pfr can slowly revert to Pr in the dark, or break down over time. In\nall instances, the physiological response induced by red light is reversed. The active form of phytochrome (Pfr) can directly\nactivate other molecules in the cytoplasm, or it can be trafficked to the nucleus, where it directly activates or represses\nspecific gene expression.\nOnce the phytochrome system evolved, plants adapted it to serve a variety of needs. Unfiltered, full sunlight contains much\nmore red light than far-red light. Because chlorophyll absorbs strongly in the red region of the visible spectrum, but not in\nthe far-red region, any plant in the shade of another plant on the forest floor will be exposed to red-depleted, far-red-enriched\nlight. The preponderance of far-red light converts phytochrome in the shaded leaves to the Pr (inactive) form, slowing\ngrowth. The nearest non-shaded (or even less-shaded) areas on the forest floor have more red light; leaves exposed to these\nareas sense the red light, which activates the Pfr form and induces growth. In short, plant shoots use the phytochrome system\nto grow away from shade and towards light. Because competition for light is so fierce in a dense plant community, the\nevolutionary advantages of the phytochrome system are obvious.\nIn seeds, the phytochrome system is not used to determine direction and quality of light (shaded versus unshaded). Instead,\nis it used merely to determine if there is any light at all. This is especially important in species with very small seeds, such\nas lettuce. Because of their size, lettuce seeds have few food reserves. Their seedlings cannot grow for long before they run\nout of fuel. If they germinated even a centimeter under the soil surface, the seedling would never make it into the sunlight\nand would die. In the dark, phytochrome is in the Pr (inactive form) and the seed will not germinate; it will only germinate\nif exposed to light at the surface of the soil. Upon exposure to light, Pr is converted to Pfr and germination proceeds.\n982\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 23.38 The biologically inactive form of phytochrome (Pr) is converted to the biologically active form Pfr under\nillumination with red light. Far-red light and darkness convert the molecule back to the inactive form.\nPlants also use the phytochrome system to sense the change of season. Photoperiodism is a biological response to the timing\nand duration of day and night. It controls flowering, setting of winter buds, and vegetative growth. Detection of seasonal\nchanges is crucial to plant survival. Although temperature and light intensity influence plant growth, they are not reliable\nindicators of season because they may vary from one year to the next. Day length is a better indicator of the time of year.\nAs stated above, unfiltered sunlight is rich in red light but deficient in far-red light. Therefore, at dawn, all the phytochrome\nmolecules in a leaf quickly convert to the active Pfr form, and remain in that form until sunset. In the dark, the Pfr form\ntakes hours to slowly revert back to the Pr form. If the night is long (as in winter), all of the Pfr form reverts. If the night\nis short (as in summer), a considerable amount of Pfr may remain at sunrise. By sensing the Pr/Pfr ratio at dawn, a plant\ncan determine the length of the day/night cycle. In addition, leaves retain that information for several days, allowing a\ncomparison between the length of the previous night and the preceding several nights. Shorter nights indicate springtime\nto the plant; when the nights become longer, autumn is approaching. This information, along with sensing temperature and\nwater availability, allows plants to determine the time of the year and adjust their physiology accordingly. Short-day (long-\nnight) plants use this information to flower in the late summer and early fall, when nights exceed a critical length (often\neight or fewer hours). Long-day (short-night) plants flower during the spring, when darkness is less than a critical length\n(often eight to 15 hours). Not all plants use the phytochrome system in this way. Flowering in day-neutral plants is not\nregulated by daylength.\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\n983\nHorticulturist\nThe word \u201chorticulturist\u201d comes from the Latin words for garden (hortus) and culture (cultura). This career\nhas been revolutionized by progress made in the understanding of plant responses to environmental stimuli.\nGrowers of crops, fruit, vegetables, and flowers were previously constrained by having to time their sowing\nand harvesting according to the season. Now, horticulturists can manipulate plants to increase leaf, flower,\nor fruit production by understanding how environmental factors affect plant growth and development.\nGreenhouse management is an essential component of a horticulturist\u2019s education. To lengthen the night,\nplants are covered with a blackout shade cloth. Long-day plants are irradiated with red light in winter to\npromote early flowering. For example, fluorescent (cool white) light high in blue wavelengths encourages\nleafy growth and is excellent for starting seedlings. Incandescent lamps (standard light bulbs) are rich in\nred light, and promote flowering in some plants. The timing of fruit ripening can be increased or delayed\nby applying plant hormones. Recently, considerable progress has been made in the development of plant\nbreeds that are suited to different climates and resistant to pests and transportation damage. Both crop\nyield and quality have increased as a result of practical applications of the knowledge of plant responses to\nexternal stimuli and hormones.\nHorticulturists find employment in private and governmental laboratories, greenhouses, botanical gardens,\nand in the production or research fields. They improve crops by applying their knowledge of genetics and\nplant physiology. To prepare for a horticulture career, students take classes in botany, plant physiology, plant\npathology, landscape design, and plant breeding. To complement these traditional courses, horticulture\nmajors add studies in economics, business, computer science, and communications.\nThe Blue Light Responses\nPhototropism\u2014the directional bending of a plant toward or away from a light source\u2014is a response to blue wavelengths\nof light. Positive phototropism is growth towards a light source (Figure 23.39), while negative phototropism (also called\nskototropism) is growth away from light.\nThe aptly-named phototropins are protein-based receptors responsible for mediating the phototropic response. Like all\nplant photoreceptors, phototropins consist of a protein portion and a light-absorbing portion, called the chromophore. In\nphototropins, the chromophore is a covalently-bound molecule of flavin; hence, phototropins belong to a class of proteins\ncalled flavoproteins.\nOther responses under the control of phototropins are leaf opening and closing, chloroplast movement, and the opening of\nstomata. However, of all responses controlled by phototropins, phototropism has been studied the longest and is the best\nunderstood.\nIn their 1880 treatise The Power of Movements in Plants, Charles Darwin and his son Francis first described phototropism as\nthe bending of seedlings toward light. Darwin observed that light was perceived by the tip of the plant (the apical meristem),\nbut that the response (bending) took place in a different part of the plant. They concluded that the signal had to travel from\nthe apical meristem to the base of the plant.\n984\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 23.39 Azure bluets (Houstonia caerulea) display a phototropic response by bending toward the light. (credit:\nCory Zanker)\nIn 1913, Peter Boysen-Jensen demonstrated that a chemical signal produced in the plant tip was responsible for the bending\nat the base. He cut off the tip of a seedling, covered the cut section with a layer of gelatin, and then replaced the tip. The\nseedling bent toward the light when illuminated. However, when impermeable mica flakes were inserted between the tip and\nthe cut base, the seedling did not bend. A refinement of the experiment showed that the signal traveled on the shaded side\nof the seedling. When the mica plate was inserted on the illuminated side, the plant did bend towards the light. Therefore,\nthe chemical signal was a growth stimulant because the phototropic response involved faster cell elongation on the shaded\nside than on the illuminated side. We now know that as light passes through a plant stem, it is diffracted and generates\nphototropin activation across the stem. Most activation occurs on the lit side, causing the plant hormone indole acetic acid\n(IAA) to accumulate on the shaded side. Stem cells elongate under influence of IAA.\nCryptochromes are another class of blue-light absorbing photoreceptors that also contain a flavin-based chromophore.\nCryptochromes set the plants 24-hour activity cycle, also know as its circadian rhythem, using blue light cues. There is some\nevidence that cryptochromes work together with phototropins to mediate the phototropic response.\nUse the navigation menu in the left panel of this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/plnts_n_motion) to view images\nof plants in motion.\nIf green light was used rather than white light to irradiate a sunflower seedling, what would happen?\na.\nGreen light is absorbed by the plant.

The seedling would not grow tall and spindly, but it would bend.\nd.\nGreen light is absorbed by the plant. The seedling would not grow tall and spindly, but it would bend.\nPlant Responses to Gravity\nWhether or not they germinate in the light or in total darkness, shoots usually sprout up from the ground, and roots\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\n985\ngrow downward into the ground. A plant laid on its side in the dark will send shoots upward when given enough time.\nGravitropism ensures that roots grow into the soil and that shoots grow toward sunlight. Growth of the shoot apical tip\nupward is called negative gravitropism, whereas growth of the roots downward is called positive gravitropism.\nAmyloplasts (also known as statoliths) are specialized plastids that contain starch granules and settle downward in\nresponse to gravity. Amyloplasts are found in shoots and in specialized cells of the root cap. When a plant is tilted, the\nstatoliths drop to the new bottom cell wall. A few hours later, the shoot or root will show growth in the new vertical\ndirection.\nThe mechanism that mediates gravitropism is reasonably well understood. When amyloplasts settle to the bottom of the\ngravity-sensing cells in the root or shoot, they physically contact the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), causing the release of\ncalcium ions from inside the ER. This calcium signaling in the cells causes polar transport of the plant hormone IAA to\nthe bottom of the cell. In roots, a high concentration of IAA inhibits cell elongation. The effect slows growth on the lower\nside of the root, while cells develop normally on the upper side. IAA has the opposite effect in shoots, where a higher\nconcentration at the lower side of the shoot stimulates cell expansion, causing the shoot to grow up. After the shoot or root\nbegin to grow vertically, the amyloplasts return to their normal position. Other hypotheses\u2014involving the entire cell in\nthe gravitropism effect\u2014have been proposed to explain why some mutants that lack amyloplasts may still exhibit a weak\ngravitropic response.\nGrowth Responses\nA plant\u2019s sensory response to external stimuli relies on chemical messengers (hormones). Plant hormones affect all aspects\nof plant life, from flowering to fruit setting and maturation, and from phototropism to leaf fall. Potentially every cell in a\nplant can produce plant hormones. They can act in their cell of origin or be transported to other portions of the plant body,\nwith many plant responses involving the synergistic or antagonistic interaction of two or more hormones. In contrast, animal\nhormones are produced in specific glands and transported to a distant site for action, and they act alone.\nPlant hormones are a group of unrelated chemical substances that affect plant morphogenesis. Five major plant hormones\nare traditionally described: auxins (particularly IAA), cytokinins, gibberellins, ethylene, and abscisic acid. In addition, other\nnutrients and environmental conditions can be characterized as growth factors.\nAuxins\nThe term auxin is derived from the Greek word auxein, which means \"to grow.\" Auxins are the main hormones responsible\nfor cell elongation in phototropism and gravitropism. They also control the differentiation of meristem into vascular tissue,\nand promote leaf development and arrangement. While many synthetic auxins are used as herbicides, IAA is the only\nnaturally occurring auxin that shows physiological activity. Apical dominance\u2014the inhibition of lateral bud formation\u2014is\ntriggered by auxins produced in the apical meristem. Flowering, fruit setting and ripening, and inhibition of abscission (leaf\nfalling) are other plant responses under the direct or indirect control of auxins. Auxins also act as a relay for the effects of\nthe blue light and red/far-red responses.\nCommercial use of auxins is widespread in plant nurseries and for crop production. IAA is used as a rooting hormone\nto promote growth of adventitious roots on cuttings and detached leaves. Applying synthetic auxins to tomato plants in\ngreenhouses promotes normal fruit development. Outdoor application of auxin promotes synchronization of fruit setting\nand dropping to coordinate the harvesting season. Fruits such as seedless cucumbers can be induced to set fruit by treating\nunfertilized plant flowers with auxins.\nCytokinins\nThe effect of cytokinins was first reported when it was found that adding the liquid endosperm of coconuts to developing\nplant embryos in culture stimulated their growth. The stimulating growth factor was found to be cytokinin, a hormone that\npromotes cytokinesis (cell division). Almost 200 naturally occurring or synthetic cytokinins are known to date. Cytokinins\nare most abundant in growing tissues, such as roots, embryos, and fruits, where cell division is occurring. Cytokinins are\nknown to delay senescence in leaf tissues, promote mitosis, and stimulate differentiation of the meristem in shoots and\nroots. Many effects on plant development are under the influence of cytokinins, either in conjunction with auxin or another\nhormone. For example, apical dominance seems to result from a balance between auxins that inhibit lateral buds, and\ncytokinins that promote bushier growth.\nGibberellins\nGibberellins (GAs) are a group of about 125 closely related plant hormones that stimulate shoot elongation, seed\ngermination, and fruit and flower maturation. GAs are synthesized in the root and stem apical meristems, young leaves,\nand seed embryos. In urban areas, GA antagonists are sometimes applied to trees under power lines to control growth and\nreduce the frequency of pruning.\nGAs break dormancy (a state of inhibited growth and development) in the seeds of plants that require exposure to cold or\n986\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nlight to germinate. Other effects of GAs include gender expression, seedless fruit development, and the delay of senescence\nin leaves and fruit. Seedless grapes are obtained through standard breeding methods and contain inconspicuous seeds that\nfail to develop. Because GAs are produced by the seeds, and because fruit development and stem elongation are under GA\ncontrol, these varieties of grapes would normally produce small fruit in compact clusters. Maturing grapes are routinely\ntreated with GA to promote larger fruit size, as well as looser bunches (longer stems), which reduces the instance of mildew\ninfection (Figure 23.40).\nFigure 23.40 In grapes, application of gibberellic acid increases the size of fruit and loosens clustering. (credit: Bob\nNichols, USDA)\nAbscisic Acid\nThe plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) was first discovered as the agent that causes the abscission or dropping of cotton\nbolls. However, more recent studies indicate that ABA plays only a minor role in the abscission process. ABA accumulates\nas a response to stressful environmental conditions, such as dehydration, cold temperatures, or shortened day lengths. Its\nactivity counters many of the growth-promoting effects of GAs and auxins. ABA inhibits stem elongation and induces\ndormancy in lateral buds.\nABA induces dormancy in seeds by blocking germination and promoting the synthesis of storage proteins. Plants adapted\nto temperate climates require a long period of cold temperature before seeds germinate. This mechanism protects young\nplants from sprouting too early during unseasonably warm weather in winter. As the hormone gradually breaks down over\nwinter, the seed is released from dormancy and germinates when conditions are favorable in spring. Another effect of ABA\nis to promote the development of winter buds; it mediates the conversion of the apical meristem into a dormant bud. Low\nsoil moisture causes an increase in ABA, which causes stomata to close, reducing water loss in winter buds.\nEthylene\nEthylene is associated with fruit ripening, flower wilting, and leaf fall. Ethylene is unusual because it is a volatile gas\n(C2H4). Hundreds of years ago, when gas street lamps were installed in city streets, trees that grew close to lamp posts\ndeveloped twisted, thickened trunks and shed their leaves earlier than expected. These effects were caused by ethylene\nvolatilizing from the lamps.\nAging tissues (especially senescing leaves) and nodes of stems produce ethylene. The best-known effect of the hormone,\nhowever, is the promotion of fruit ripening. Ethylene stimulates the conversion of starch and acids to sugars. Some people\nstore unripe fruit, such as avocadoes, in a sealed paper bag to accelerate ripening; the gas released by the first fruit to\nmature will speed up the maturation of the remaining fruit. Ethylene also triggers leaf and fruit abscission, flower fading\nand dropping, and promotes germination in some cereals and sprouting of bulbs and potatoes.\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\n987\nEthylene is widely used in agriculture. Commercial fruit growers control the timing of fruit ripening with application of\nthe gas. Horticulturalists inhibit leaf dropping in ornamental plants by removing ethylene from greenhouses using fans and\nventilation.\nNontraditional Hormones\nRecent research has discovered a number of compounds that also influence plant development. Their roles are less\nunderstood than the effects of the major hormones described so far.\nJasmonates play a major role in defense responses to herbivory. Their levels increase when a plant is wounded by a\npredator, resulting in an increase in toxic secondary metabolites. They contribute to the production of volatile compounds\nthat attract natural enemies of predators. For example, chewing of tomato plants by caterpillars leads to an increase in\njasmonic acid levels, which in turn triggers the release of volatile compounds that attract predators of the pest.\nOligosaccharins also play a role in plant defense against bacterial and fungal infections. They act locally at the site of\ninjury, and can also be transported to other tissues. Strigolactones promote seed germination in some species and inhibit\nlateral apical development in the absence of auxins. Strigolactones also play a role in the establishment of mycorrhizae, a\nmutualistic association of plant roots and fungi. Brassinosteroids are important to many developmental and physiological\nprocesses. Signals between these compounds and other hormones, notably auxin and GAs, amplifies their physiological\neffect. Apical dominance, seed germination, gravitropism, and resistance to freezing are all positively influenced by\nhormones. Root growth and fruit dropping are inhibited by steroids.\nPlant Responses to Wind and Touch\nThe shoot of a pea plant winds around a trellis, while a tree grows on an angle in response to strong prevailing winds. These\nare examples of how plants respond to touch or wind.\nThe movement of a plant subjected to constant directional pressure is called thigmotropism, from the Greek words thigma\nmeaning \u201ctouch,\u201d and tropism implying \u201cdirection.\u201d Tendrils are one example of this. The meristematic region of tendrils\nis very touch sensitive; light touch will evoke a quick coiling response. Cells in contact with a support surface contract,\nwhereas cells on the opposite side of the support expand (Figure 23.14). Application of jasmonic acid is sufficient to trigger\ntendril coiling without a mechanical stimulus.\nA thigmonastic response is a touch response independent of the direction of stimulus Figure 23.24. In the Venus flytrap,\ntwo modified leaves are joined at a hinge and lined with thin fork-like tines along the outer edges. Tiny hairs are located\ninside the trap. When an insect brushes against these trigger hairs, touching two or more of them in succession, the leaves\nclose quickly, trapping the prey. Glands on the leaf surface secrete enzymes that slowly digest the insect. The released\nnutrients are absorbed by the leaves, which reopen for the next meal.\nThe mimosa plant is also known as the sensitive plant, because its leaves are sensitive to touch and will\nfold inward and droop. Leaves in their normal state are shown on the left.\nFigure 23.41\nThigmomorphogenesis is a slow developmental change in the shape of a plant subjected to continuous mechanical stress.\nWhen trees bend in the wind, for example, growth is usually stunted and the trunk thickens. Strengthening tissue, especially\nxylem, is produced to add stiffness to resist the wind\u2019s force. Researchers hypothesize that mechanical strain induces growth\nand differentiation to strengthen the tissues. Ethylene and jasmonate are likely involved in thigmomorphogenesis.\n988\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nUse the menu at the left to navigate to three short movies: (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/nastic_mvmt) a Venus fly trap\ncapturing prey, the progressive closing of sensitive plant leaflets, and the twining of tendrils.\nA Venus fly trap response is triggered by touching the leaves __.\na.\nanywhere, because the whole surface of the leaf responds to touch\nb.\nonly on the margins of the leaves where insects usually land\nc.\nin the center of the leaf, where the touch-sensitive hairs are located\nd.\non the petiole followed by the center of leaf which signal the presence of a wandering insect\nDefense Responses against Herbivores and Pathogens\nPlants face two types of enemies: herbivores and pathogens. Herbivores both large and small use plants as food, and actively\nchew them. Pathogens are agents of disease. These infectious microorganisms, such as fungi, bacteria, and nematodes, live\noff of the plant and damage its tissues. Plants have developed a variety of strategies to discourage or kill attackers.\nThe first line of defense in plants is an intact and impenetrable barrier. Bark and the waxy cuticle can protect against\npredators. Other adaptations against herbivory include thorns, which are modified branches, and spines, which are modified\nleaves. They discourage animals by causing physical damage and inducing rashes and allergic reactions. A plant\u2019s exterior\nprotection can be compromised by mechanical damage, which may provide an entry point for pathogens. If the first line of\ndefense is breached, the plant must resort to a different set of defense mechanisms, such as toxins and enzymes.\nSecondary metabolites are compounds that are not directly derived from photosynthesis and are not necessary for respiration\nor plant growth and development. Many metabolites are toxic, and can even be lethal to animals that ingest them. Some\nmetabolites are alkaloids, which discourage predators with noxious odors (such as the volatile oils of mint and sage) or\nrepellent tastes (like the bitterness of quinine). Other alkaloids affect herbivores by causing either excessive stimulation\n(caffeine is one example) or the lethargy associated with opioids. Some compounds become toxic after ingestion; for\ninstance, glycol cyanide in the cassava root releases cyanide only upon ingestion by the herbivore.\nMechanical wounding and predator attacks activate defense and protection mechanisms both in the damaged tissue and at\nsites farther from the injury location. Some defense reactions occur within minutes: others over several hours. The infected\nand surrounding cells may die, thereby stopping the spread of infection.\nLong-distance signaling elicits a systemic response aimed at deterring the predator. As tissue is damaged, jasmonates may\npromote the synthesis of compounds that are toxic to predators. Jasmonates also elicit the synthesis of volatile compounds\nthat attract parasitoids, which are insects that spend their developing stages in or on another insect, and eventually kill their\nhost. The plant may activate abscission of injured tissue if it is damaged beyond repair.\nChapter 23 | Plant Form and Physiology\n989\nThink About It\n1.\nOwners and managers of plant nurseries have to plan a lighting schedule for a long-day plant that will flower\nin February.

        "summary": "Plants have sophisticated sensory systems that detect and respond to environmental cues such as light, gravity, touch, chemical signals, and attacks by herbivores or pathogens. Light responses involve photoreceptors like phytochromes (red/far-red light), phototropins, and cryptochromes (blue light), influencing processes such as photomorphogenesis, photoperiodism, and phototropism. Gravitropism uses starch-filled amyloplasts to sense orientation, directing shoots upward and roots downward via redistribution of the hormone auxin (IAA). Plant hormones\u2014including auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, ethylene, and others like jasmonates and brassinosteroids\u2014regulate growth, development, dormancy, ripening, and defense. Plants also exhibit thigmotropism (directional growth in response to touch), thigmonasty (touch responses independent of stimulus direction), and thigmomorphogenesis (structural changes due to mechanical stress). Defense strategies range from physical barriers (bark, cuticle, thorns) to chemical deterrents (toxic secondary metabolites, volatile compounds that attract predators of herbivores) and systemic responses mediated by signaling molecules like jasmonates, which can activate protective compounds or trigger tissue abscission."

Homeostasis\nallows an animal to maintain a balance between its internal and external environments.\nThe arctic fox is an example of a complex animal that is well adapted to its environment and illustrates the relationships\nbetween an animal\u2019s form and function. According to researchers, animals living millions of years ago in the Himalayan\nMountains of Tibet are ancestors to many of today\u2019s cold-adapted animals. For example, a type of Tibetan fox from 3\u20135\nmillion years ago is the ancestor to the arctic fox.\n[1] More about this research can be found at the Science Daily website\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32arcticfox) .\n1. Xiaoming Wang, Zhijie Jack Tseng, Qiang Li, Gary T. Takeuchi, Guangpu Xie, From \u2018third pole\u2019 to north pole: a Himalayan origin for the arctic fox.\nProceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. June 11, 2014.\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\n1017\n24.1 | Animal Form and Function\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the various types of body plans that occur in animals?\n\u2022\nWhat are the limits on animal size and shape?\n\u2022\nHow do bioenergetics relate to body size, levels of activity, and the environment?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nAs you have learned, specialized cells in the animal body are organized into tissues, organs, and organ systems, which\nefficiently localize functions, such as the digestion of food and the elimination of wastes. As we explore the information in\nthis section, our primary focus is homeostasis\u2014the ability to maintain dynamic equilibrium around a set point. Animals\nneed to maintain their \u201cnormal\u201d internal environments while also responding to external environmental changes.\nIn our study of biology thus far, we have seen numerous examples of structure-function relationships, and the design of the\nanimal body is no exception. Specialization in multicellular animals contributes to efficiency in cell processes. For example,\nanimals must be able to procure nutrients and eliminate wastes, and cells that line the small intestine allow for diffusion.\nFurthermore, the relationship between metabolic rate and body mass is typically an inverse one: The smaller the animal, the\nhigher its metabolism, with mice having a higher metabolic rate than, for example, elephants. Because mice have a greater\nsurface area-to-volume ratio for their mass than larger animals, they lose heat at a faster rate and, consequently, require\nmore energy to maintain constant body temperature.\nSpeaking of temperature, we learned that the body temperature of ectothermic animals varies according to environmental\ntemperatures. When snakes need to warm up, they bask in the sun; when they need to cool down, they go into the shade.\nOther animals, including mice, kangaroos and humans, are endothermic because they are able to maintain a fairly constant\ninternal body temperature despite environmental temperatures; for example, shivering generates heat, whereas sweating\nreturns our body temperature to its normal set point of 37\u25e6C. We will explore the control of these responses in more detail\nin the Homeostasis section.\nThe information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework. The AP\u00ae Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent\nfoundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP\u00ae exam\nquestions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven Science Practices.\nBig Idea 2\nBiological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to reproduce,\nand to maintain dynamic homeostasis.\nEnduring\nUnderstanding\n2.A\nGrowth, reproduction and maintenance of living systems require free energy and matter.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n2.A.1 All living systems require constant input of free energy.\nScience\nPractice\n6.2 The student can construct explanations of phenomena based on evidence produced\nthrough scientific practices.\nLearning\nObjective\n2.1 The student is able to explain how biological systems use free energy based on empirical\ndata that all organisms require constant energy input to maintain organization, to grow and to\nreproduce.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n2.A.1 All living systems require constant input of free energy.\nScience\nPractice\n6.1: The student can justify claims with evidence.\n1018\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nLearning\nObjective\n2.2 The student is able to justify a scientific claim that free energy is required for living\nsystems to maintain organization, to grow or to reproduce, but that multiple strategies exist in\ndifferent living systems.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n2.A.1 All living systems require constant input of free energy.\nScience\nPractice\n4.2 The student can design a plan for collecting data to answer a particular scientific\nquestion.\nLearning\nObjective\n2.35 The student is able to design a plan for collecting data to support the scientific claim\nthat timing and coordination of physiological events involve regulation\nEssential\nKnowledge\n2.A.1 All living systems require constant input of free energy.\nScience\nPractice\n6.1 The student can justify claims with evidence.\nLearning\nObjective\n2.36 The student is able to justify scientific claims with evidence to show how timing and\ncoordination of physiological events involve regulation.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n2.A.1 All living systems require constant input of free energy.\nScience\nPractice\n7.2 The student can connect concepts in and across domain(s) to generalize or extrapolate\nin and/or across enduring understandings and/or big ideas.\nLearning\nObjective\n2.37 The student is able to connect concepts that describe mechanisms that regulate the\ntiming and coordination of physiological events.\nAnimals vary in form and function. From a sponge to a worm to a goat, an organism has a distinct body plan that limits its\nsize and shape. Animals\u2019 bodies are also designed to interact with their environments, whether in the deep sea, a rainforest\ncanopy, or the desert. Therefore, a large amount of information about the structure of an organism's body (anatomy) and the\nfunction of its cells, tissues and organs (physiology) can be learned by studying that organism's environment.\nBody Plans\nFigure 24.2 Animals exhibit different types of body symmetry. The sponge is asymmetrical, the sea anemone has\nradial symmetry, and the goat has bilateral symmetry.\nAnimal body plans follow set patterns related to symmetry. They are asymmetrical, radial, or bilateral in form as illustrated\nin Figure 24.2. Asymmetrical animals are animals with no pattern or symmetry; an example of an asymmetrical animal is\na sponge. Radial symmetry, as illustrated in Figure 24.2, describes when an animal has an up-and-down orientation: any\nplane cut along its longitudinal axis through the organism produces equal halves, but not a definite right or left side. This\nplan is found mostly in aquatic animals, especially organisms that attach themselves to a base, like a rock or a boat, and\nextract their food from the surrounding water as it flows around the organism. Bilateral symmetry is illustrated in the same\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\n1019\nfigure by a goat. The goat also has an upper and lower component to it, but a plane cut from front to back separates the\nanimal into definite right and left sides. Additional terms used when describing positions in the body are anterior (front),\nposterior (rear), dorsal (toward the back), and ventral (toward the stomach). Bilateral symmetry is found in both land-based\nand aquatic animals; it enables a high level of mobility.\nLimits on Animal Size and Shape\nAnimals with bilateral symmetry that live in water tend to have a fusiform shape: this is a tubular shaped body that is\ntapered at both ends. This shape decreases the drag on the body as it moves through water and allows the animal to swim at\nhigh speeds. Table 24.1 lists the maximum speed of various animals. Certain types of sharks can swim at fifty kilometers\nan hour and some dolphins at 32 to 40 kilometers per hour. Land animals frequently travel faster, although the tortoise and\nsnail are significantly slower than cheetahs. Another difference in the adaptations of aquatic and land-dwelling organisms\nis that aquatic organisms are constrained in shape by the forces of drag in the water since water has higher viscosity than\nair. On the other hand, land-dwelling organisms are constrained mainly by gravity, and drag is relatively unimportant. For\nexample, most adaptations in birds are for gravity not for drag.\nMaximum Speed of Assorted Land Marine Animals\nAnimal\nSpeed (kmh)\nSpeed (mph)\nCheetah\n113\n70\nQuarter horse\n77\n48\nFox\n68\n42\nShortfin mako shark\n50\n31\nDomestic house cat\n48\n30\nHuman\n45\n28\nDolphin\n32\u201340\n20\u201325\nMouse\n13\n8\nSnail\n0.05\n0.03\nTable 24.1\nMost animals have an exoskeleton, including insects, spiders, scorpions, horseshoe crabs, centipedes, and crustaceans.\nScientists estimate that, of insects alone, there are over 30 million species on our planet. The exoskeleton is a hard covering\nor shell that provides benefits to the animal, such as protection against damage from predators and from water loss (for land\nanimals); it also provides for the attachments of muscles.\nAs the tough and resistant outer cover of an arthropod, the exoskeleton may be constructed of a tough polymer such as chitin\nand is often biomineralized with materials such as calcium carbonate. This is fused to the animal\u2019s epidermis. Ingrowths of\nthe exoskeleton, called apodemes, function as attachment sites for muscles, similar to tendons in more advanced animals\n(Figure 24.3). In order to grow, the animal must first synthesize a new exoskeleton underneath the old one and then shed\nor molt the original covering. This limits the animal\u2019s ability to grow continually, and may limit the individual\u2019s ability\nto mature if molting does not occur at the proper time. The thickness of the exoskeleton must be increased significantly\nto accommodate any increase in weight. It is estimated that a doubling of body size increases body weight by a factor of\neight. The increasing thickness of the chitin necessary to support this weight limits most animals with an exoskeleton to a\nrelatively small size. The same principles apply to endoskeletons, but they are more efficient because muscles are attached\non the outside, making it easier to compensate for increased mass.\n1020\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 24.3 Apodemes are ingrowths on arthropod exoskeletons to which muscles attach. The apodemes on this crab\nleg are located above and below the fulcrum of the claw. Contraction of muscles attached to the apodemes pulls the\nclaw closed.\nAn animal with an endoskeleton has its size determined by the amount of skeletal system it needs in order to support the\nother tissues and the amount of muscle it needs for movement. As the body size increases, both bone and muscle mass\nincrease. The speed achievable by the animal is a balance between its overall size and the bone and muscle that provide\nsupport and movement.\nLimiting Effects of Diffusion on Size and Development\nThe exchange of nutrients and wastes between a cell and its watery environment occurs through the process of diffusion. All\nliving cells are bathed in liquid, whether they are in a single-celled organism or a multicellular one. Diffusion is effective\nover a specific distance and limits the size that an individual cell can attain. If a cell is a single-celled microorganism, such\nas an amoeba, it can satisfy all of its nutrient and waste needs through diffusion. If the cell is too large, then diffusion is\nineffective and the center of the cell does not receive adequate nutrients nor is it able to effectively dispel its waste.\nAn important concept in understanding how efficient diffusion is as a means of transport is the surface area to volume ratio.\nRecall that any three-dimensional object has a surface area and volume; the ratio of these two quantities is the surface-\nto-volume ratio. Consider a cell shaped like a perfect sphere: it has a surface area of 4\u03c0r2, and a volume of (4/3)\u03c0r3. The\nsurface-to-volume ratio of a sphere is 3/r; as the cell gets bigger, its surface area to volume ratio decreases, making diffusion\nless efficient. The larger the size of the sphere, or animal, the less surface area for diffusion it possesses.\nThe solution to producing larger organisms is for them to become multicellular. Specialization occurs in complex organisms,\nallowing cells to become more efficient at doing fewer tasks. For example, circulatory systems bring nutrients and remove\nwaste, while respiratory systems provide oxygen for the cells and remove carbon dioxide from them. Other organ systems\nhave developed further specialization of cells and tissues and efficiently control body functions. Moreover, surface area-to-\nvolume ratio applies to other areas of animal development, such as the relationship between muscle mass and cross-sectional\nsurface area in supporting skeletons, and in the relationship between muscle mass and the generation of dissipation of heat.\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\n1021\nVisit this interactive site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/nanoscopy) to see an entire animal (a zebrafish embryo) at the\ncellular and sub-cellular level. Use the zoom and navigation functions for a virtual nanoscopy exploration.\nZebrafish have bilateral symmetry. What does that mean?\na.\nBilaterally symmetric means that a plane cut from the front to back of the organism produces distinct left and\nright sides that are mirror images of each other.\nb.\nBilaterally symmetric means that a plane cut from the top to the bottom of the organism produces distinct\nleft and right sides that are mirror images of each other.\nc.\nBilaterally symmetric means that a plane cut from the front to back of the organism produces distinct left and\nright sides that are not mirror images of each other.\nd.\nBilaterally symmetric means that a plane cut along its longitudinal axis produces equal halves, but not\ndefinite right or left sides.\nAnimal Bioenergetics\nAll animals must obtain their energy from food they ingest or absorb. These nutrients are converted to adenosine\ntriphosphate (ATP) for short-term storage and use by all cells. Some animals store energy for slightly longer times as\nglycogen, and others store energy for much longer times in the form of triglycerides housed in specialized adipose tissues.\nNo energy system is one hundred percent efficient, and an animal\u2019s metabolism produces waste energy in the form of heat.\nIf an animal can conserve that heat and maintain a relatively constant body temperature, it is classified as a warm-blooded\nanimal and called an endotherm. The insulation used to conserve the body heat comes in the forms of fur, fat, or feathers.\nThe absence of insulation in ectothermic animals increases their dependence on the environment for body heat.\nThe amount of energy expended by an animal over a specific time is called its metabolic rate. The rate is measured variously\nin joules, calories, or kilocalories (1000 calories). Carbohydrates and proteins contain about 4.5 to 5 kcal/g, and fat contains\nabout 9 kcal/g. Metabolic rate is estimated as the basal metabolic rate (BMR) in endothermic animals at rest and as the\nstandard metabolic rate (SMR) in ectotherms. Human males have a BMR of 1600 to 1800 kcal/day, and human females\nhave a BMR of 1300 to 1500 kcal/day. Even with insulation, endothermal animals require extensive amounts of energy to\nmaintain a constant body temperature. An ectotherm such as an alligator has an SMR of 60 kcal/day.\nEnergy Requirements Related to Body Size\nSmaller endothermic animals have a greater surface area for their mass than larger ones (Figure 24.4). Therefore, smaller\nanimals lose heat at a faster rate than larger animals and require more energy to maintain a constant internal temperature.\nThis results in a smaller endothermic animal having a higher BMR, per body weight, than a larger endothermic animal.\n1022\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 24.4 The mouse has a much higher metabolic rate than the elephant. (credit \u201cmouse\u201d: modification of work by\nMagnus Kjaergaard; credit \u201celephant\u201d: modification of work by \u201cTheLizardQueen\u201d/Flickr)\nEnergy Requirements Related to Levels of Activity\nThe more active an animal is, the more energy is needed to maintain that activity, and the higher its BMR or SMR. The\naverage daily rate of energy consumption is about two to four times an animal\u2019s BMR or SMR. Humans are more sedentary\nthan most animals and have an average daily rate of only 1.5 times the BMR. The diet of an endothermic animal is\ndetermined by its BMR. For example: the type of grasses, leaves, or shrubs that an herbivore eats affects the number of\ncalories that it takes in. The relative caloric content of herbivore foods, in descending order, is tall grasses > legumes > short\ngrasses > forbs (any broad-leaved plant, not a grass) > subshrubs > annuals/biennials.\nEnergy Requirements Related to Environment\nAnimals adapt to extremes of temperature or food availability through torpor. Torpor is a process that leads to a decrease in\nactivity and metabolism and allows animals to survive adverse conditions. Torpor can be used by animals for long periods,\nsuch as entering a state of hibernation during the winter months, in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body\ntemperature. During hibernation, ground squirrels can achieve an abdominal temperature of 0\u00b0 C (32\u00b0 F), while a bear\u2019s\ninternal temperature is maintained higher at about 37\u00b0 C (99\u00b0 F).\nIf torpor occurs during the summer months with high temperatures and little water, it is called estivation. Some desert\nanimals use this to survive the harshest months of the year. Torpor can occur on a daily basis; this is seen in bats and\nhummingbirds. While endothermy is limited in smaller animals by surface to volume ratio, some organisms can be smaller\nand still be endotherms because they employ daily torpor during the part of the day that is coldest. This allows them to\nconserve energy during the colder parts of the day, when they consume more energy to maintain their body temperature.\nActivity\nRead about how scientists developed a method using today\u2019s technology to collect data on heart rates\nin hibernating bears at this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32bears) . Design an experiment that\nwould allow you to collect body temperature and heart rate at the same time. Discuss how combining data\non body temperature with heart rate can give you information on the animal\u2019s overall metabolism.\nThink About It\n\u2022\nSmall mammals, such as squirrels need to eat at least once a week during hibernation. Why is it impossible for\nthem to go through the entire winter without eating, as bears do? Also, why must smaller mammals, like squirrels,\nstore food for the winter while larger mammals, like bears, do not?\n\u2022\nHummingbirds lower their metabolic rate and body temperature at night, an example of torpor. What advantage\ndoes torpor provide hummingbirds on a nightly basis? Think about the high metabolic rates of hummingbirds.\nAnimal Body Planes and Cavities\nA standing vertebrate animal can be divided by several planes. A sagittal plane divides the body into right and left portions.\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\n1023\nA midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in the middle, making two equal right and left halves. A frontal plane (also\ncalled a coronal plane) separates the belly (ventral) or stomach from the back (dorsal). A transverse plane (or, horizontal\nplane) is perpendicular to the sagittal planes and the long axis of the body. This is sometimes called a cross section, and, if\nthe transverse cut is at an angle, it is called an oblique plane. Figure 24.5 illustrates these planes on a goat (a four-legged\nanimal) and a human being.\nFigure 24.5 Shown are the planes of a quadruped goat and a bipedal human. The midsagittal plane divides the body\nexactly in half, into right and left portions. The frontal plane divides the front and back, and the transverse plane divides\nthe body into upper and lower portions.\nVertebrate animals have a number of defined body cavities, as illustrated in Figure 24.6. Two of these are major cavities\nthat contain smaller cavities within them. The dorsal cavity contains the cranial and the vertebral (or spinal) cavities. The\nventral cavity contains the thoracic cavity, which in turn contains the pleural cavity around the lungs and the pericardial\ncavity, which surrounds the heart. The ventral cavity also contains the abdominopelvic cavity, which can be separated into\nthe abdominal and the pelvic cavities.\n1024\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 24.6 Vertebrate animals have two major body cavities. The dorsal cavity, indicated in green, contains the cranial\nand the spinal cavity. The ventral cavity, indicated in yellow, contains the thoracic cavity and the abdominopelvic cavity.\nThe thoracic cavity is separated from the abdominopelvic cavity by the diaphragm. The thoracic cavity is separated\ninto the abdominal cavity and the pelvic cavity by an imaginary line parallel to the pelvis bones. (credit: modification of\nwork by NCI)\nPhysical Anthropologist\nPhysical anthropologists study the adaption, variability, and evolution of human beings, plus their living and\nfossil relatives. They can work in a variety of settings, although most will have an academic appointment at\na university, usually in an anthropology department or a biology, genetics, or zoology department.\nNon-academic positions are available in the automotive and aerospace industries where the focus is\non human size, shape, and anatomy. Research by these professionals might range from studies of\nhow the human body reacts to car crashes to exploring how to make seats more comfortable. Other\nnon-academic positions can be obtained in museums of natural history, anthropology, archaeology, or\nscience and technology. These positions involve educating students from grade school through graduate\nschool. Physical anthropologists serve as education coordinators, collection managers, writers for museum\npublications, and as administrators. Zoos employ these professionals, especially if they have an expertise\nin primate biology; they work in collection management and captive breeding programs for endangered\nspecies. Forensic science utilizes physical anthropology expertise in identifying human and animal remains,\nassisting in determining the cause of death, and for expert testimony in trials.\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\n1025\n24.2 | Animal Primary Tissues\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are characteristics of epithelial tissues?\n\u2022\nWhat are the different types of connective tissues in animals?\n\u2022\nWhat are differences among the three types of muscle tissue?\n\u2022\nWhat are characteristics of nervous tissue?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe content described in this section is not within the scope of AP\u00ae. However, we have already learned that the relationship\nbetween structure and function includes the cellular level, and we will continue to reinforce that when we explore the\nnervous system later.\nThe tissues of multicellular, complex animals are four primary types: epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous.

        "summary": "Animal form and function examines how the structures and physiological processes of animals are shaped by evolutionary adaptation to their environments, exploring body plans, size and shape limitations, bioenergetics, and anatomical organization. Body symmetry can be asymmetrical, radial, or bilateral, with bilateral symmetry enabling greater mobility. Size and shape are influenced by environmental factors such as drag in aquatic habitats or gravity on land, skeletal structure (exo- or endoskeleton), and diffusion limits, which favor multicellularity and specialized systems for transport and respiration. Bioenergetics covers how animals obtain, store, and use energy, with metabolic rates influenced by body size, activity level, and environmental conditions; smaller animals have higher mass-specific metabolic rates, and strategies like torpor, hibernation, and estivation help conserve energy. Anatomical orientation is described by body planes (sagittal, frontal, transverse) and cavities (dorsal and ventral, with subdivisions housing major organs), establishing a framework for understanding the relationship between an animal\u2019s physical structure and its environmental interactions."

        "text": "24.2 | Animal Primary Tissues\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are characteristics of epithelial tissues?\n\u2022\nWhat are the different types of connective tissues in animals?\n\u2022\nWhat are differences among the three types of muscle tissue?\n\u2022\nWhat are characteristics of nervous tissue?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe content described in this section is not within the scope of AP\u00ae. However, we have already learned that the relationship\nbetween structure and function includes the cellular level, and we will continue to reinforce that when we explore the\nnervous system later.\nThe tissues of multicellular, complex animals are four primary types: epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Recall\nthat tissues are groups of similar cells group of similar cells carrying out related functions. These tissues combine to form\norgans\u2014like the skin or kidney\u2014that have specific, specialized functions within the body. Organs are organized into organ\nsystems to perform functions; examples include the circulatory system, which consists of the heart and blood vessels, and\nthe digestive system, consisting of several organs, including the stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas. Organ systems\ncome together to create an entire organism.\nEpithelial Tissues\nEpithelial tissues cover the outside of organs and structures in the body and line the lumens of organs in a single layer\nor multiple layers of cells. The types of epithelia are classified by the shapes of cells present and the number of layers of\ncells. Epithelia composed of a single layer of cells is called simple epithelia; epithelial tissue composed of multiple layers\nis called stratified epithelia. Table 24.2 summarizes the different types of epithelial tissues.\nDifferent Types of Epithelial Tissues\nCell\nshape\nDescription\nLocation\nsquamous\nflat, irregular round shape\nsimple: lung alveoli, capillaries stratified: skin,\nmouth, vagina\ncuboidal\ncube shaped, central nucleus\nglands, renal tubules\ncolumnar\ntall, narrow, nucleus toward base tall, narrow,\nnucleus along cell\nsimple: digestive tract pseudostratified:\nrespiratory tract\ntransitional\nround, simple but appear stratified\nurinary bladder\nTable 24.2\nSquamous Epithelia\nSquamous epithelial cells are generally round, flat, and have a small, centrally located nucleus. The cell outline is slightly\nirregular, and cells fit together to form a covering or lining. When the cells are arranged in a single layer (simple epithelia),\nthey facilitate diffusion in tissues, such as the areas of gas exchange in the lungs and the exchange of nutrients and waste at\nblood capillaries.\n1026\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 24.7 Squamous epithelia cells (a) have a slightly irregular shape, and a small, centrally located nucleus. These\ncells can be stratified into layers, as in (b) this human cervix specimen. (credit b: modification of work by Ed Uthman;\nscale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nFigure 24.7a illustrates a layer of squamous cells with their membranes joined together to form an epithelium. Image\nFigure 24.7b illustrates squamous epithelial cells arranged in stratified layers, where protection is needed on the body from\noutside abrasion and damage. This is called a stratified squamous epithelium and occurs in the skin and in tissues lining the\nmouth and vagina.\nCuboidal Epithelia\nCuboidal epithelial cells, shown in Figure 24.8, are cube-shaped with a single, central nucleus. They are most commonly\nfound in a single layer representing a simple epithelia in glandular tissues throughout the body where they prepare and\nsecrete glandular material. They are also found in the walls of tubules and in the ducts of the kidney and liver.\nFigure 24.8 Simple cuboidal epithelial cells line tubules in the mammalian kidney, where they are involved in filtering\nthe blood.\nColumnar Epithelia\nColumnar epithelial cells are taller than they are wide: they resemble a stack of columns in an epithelial layer, and are\nmost commonly found in a single-layer arrangement. The nuclei of columnar epithelial cells in the digestive tract appear to\nbe lined up at the base of the cells, as illustrated in Figure 24.9. These cells absorb material from the lumen of the digestive\ntract and prepare it for entry into the body through the circulatory and lymphatic systems.\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\n1027\nFigure 24.9 Simple columnar epithelial cells absorb material from the digestive tract. Goblet cells secret mucous into\nthe digestive tract lumen.\nColumnar epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract appear to be stratified. However, each cell is attached to the base\nmembrane of the tissue and, therefore, they are simple tissues. The nuclei are arranged at different levels in the layer of cells,\nmaking it appear as though there is more than one layer, as seen in Figure 24.10. This is called pseudostratified, columnar\nepithelia. This cellular covering has cilia at the apical, or free, surface of the cells. The cilia enhance the movement of\nmucous and trapped particles out of the respiratory tract, helping to protect the system from invasive microorganisms and\nharmful material that has been breathed into the body. Goblet cells are interspersed in some tissues (such as the lining of\nthe trachea). The goblet cells contain mucous that traps irritants, which in the case of the trachea keep these irritants from\ngetting into the lungs.\nFigure 24.10 Pseudostratified columnar epithelia line the respiratory tract. They exist in one layer, but the arrangement\nof nuclei at different levels makes it appear that there is more than one layer. Goblet cells interspersed between the\ncolumnar epithelial cells secrete mucous into the respiratory tract.\nTransitional Epithelia\nTransitional or uroepithelial cells appear only in the urinary system, primarily in the bladder and ureter. These cells are\narranged in a stratified layer, but they have the capability of appearing to pile up on top of each other in a relaxed, empty\nbladder, as illustrated in Figure 24.11. As the urinary bladder fills, the epithelial layer unfolds and expands to hold the\nvolume of urine introduced into it. As the bladder fills, it expands and the lining becomes thinner. In other words, the tissue\ntransitions from thick to thin.\n1028\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 24.11 Transitional epithelia of the urinary bladder undergo changes in thickness depending on how full the\nbladder is.\nAn empty bladder is composed of piled up transitional cells with a folded epithelial lining. What would you predict\nhappens to those cells as the bladder fills with urine?\na.\nThe epithelial lining unfolds and becomes thicker.\nb.\nThe epithelial lining remains folded with the cells piled up.\nc.\nThe epithelial lining unfolds and becomes thinner.\nd.\nThe epithelial lining unfolds, but remains the same thickness.\nConnective Tissues\nConnective tissues are made up of a matrix consisting of living cells and a non-living substance, called the ground\nsubstance. The ground substance is made of an organic substance (usually a protein) and an inorganic substance (usually a\nmineral or water). The principal cell of connective tissues is the fibroblast. This cell makes the fibers found in nearly all of\nthe connective tissues. Fibroblasts are motile, able to carry out mitosis, and can synthesize whichever connective tissue is\nneeded. Macrophages, lymphocytes, and, occasionally, leukocytes can be found in some of the tissues. Some tissues have\nspecialized cells that are not found in the others. The matrix in connective tissues gives the tissue its density. When a\nconnective tissue has a high concentration of cells or fibers, it has proportionally a less dense matrix.\nThe organic portion or protein fibers found in connective tissues are either collagen, elastic, or reticular fibers. Collagen\nfibers provide strength to the tissue, preventing it from being torn or separated from the surrounding tissues. Elastic fibers\nare made of the protein elastin; this fiber can stretch to one and one half of its length and return to its original size and shape.\nElastic fibers provide flexibility to the tissues. Reticular fibers are the third type of protein fiber found in connective tissues.\nThis fiber consists of thin strands of collagen that form a network of fibers to support the tissue and other organs to which\nit is connected. The various types of connective tissues, the types of cells and fibers they are made of, and sample locations\nof the tissues is summarized in Table 24.3.\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\n1029\nConnective Tissues\nTissue\nCells\nFibers\nLocation\nloose/areolar\nfibroblasts, macrophages,\nsome lymphocytes, some\nneutrophils\nfew: collagen, elastic,\nreticular\naround blood vessels;\nanchors epithelia\ndense, fibrous\nconnective\ntissue\nfibroblasts, macrophages,\nmostly collagen\nirregular: skin regular:\ntendons, ligaments\ncartilage\nchondrocytes, chondroblasts\nhyaline: few collagen\nfibrocartilage: large amount\nof collagen\nshark skeleton, fetal bones,\nhuman ears, intervertebral\ndiscs\nbone\nosteoblasts, osteocytes,\nosteoclasts\nsome: collagen, elastic\nvertebrate skeletons\nadipose\nadipocytes\nfew\nadipose (fat)\nblood\nred blood cells, white blood\ncells\nnone\nblood\nTable 24.3\nLoose/Areolar Connective Tissue\nLoose connective tissue, also called areolar connective tissue, has a sampling of all of the components of a connective\ntissue. As illustrated in Figure 24.12, loose connective tissue has some fibroblasts; macrophages are present as well.\nCollagen fibers are relatively wide and stain a light pink, while elastic fibers are thin and stain dark blue to black. The space\nbetween the formed elements of the tissue is filled with the matrix. The material in the connective tissue gives it a loose\nconsistency similar to a cotton ball that has been pulled apart. Loose connective tissue is found around every blood vessel\nand helps to keep the vessel in place. The tissue is also found around and between most body organs. In summary, areolar\ntissue is tough, yet flexible, and comprises membranes.\nFigure 24.12 Loose connective tissue is composed of loosely woven collagen and elastic fibers. The fibers and other\ncomponents of the connective tissue matrix are secreted by fibroblasts.\nFibrous Connective Tissue\nFibrous connective tissues contain large amounts of collagen fibers and few cells or matrix material. The fibers can be\narranged irregularly or regularly with the strands lined up in parallel. Irregularly arranged fibrous connective tissues are\nfound in areas of the body where stress occurs from all directions, such as the dermis of the skin. Regular fibrous connective\ntissue, shown in Figure 24.13, is found in tendons (which connect muscles to bones) and ligaments (which connect bones\n1030\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nto bones).\nFigure 24.13 Fibrous connective tissue from the tendon has strands of collagen fibers lined up in parallel.\nCartilage\nCartilage is a connective tissue with a large amount of the matrix and variable amounts of fibers. The cells, called\nchondrocytes, make the matrix and fibers of the tissue. Chondrocytes are found in spaces within the tissue called lacunae.\nA cartilage with few collagen and elastic fibers is hyaline cartilage, illustrated in Figure 24.14. The lacunae are randomly\nscattered throughout the tissue and the matrix takes on a milky or scrubbed appearance with routine histological stains.\nSharks have cartilaginous skeletons, as does nearly the entire human skeleton during a specific pre-birth developmental\nstage. A remnant of this cartilage persists in the outer portion of the human nose. Hyaline cartilage is also found at the ends\nof long bones, reducing friction and cushioning the articulations of these bones.\nFigure 24.14 Hyaline cartilage consists of a matrix with cells called chondrocytes embedded in it. The chondrocytes\nexist in cavities in the matrix called lacunae.\nElastic cartilage has a large amount of elastic fibers, giving it tremendous flexibility. The ears of most vertebrate animals\ncontain this cartilage as do portions of the larynx, or voice box. Fibrocartilage contains a large amount of collagen fibers,\ngiving the tissue tremendous strength. Fibrocartilage comprises the intervertebral discs in vertebrate animals. Hyaline\ncartilage found in movable joints such as the knee and shoulder becomes damaged as a result of age or trauma. Damaged\nhyaline cartilage is replaced by fibrocartilage and results in the joints becoming \u201cstiff.\u201d\nBone\nBone, or osseous tissue, is a connective tissue that has a large amount of two different types of matrix material. The organic\nmatrix is similar to the matrix material found in other connective tissues, including some amount of collagen and elastic\nfibers. This gives strength and flexibility to the tissue. The inorganic matrix consists of mineral salts\u2014mostly calcium\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\n1031\nsalts\u2014that give the tissue hardness. Without adequate organic material in the matrix, the tissue breaks; without adequate\ninorganic material in the matrix, the tissue bends.\nThere are three types of cells in bone: osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts are active in making bone\nfor growth and remodeling. Osteoblasts deposit bone material into the matrix and, after the matrix surrounds them, they\ncontinue to live, but in a reduced metabolic state as osteocytes. Osteocytes are found in lacunae of the bone. Osteoclasts\nare active in breaking down bone for bone remodeling, and they provide access to calcium stored in tissues. Osteoclasts are\nusually found on the surface of the tissue.\nBone can be divided into two types: compact and spongy. Compact bone is found in the shaft (or diaphysis) of a long bone\nand the surface of the flat bones, while spongy bone is found in the end (or epiphysis) of a long bone. Compact bone is\norganized into subunits called osteons, as illustrated in Figure 24.15. A blood vessel and a nerve are found in the center\nof the structure within the Haversian canal, with radiating circles of lacunae around it known as lamellae. The wavy lines\nseen between the lacunae are microchannels called canaliculi; they connect the lacunae to aid diffusion between the cells.\nSpongy bone is made of tiny plates called trabeculae these plates serve as struts to give the spongy bone strength. Over\ntime, these plates can break causing the bone to become less resilient. Bone tissue forms the internal skeleton of vertebrate\nanimals, providing structure to the animal and points of attachment for tendons.\n1032\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 24.15 (a) Compact bone is a dense matrix on the outer surface of bone. Spongy bone, inside the compact\nbone, is porous with web-like trabeculae. (b) Compact bone is organized into rings called osteons. Blood vessels,\nnerves, and lymphatic vessels are found in the central Haversian canal. Rings of lamellae surround the Haversian\ncanal. Between the lamellae are cavities called lacunae. Canaliculi are microchannels connecting the lacunae together.\n(c) Osteoblasts surround the exterior of the bone. Osteoclasts bore tunnels into the bone and osteocytes are found in\nthe lacunae.\nAdipose Tissue\nAdipose tissue, or fat tissue, is considered a connective tissue even though it does not have fibroblasts or a real matrix\nand only has a few fibers. Adipose tissue is made up of cells called adipocytes that collect and store fat in the form of\ntriglycerides, for energy metabolism. Adipose tissues additionally serve as insulation to help maintain body temperatures,\nallowing animals to be endothermic, and they function as cushioning against damage to body organs. Under a microscope,\nadipose tissue cells appear empty due to the extraction of fat during the processing of the material for viewing, as seen in\nFigure 24.16. The thin lines in the image are the cell membranes, and the nuclei are the small, black dots at the edges of the\ncells.\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\n1033\nFigure 24.16 Adipose is a connective tissue is made up of cells called adipocytes. Adipocytes have small nuclei\nlocalized at the cell edge.\nBlood\nBlood is considered a connective tissue because it has a matrix, as shown in Figure 24.17. The living cell types are red\nblood cells (RBC), also called erythrocytes, and white blood cells (WBC), also called leukocytes. The fluid portion of whole\nblood, its matrix, is commonly called plasma.\nFigure 24.17 Blood is a connective tissue that has a fluid matrix, called plasma, and no fibers. Erythrocytes (red blood\ncells), the predominant cell type, are involved in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Also present are various\nleukocytes (white blood cells) involved in immune response.\nThe cell found in greatest abundance in blood is the erythrocyte. Erythrocytes are counted in millions in a blood sample:\nthe average number of red blood cells in primates is 4.7 to 5.5 million cells per microliter. Erythrocytes are consistently the\nsame size in a species, but vary in size between species. For example, the average diameter of a primate red blood cell is 7.5\num, a dog is close at 7.0 um, but a cat\u2019s RBC diameter is 5.9 um. Sheep erythrocytes are even smaller at 4.6 um. Mammalian\nerythrocytes lose their nuclei and mitochondria when they are released from the bone marrow where they are made. Fish,\namphibian, and avian red blood cells maintain their nuclei and mitochondria throughout the cell\u2019s life. The principal job of\nan erythrocyte is to carry and deliver oxygen to the tissues.\nLeukocytes are the predominant white blood cells found in the peripheral blood. Leukocytes are counted in the thousands in\nthe blood with measurements expressed as ranges: primate counts range from 4,800 to 10,800 cells per \u00b5l, dogs from 5,600\nto 19,200 cells per \u00b5l, cats from 8,000 to 25,000 cells per \u00b5l, cattle from 4,000 to 12,000 cells per \u00b5l, and pigs from 11,000\nto 22,000 cells per \u00b5l.\nLymphocytes function primarily in the immune response to foreign antigens or material. Different types of lymphocytes\nmake antibodies tailored to the foreign antigens and control the production of those antibodies. Neutrophils are phagocytic\ncells and they participate in one of the early lines of defense against microbial invaders, aiding in the removal of bacteria\nthat has entered the body. Another leukocyte that is found in the peripheral blood is the monocyte. Monocytes give rise to\n1034\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nphagocytic macrophages that clean up dead and damaged cells in the body, whether they are foreign or from the host animal.\nTwo additional leukocytes in the blood are eosinophils and basophils\u2014both help to facilitate the inflammatory response.\nThe slightly granular material among the cells is a cytoplasmic fragment of a cell in the bone marrow. This is called a\nplatelet or thrombocyte. Platelets participate in the stages leading up to coagulation of the blood to stop bleeding through\ndamaged blood vessels. Blood has a number of functions, but primarily it transports material through the body to bring\nnutrients to cells and remove waste material from them.\nMuscle Tissues\nThere are three types of muscle in animal bodies: smooth, skeletal, and cardiac. They differ by the presence or absence of\nstriations or bands, the number and location of nuclei, whether they are voluntarily or involuntarily controlled, and their\nlocation within the body. Table 24.4 summarizes these differences.\nTypes of Muscles\nType of Muscle\nStriations\nNuclei\nControl\nLocation\nsmooth\nno\nsingle, in center\ninvoluntary\nvisceral organs\nskeletal\nyes\nmany, at periphery voluntary\nskeletal muscles\ncardiac\nyes\nsingle, in center\ninvoluntary\nheart\nTable 24.4\nSmooth Muscle\nSmooth muscle does not have striations in its cells. It has a single, centrally located nucleus, as shown in Figure 24.18.\nConstriction of smooth muscle occurs under involuntary, autonomic nervous control and in response to local conditions in\nthe tissues. Smooth muscle tissue is also called non-striated as it lacks the banded appearance of skeletal and cardiac muscle.\nThe walls of blood vessels, the tubes of the digestive system, and the tubes of the reproductive systems are composed of\nmostly smooth muscle.\nFigure 24.18 Smooth muscle cells do not have striations, while skeletal muscle cells do. Cardiac muscle cells have\nstriations, but, unlike the multinucleate skeletal cells, they have only one nucleus. Cardiac muscle tissue also has\nintercalated discs, specialized regions running along the plasma membrane that join adjacent cardiac muscle cells and\nassist in passing an electrical impulse from cell to cell.\nSkeletal Muscle\nSkeletal muscle has striations across its cells caused by the arrangement of the contractile proteins actin and myosin. These\nmuscle cells are relatively long and have multiple nuclei along the edge of the cell. Skeletal muscle is under voluntary,\nsomatic nervous system control and is found in the muscles that move bones. Figure 24.18 illustrates the histology of\nskeletal muscle.\nCardiac Muscle\nCardiac muscle, shown in Figure 24.18, is found only in the heart. Like skeletal muscle, it has cross striations in its cells, but\ncardiac muscle has a single, centrally located nucleus. Cardiac muscle is not under voluntary control but can be influenced\nby the autonomic nervous system to speed up or slow down. An added feature to cardiac muscle cells is a line than extends\nalong the end of the cell as it abuts the next cardiac cell in the row. This line is called an intercalated disc: it assists in\npassing electrical impulse efficiently from one cell to the next and maintains the strong connection between neighboring\ncardiac cells.\nNervous Tissues\nNervous tissues are made of cells specialized to receive and transmit electrical impulses from specific areas of the body\nand to send them to specific locations in the body. The main cell of the nervous system is the neuron, illustrated in Figure\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\n1035\n24.19. The large structure with a central nucleus is the cell body of the neuron. Projections from the cell body are either\ndendrites specialized in receiving input or a single axon specialized in transmitting impulses. Some glial cells are also\nshown. Astrocytes regulate the chemical environment of the nerve cell, and oligodendrocytes insulate the axon so the\nelectrical nerve impulse is transferred more efficiently. Other glial cells that are not shown support the nutritional and waste\nrequirements of the neuron. Some of the glial cells are phagocytic and remove debris or damaged cells from the tissue. A\nnervous tissue consists of neurons and glial cells.\nFigure 24.19 The neuron has projections called dendrites that receive signals and projections called axons that send\nsignals. Also shown are two types of glial cells: astrocytes regulate the chemical environment of the nerve cell, and\noligodendrocytes insulate the axon so the electrical nerve impulse is transferred more efficiently.\nClick through the interactive review (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/tissues) to learn more about epithelial tissues.\nWhy would a single layer of flat epithelial cells rather than cuboidal cells (cube-shaped) cells function more efficiently\nin diffusion?\na.\nAs a single layer of flat epithelia are more tightly knit than cuboidal cells.\nb.\nAs diffusion of nutrients and gas is easier across a single layer of flat epithelial cells than cuboidal cells.\nc.\nAs diffusion of only gases is easier across a single layer of flat epithelial cells than cuboidal cells.\nd.\nAs active transport of nutrients and gas is easier across a single layer of flat epithelial cells than cuboidal\ncells.\n1036\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nPathologist\nA pathologist is a medical doctor or veterinarian who has specialized in the laboratory detection of disease\nin animals, including humans. These professionals complete medical school education and follow it with an\nextensive post-graduate residency at a medical center. A pathologist may oversee clinical laboratories for\nthe evaluation of body tissue and blood samples for the detection of disease or infection. They examine\ntissue specimens through a microscope to identify diseases. Some pathologists perform autopsies to\ndetermine the cause of death and the progression of disease.\n24.3 | Homeostasis\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat is homeostasis?\n\u2022\nWhat factors affect homeostasis?\n\u2022\nWhat are differences between negative and positive feedback mechanisms used in homeostasis?\n\u2022\nWhat are differences between thermoregulation mechanisms in endothermic and ectothermic animals?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nAnimals must be able to maintain homeostasis\u2014the ability to maintain dynamic equilibrium around a set point\u2014while also\nbeing able to respond to changing conditions. For example, as an endotherm, your body temperature remains fairly constant\naround 37\u25e6C or 98.6\u25e6F. If your temperature climbs above the set point, you sweat to cool off; if your temperature drops\nbelow the set point, you shiver to warm up. Your blood glucose levels also remain fairly constant because the liver removes\nglucose from the blood and converts it to glycogen; when the body cells require glucose, glycogen is broken down. (You\ncan probably hypothesize how your liver will respond if you eat a dozen jelly donuts!) The failure to maintain homeostasis\ncan be detrimental and can even cause death. Consequently, negative and/or positive feedback loops regulate homeostasis.\nNegative feedback mechanisms result in slight fluctuations above and below the set point. For example, if you were to\nconsume a dozen jelly donuts, your blood sugar level would rise, and your pancreas would release insulin, a hormone\ninvolved in the conversion of glucose to glycogen, thus returning your blood glucose level to its appropriate set point. By\ncomparison, positive feedback amplifies responses in the same direction, with the variable initiating the response moving\nthe system even further away from the set point. There are fewer examples of positive feedback, but one is the onset of labor\nin childbirth when uterine contractions increase in strength with the secretion of oxytocin, another hormone. However, the\nloss of internal equilibrium due to positive feedback can be detrimental; for example, a small area of damaged heart tissue\ncan precipitate a heart attack which, in turn, damages even more cardiac muscle.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 of the AP\nBiology\u00ae Curriculum Framework. The AP\u00ae Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent\nfoundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP\u00ae exam\nquestions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven Science Practices.\nBig Idea 2\nBiological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to reproduce,\nand to maintain dynamic homeostasis.\nEnduring\nUnderstanding\n2.C\nOrganisms use feedback mechanisms to regulate growth and reproduction, and to maintain\ndynamic homeostasis.\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\n1037\n",
        "summary": "Animal primary tissues in multicellular animals are classified into four main types\u2014epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous\u2014each with specialized structures and functions. Epithelial tissues cover body surfaces, line organs, and are classified by cell shape (squamous, cuboidal, columnar, transitional) and layering (simple, stratified, pseudostratified), serving roles in protection, secretion, absorption, and diffusion. Connective tissues consist of cells within a matrix of fibers and ground substance, including loose/areolar tissue, dense fibrous tissue, cartilage (hyaline, elastic, fibrocartilage), bone, adipose tissue, and blood, functioning in support, storage, transport, and protection. Muscle tissues\u2014smooth, skeletal, and cardiac\u2014differ in striation, nuclei arrangement, control (voluntary or involuntary), and location, enabling movement of the body or internal materials. Nervous tissue is composed of neurons for transmitting electrical signals and glial cells for support, protection, and maintenance of the neuronal environment, enabling communication and coordination within the body."

Some pathologists perform autopsies to\ndetermine the cause of death and the progression of disease.\n24.3 | Homeostasis\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat is homeostasis?\n\u2022\nWhat factors affect homeostasis?\n\u2022\nWhat are differences between negative and positive feedback mechanisms used in homeostasis?\n\u2022\nWhat are differences between thermoregulation mechanisms in endothermic and ectothermic animals?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nAnimals must be able to maintain homeostasis\u2014the ability to maintain dynamic equilibrium around a set point\u2014while also\nbeing able to respond to changing conditions. For example, as an endotherm, your body temperature remains fairly constant\naround 37\u25e6C or 98.6\u25e6F. If your temperature climbs above the set point, you sweat to cool off; if your temperature drops\nbelow the set point, you shiver to warm up. Your blood glucose levels also remain fairly constant because the liver removes\nglucose from the blood and converts it to glycogen; when the body cells require glucose, glycogen is broken down. (You\ncan probably hypothesize how your liver will respond if you eat a dozen jelly donuts!) The failure to maintain homeostasis\ncan be detrimental and can even cause death. Consequently, negative and/or positive feedback loops regulate homeostasis.\nNegative feedback mechanisms result in slight fluctuations above and below the set point. For example, if you were to\nconsume a dozen jelly donuts, your blood sugar level would rise, and your pancreas would release insulin, a hormone\ninvolved in the conversion of glucose to glycogen, thus returning your blood glucose level to its appropriate set point. By\ncomparison, positive feedback amplifies responses in the same direction, with the variable initiating the response moving\nthe system even further away from the set point. There are fewer examples of positive feedback, but one is the onset of labor\nin childbirth when uterine contractions increase in strength with the secretion of oxytocin, another hormone. However, the\nloss of internal equilibrium due to positive feedback can be detrimental; for example, a small area of damaged heart tissue\ncan precipitate a heart attack which, in turn, damages even more cardiac muscle.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 of the AP\nBiology\u00ae Curriculum Framework. The AP\u00ae Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent\nfoundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP\u00ae exam\nquestions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven Science Practices.\nBig Idea 2\nBiological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to reproduce,\nand to maintain dynamic homeostasis.\nEnduring\nUnderstanding\n2.C\nOrganisms use feedback mechanisms to regulate growth and reproduction, and to maintain\ndynamic homeostasis.\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\n1037\nEssential\nKnowledge\n2.C.1 Organisms use feedback mechanisms to maintain their internal environments and\nrespond to external environmental changes.\nScience\nPractice\n7.2 The student can connect concepts in and across domain(s) to generalize or extrapolate\nin and/or across enduring understandings and/or big ideas.\nLearning\nObjective\n2.16 The student is able to connect how organisms use negative feedback to maintain their\ninternal environments.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n2.C.1 Organisms use feedback mechanisms to maintain their internal environments and\nrespond to external environmental changes.\nScience\nPractice\n5.3 The student can evaluate the evidence provided by data sets in relation to a particular\nscientific question.\nLearning\nObjective\n2.17 The student is able to evaluate data that show the effect(s) of changes in\nconcentrations of key molecules on negative feedback mechanisms.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n2.C.1 Organisms use feedback mechanisms to maintain their internal environments and\nrespond to external environmental changes.\nScience\nPractice\n6.4 The student can make claims and predictions about natural phenomena based on\nscientific theories and models.\nLearning\nObjective\n2.18 The student is able to make predictions about how organisms use negative feedback\nmechanisms to maintain their international environments.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n2.C.1 Organisms use feedback mechanisms to maintain their internal environments and\nrespond to external environmental changes.\nScience\nPractice\n6.4 The student can make claims and predictions about natural phenomena based on\nscientific theories and models.\nLearning\nObjective\n2.19 The student is able to make predictions about how positive feedback mechanisms\namplify activities and processes in organisms based on scientific theories and models.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n2.C.1 Organisms use feedback mechanisms to maintain their internal environments and\nrespond to external environmental changes.\nScience\nPractice\n6.1 The student can justify claims with evidence.\nLearning\nObjective\n2.20 The student is able to justify that positive feedback mechanisms amplify responses in\norganisms.\nAnimal organs and organ systems constantly adjust to internal and external changes through a process called homeostasis\n(\u201csteady state\u201d). These changes might be in the level of glucose or calcium in blood or in external temperatures.\nHomeostasis means to maintain dynamic equilibrium in the body. It is dynamic because it is constantly adjusting to the\nchanges that the body\u2019s systems encounter. It is equilibrium because body functions are kept within specific ranges. Even\nan animal that is apparently inactive is maintaining this homeostatic equilibrium.\nHomeostatic Process\nThe goal of homeostasis is the maintenance of equilibrium around a point or value called a set point. While there are normal\nfluctuations from the set point, the body\u2019s systems will usually attempt to go back to this point. A change in the internal or\nexternal environment is called a stimulus and is detected by a receptor; the response of the system is to adjust the deviation\nparameter toward the set point. For instance, if the body becomes too warm, adjustments are made to cool the animal. If the\nblood\u2019s glucose rises after a meal, adjustments are made to lower the blood glucose level by getting the nutrient into tissues\nthat need it or to store it for later use.\nControl of Homeostasis\nWhen a change occurs in an animal\u2019s environment, an adjustment must be made. The receptor senses the change in the\nenvironment, then sends a signal to the control center (in most cases, the brain) which in turn generates a response that\nis signaled to an effector. The effector is a muscle (that contracts or relaxes) or a gland that secretes. Homeostatsis is\n1038\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nmaintained by negative feedback loops. Positive feedback loops actually push the organism further out of homeostasis, but\nmay be necessary for life to occur. Homeostasis is controlled by the nervous and endocrine system of mammals.\nNegative Feedback Mechanisms\nAny homeostatic process that changes the direction of the stimulus is a negative feedback loop. It may either increase or\ndecrease the stimulus, but the stimulus is not allowed to continue as it did before the receptor sensed it. In other words, if a\nlevel is too high, the body does something to bring it down, and conversely, if a level is too low, the body does something\nto make it go up. Hence the term negative feedback. An example is animal maintenance of blood glucose levels. When\nan animal has eaten, blood glucose levels rise. This is sensed by the nervous system. Specialized cells in the pancreas\nsense this, and the hormone insulin is released by the endocrine system. Insulin causes blood glucose levels to decrease,\nas would be expected in a negative feedback system, as illustrated in Figure 24.20. However, if an animal has not eaten\nand blood glucose levels decrease, this is sensed in another group of cells in the pancreas, and the hormone glucagon is\nreleased causing glucose levels to increase. This is still a negative feedback loop, but not in the direction expected by the\nuse of the term \u201cnegative.\u201d Another example of an increase as a result of the feedback loop is the control of blood calcium.\nIf calcium levels decrease, specialized cells in the parathyroid gland sense this and release parathyroid hormone (PTH),\ncausing an increased absorption of calcium through the intestines and kidneys and, possibly, the breakdown of bone in order\nto liberate calcium. The effects of PTH are to raise blood levels of the element. Negative feedback loops are the predominant\nmechanism used in homeostasis.\nFigure 24.20 Blood sugar levels are controlled by a negative feedback loop. (credit: modification of work by Jon\nSullivan)\nPositive Feedback Loop\nA positive feedback loop maintains the direction of the stimulus, possibly accelerating it. Few examples of positive\nfeedback loops exist in animal bodies, but one is found in the cascade of chemical reactions that result in blood clotting,\nor coagulation. As one clotting factor is activated, it activates the next factor in sequence until a fibrin clot is achieved.\nThe direction is maintained, not changed, so this is positive feedback. Another example of positive feedback is uterine\ncontractions during childbirth, as illustrated in Figure 24.21. The hormone oxytocin, made by the endocrine system,\nstimulates the contraction of the uterus. This produces pain sensed by the nervous system. Instead of lowering the oxytocin\nand causing the pain to subside, more oxytocin is produced until the contractions are powerful enough to produce childbirth.\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\n1039\nFigure 24.21 The birth of a human infant is the result of positive feedback.\nState whether each of the following processes is regulated by a positive or negative feedback loop.\na. A person feels satiated after eating a large meal.\nb. The blood has plenty of red blood cells. As a result, erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the production of new\nred blood cells, is no longer released from the kidney.\na.\na. This is regulated by a positive feedback loop as the stimulus (hunger) has changed direction in response to\na signal (fullness).\nb. This is regulated by a positive feedback loop as the stimulus (red blood cell release) has changed direction\nin response to a signal (presence of enough red blood cells).\nb.\na. This is regulated by a negative feedback loop as the stimulus (hunger) has changed direction in response\nto a signal (fullness).\nb. This is regulated by a positive feedback loop as the direction of the stimulus has been maintained.\nc.\na. This is regulated by a positive feedback loop as the stimulus (hunger) has changed direction in response to\na signal (fullness).\nb. This is regulated by a negative feedback loop as the stimulus (red blood cell release) has changed direction\nin response to a signal (presence of enough red blood cells).\nd.\na. This is regulated by a negative feedback loop as the stimulus (hunger) changed direction in response to a\nsignal (fullness).\nb. This is regulated by a negative feedback loop as the stimulus (red blood cell release) changed direction in\nresponse to a signal (presence of enough red blood cells).\nSet Point\nIt is possible to adjust a system\u2019s set point. When this happens, the feedback loop works to maintain the new setting. An\nexample of this is blood pressure: over time, the normal or set point for blood pressure can increase as a result of continued\nincreases in blood pressure. The body no longer recognizes the elevation as abnormal and no attempt is made to return to\nthe lower set point. The result is the maintenance of an elevated blood pressure that can have harmful effects on the body.\nMedication can lower blood pressure and lower the set point in the system to a more healthy level. This is called a process\nof alteration of the set point in a feedback loop.\nChanges can be made in a group of body organ systems in order to maintain a set point in another system. This is called\nacclimatization. This occurs, for instance, when an animal migrates to a higher altitude than it is accustomed to. In order\nto adjust to the lower oxygen levels at the new altitude, the body increases the number of red blood cells circulating in the\n1040\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nblood to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to the tissues. Another example of acclimatization is animals that have seasonal\nchanges in their coats: a heavier coat in the winter ensures adequate heat retention, and a light coat in summer assists in\nkeeping body temperature from rising to harmful levels.\nFeedback mechanisms can be understood in terms of driving a race car along a track: watch a short video lesson\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/feedback_loops) on positive and negative feedback loops.\nVoltage-gated sodium channels occur in the cell membranes of nerve cells. They open in response to sodium entering\nthe cell, which in turn, allows more sodium to enter the cell. Is this a positive or negative feedback loop and why?\na.\nThis is a positive feedback loop as voltage-gated sodium channels open in response to sodium influx and\nthen close when enough sodium has entered through the channels.\nb.\nThis is a negative feedback loop as voltage-gated sodium channels open in response to sodium influx and\nthen close when enough sodium has entered through the channels.\nc.\nThis is a positive feedback loop as voltage-gated sodium channels open in response to sodium influx, which\nallows more sodium to go in through the channels.\nd.\nThis is a negative feedback loop as voltage-gated sodium channels open in response to sodium influx, which\nallows more sodium to go in through the channels.\nThink About It\nHow are negative feedback loops used to regulate body homeostasis? How is a condition such as diabetes a good\nexample of the failure of a set point in humans? Hypothesize and draw a diagram that shows what you think is the\nfeedback failure for a person with diabetes.\nHomeostasis: Thermoregulation\nBody temperature affects body activities. Generally, as body temperature rises, enzyme activity rises as well. For every ten\ndegree centigrade rise in temperature, enzyme activity doubles, up to a point. Body proteins, including enzymes, begin to\ndenature and lose their function with high heat (around 50oC for mammals). Enzyme activity will decrease by half for every\nten degree centigrade drop in temperature, to the point of freezing, with a few exceptions. Some fish can withstand freezing\nsolid and return to normal with thawing.\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\n1041\nWatch this Discovery Channel video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/thermoregulate) on thermoregulation to see\nillustrations of this process in a variety of animals.\nHow does the loose skin of an elephant help it regulate body temperature?\na.\nLoose skin is thicker, which allows the excess heat to dissipate quickly through the skin.\nb.\nLoose skin brings more heat and blood to the body surface, facilitating heat loss.\nc.\nLoose skin contains greater skin area, which allows excess heat to dissipate as heat loss occurs through the\nskin.\nd.\nLoose skin has smaller skin area, which allows excess heat to dissipate as heat loss occurs through the skin.\nEndotherms and Ectotherms\nAnimals can be divided into two groups: some maintain a constant body temperature in the face of differing environmental\ntemperatures, while others have a body temperature that is the same as their environment and thus varies with the\nenvironment. Animals that do not control their body temperature are ectotherms. This group has been called cold-blooded,\nbut the term may not apply to an animal in the desert with a very warm body temperature. In contrast to ectotherms,\nwhich rely on external temperatures to set their body temperatures, poikilotherms are animals with constantly varying\ninternal temperatures. An animal that maintains a constant body temperature in the face of environmental changes is called\na homeotherm. Endotherms are animals that rely on internal sources for body temperature but which can exhibit extremes\nin temperature. These animals are able to maintain a level of activity at cooler temperature, which an ectotherm cannot due\nto differing enzyme levels of activity.\nHeat can be exchanged between an animal and its environment through four mechanisms: radiation, evaporation,\nconvection, and conduction (Figure 24.22). Radiation is the emission of electromagnetic \u201cheat\u201d waves. Heat comes from\nthe sun in this manner and radiates from dry skin the same way. Heat can be removed with liquid from a surface during\nevaporation. This occurs when a mammal sweats. Convection currents of air remove heat from the surface of dry skin as\nthe air passes over it. Heat will be conducted from one surface to another during direct contact with the surfaces, such as an\nanimal resting on a warm rock.\n1042\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 24.22 Heat can be exchanged by four mechanisms: (a) radiation, (b) evaporation, (c) convection, or (d)\nconduction.

For that reason, reptiles, such as\nthis American alligator, bask in the sun to warm themselves.\nIf an American alligator has been basking but gets too hot, how might the alligator cool itself?\na.\nincrease vasodilation\nb.\nsweat\nc.\nmove into shade\nd.\nincrease metabolic rate\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\n1043\nHeat Conservation and Dissipation\nAnimals conserve or dissipate heat in a variety of ways. In certain climates, endothermic animals have some form of\ninsulation, such as fur, fat, feathers, or some combination thereof. Animals with thick fur or feathers create an insulating\nlayer of air between their skin and internal organs. Polar bears and seals live and swim in a subfreezing environment and\nyet maintain a constant, warm, body temperature. The arctic fox, for example, uses its fluffy tail as extra insulation when\nit curls up to sleep in cold weather. Mammals have a residual effect from shivering and increased muscle activity: arrector\npili muscles cause \u201cgoose bumps,\u201d causing small hairs to stand up when the individual is cold; this has the intended effect\nof increasing body temperature. Mammals use layers of fat to achieve the same end. Loss of significant amounts of body fat\nwill compromise an individual\u2019s ability to conserve heat.\nEndotherms use their circulatory systems to help maintain body temperature. Vasodilation brings more blood and heat to the\nbody surface, facilitating radiation and evaporative heat loss, which helps to cool the body. Vasoconstriction reduces blood\nflow in peripheral blood vessels, forcing blood toward the core and the vital organs found there, and conserving heat. Some\nanimals have adaptions to their circulatory system that enable them to transfer heat from arteries to veins, warming blood\nreturning to the heart. This is called a countercurrent heat exchange; it prevents the cold venous blood from cooling the\nheart and other internal organs. This adaption can be shut down in some animals to prevent overheating the internal organs.\nThe countercurrent adaption is found in many animals, including dolphins, sharks, bony fish, bees, and hummingbirds. In\ncontrast, similar adaptations can help cool endotherms when needed, such as dolphin flukes and elephant ears.\nSome ectothermic animals use changes in their behavior to help regulate body temperature. For example, a desert\nectothermic animal may simply seek cooler areas during the hottest part of the day in the desert to keep from getting too\nwarm. The same animals may climb onto rocks to capture heat during a cold desert night. Some animals seek water to aid\nevaporation in cooling them, as seen with reptiles. Other ectotherms use group activity such as the activity of bees to warm\na hive to survive winter.\nMany animals, especially mammals, use metabolic waste heat as a heat source. When muscles are contracted, most of\nthe energy from the ATP used in muscle actions is wasted energy that translates into heat. Severe cold elicits a shivering\nreflex that generates heat for the body. Many species also have a type of adipose tissue called brown fat that specializes in\ngenerating heat.\nNeural Control of Thermoregulation\nThe nervous system is important to thermoregulation, as illustrated in Figure 24.22. The processes of homeostasis and\ntemperature control are centered in the hypothalamus of the advanced animal brain.\n1044\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 24.24 The body is able to regulate temperature in response to signals from the nervous system.\nWhen bacteria are destroyed by leukocytes, pyrogens are released into the blood. Pyrogens reset the body\u2019s thermostat\nto a higher temperature, resulting in fever. How do pyrogens cause body temperature to rise?\na.\nPyrogens circulate to the hypothalamus to reset the body\u2019s \u201cthermostat,\u201d causing a rise in temperature.\nb.\nPyrogens circulate to the thalamus to reset the body\u2019s \u201cthermostat,\u201d causing a rise in temperature.\nc.\nPyrogens cause an increase in the activity of the animal\u2019s enzymes, which results in the temperature rise.\nd.\nPyrogens entering the blood release some lipid substances, which ultimately cause the rise in temperature.\nThe hypothalamus maintains the set point for body temperature through reflexes that cause vasodilation and sweating when\nthe body is too warm, or vasoconstriction and shivering when the body is too cold. It responds to chemicals from the body.\nWhen a bacterium is destroyed by phagocytic leukocytes, chemicals called endogenous pyrogens are released into the blood.\nThese pyrogens circulate to the hypothalamus and reset the thermostat. This allows the body\u2019s temperature to increase in\nwhat is commonly called a fever. An increase in body temperature causes iron to be conserved, which reduces a nutrient\nneeded by bacteria. An increase in body heat also increases the activity of the animal\u2019s enzymes and protective cells while\ninhibiting the enzymes and activity of the invading microorganisms. Finally, heat itself may also kill the pathogen. A fever\nthat was once thought to be a complication of an infection is now understood to be a normal defense mechanism.\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\n1045\nacclimatization\nalteration\napodeme\nasymmetrical\nbasal metabolic rate (BMR)\ncanaliculus\ncartilage\nchondrocyte\ncolumnar epithelia\nconnective tissue\ncuboidal epithelia\ndorsal cavity\nectotherm\nendotherm\nepithelial tissue\nestivation\nfibrous connective tissue\nfrontal (coronal) plane\nfusiform\nhibernation\nhomeostasis\nlacuna\nloose (areolar) connective tissue\nmatrix\nmidsagittal plane\nnegative feedback loop\nosteon\npositive feedback loop\npseudostratified\nsagittal plane\nKEY TERMS\nalteration in a body system in response to environmental change\nchange of the set point in a homeostatic system\ningrowth of an animal\u2019s exoskeleton that functions as an attachment site for muscles\ndescribes animals with no axis of symmetry in their body pattern\nmetabolic rate at rest in endothermic animals\nmicrochannel that connects the lacunae and aids diffusion between cells\ntype of connective tissue with a large amount of ground substance matrix, cells called chondrocytes, and some\namount of fibers\ncell found in cartilage\nepithelia made of cells taller than they are wide, specialized in absorption\ntype of tissue made of cells, ground substance matrix, and fibers\nepithelia made of cube-shaped cells, specialized in glandular functions\nbody cavity on the posterior or back portion of an animal; includes the cranial and vertebral cavities\nanimal incapable of maintaining a relatively constant internal body temperature\nanimal capable of maintaining a relatively constant internal body temperature\ntissue that either lines or covers organs or other tissues\ntorpor in response to extremely high temperatures and low water availability\ntype of connective tissue with a high concentration of fibers\nplane cutting through an animal separating the individual into front and back portions\nanimal body shape that is tubular and tapered at both ends\ntorpor over a long period of time, such as a winter\ndynamic equilibrium maintaining appropriate body functions\nspace in cartilage and bone that contains living cells\ntype of connective tissue with small amounts of cells, matrix, and fibers; found\naround blood vessels\ncomponent of connective tissue made of both living and non-living (ground substances) cells\nplane cutting through an animal separating the individual into even right and left sides\nfeedback to a control mechanism that increases or decreases a stimulus instead of maintaining\nit\nsubunit of compact bone\nfeedback to a control mechanism that continues the direction of a stimulus\nlayer of epithelia that appears multilayered, but is a simple covering\nplane cutting through an animal separating the individual into right and left sides\n1046\nChapter 24 | The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nset point\nsimple epithelia\nsquamous epithelia\nstandard metabolic rate (SMR)\nstratified epithelia\nthermoregulation\ntorpor\ntrabecula\ntransitional epithelia\ntransverse (horizontal) plane\nventral cavity\nmidpoint or target point in homeostasis\nsingle layer of epithelial cells\ntype of epithelia made of flat cells, specialized in aiding diffusion or preventing abrasion\nmetabolic rate at rest in ectothermic animals\nmultiple layers of epithelial cells\nregulation of body temperature\ndecrease in activity and metabolism that allows an animal to survive adverse conditions\ntiny plate that makes up spongy bone and gives it strength\nepithelia that can transition for appearing multilayered to simple; also called uroepithelial\nplane cutting through an animal separating the individual into upper and lower portions\nbody cavity on the anterior or front portion of an animal that includes the thoracic cavities and the\nabdominopelvic cavities",
        "summary": "Homeostasis is the process by which animals maintain dynamic equilibrium around a set point despite internal and external changes, involving constant adjustments to keep body functions within specific ranges. It is regulated mainly by the nervous and endocrine systems through feedback mechanisms. Negative feedback loops counteract deviations from the set point, such as regulating blood glucose via insulin and glucagon or controlling blood calcium via parathyroid hormone, and are the predominant method of regulation. Positive feedback loops, which amplify changes, are less common and occur in processes like childbirth and blood clotting. Set points can be altered over time or adjusted through acclimatization to environmental changes. Thermoregulation, a key aspect of homeostasis, involves maintaining body temperature through mechanisms like insulation, vasodilation, vasoconstriction, countercurrent heat exchange, shivering, brown fat metabolism, or behavioral adjustments, with endotherms generating internal heat and ectotherms relying on environmental heat sources. The hypothalamus plays a central role in thermal regulation and can induce fever via pyrogens as a defense mechanism against infection. Heat exchange with the environment occurs through radiation, evaporation, convection, and conduction, and various physiological and behavioral strategies help conserve or dissipate heat to sustain homeostasis."

(credit: modification of\nwork by Julie Rybarczyk)\nChapter Outline\n25.1: Digestive Systems\n25.2: Nutrition and Energy Production\n25.3: Digestive System Processes\n25.4: Digestive System Regulation\nIntroduction\nAll living organisms need nutrients to survive. Animals obtain their nutrients by the consumption of other organisms. At\nthe cellular level, the biological molecules necessary for animal function are amino acids, lipid molecules, nucleotides, and\nsimple sugars. However, the food consumed consists of protein, fat, and complex carbohydrates. Animals must convert\nthese macromolecules into the simple molecules required for maintaining cellular functions, such as assembling new\nmolecules, cells, and tissues. The conversion of the food consumed to the nutrients required is a multi-step process involving\ndigestion and absorption. During digestion, food particles are broken down into smaller components; later, they are absorbed\nby the body.\nOne of the challenges in human nutrition is maintaining a balance between food intake, storage, and energy expenditure.\nImbalances can have serious health consequences. For example, eating too much food while not expending much energy\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\n1057\nleads to obesity; this in turn will increase the risk of developing illnesses such as type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\nThe recent rise in obesity and related diseases makes understanding the role of diet and nutrition in maintaining good health\nall the more important. Many health experts believe that nutrition education will improve the overall health of the entire\npopulation. In fact, one nutrition education program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),\n[1] focused\non preschool-aged children enrolled in a low-cost childcare setting and found that participating children were significantly\nmore likely to eat more vegetables at home. You can read more about SNAP here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32SNAP)\n.\n25.1 | Digestive Systems\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the differences between digestion and absorption?\n\u2022\nWhat are different types of digestive systems in invertebrates and vertebrates?\n\u2022\nWhat are the specialized functions of the organs involved in processing food in the human body?\n\u2022\nHow do organs work together to digest food and absorb nutrients?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nMuch information in this chapter is not within the scope of AP\u00ae. However, the chapter provides us with the opportunity to\nreview concepts we\u2019ve explored previously, including structure and function, macromolecules, energy production, transport\nof substances across membranes, and enzyme activity. All living organisms require a source of energy and molecules\nneeded to build cells, tissues, and organs. During digestion, food is broken down into smaller molecules for absorption\nand distribution to all cells of the body. Nutrients are required to carry out cellular processes and maintain homeostasis,\nand digestion and absorption require the participation of several organs. Different animals have evolved different types of\ndigestive systems specialized to meet their dietary needs. You do not need to memorize details about the different types of\nanimal digestive systems, but you might find it interesting to explore the evolution of the system through a few groups of\nanimals, from intracellular digestion in simple invertebrates to a digestive tract and accessory organs in complex vertebrates.\nUsing a human eating a turkey sandwich as an example, food is ingested through the mouth. The mouth is the location\nwhere both mechanical (chewing) and chemical breakdown of food begins via the enzyme amylase, which breaks down\ncarbohydrates into simpler sugars. The food bolus then travels by peristalsis (alternating waves of contraction) down the\npharynx and esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, pepsinogen mixes with hydrochloric acid to form pepsin, which\nbegins digesting proteins, such as turkey, into smaller chains of amino acids. Mucus in the stomach protects its lining\nfrom damage by acidity, and the tightening of a sphincter prevents stomach contents from regurgitating into the esophagus.\nFurther digestion of the ingredients of the sandwich occurs in the small intestine aided by a variety of enzymes; for example,\nbile salts and pancreatic amylase dumped into the small intestine from the gallbladder and pancreas, respectively, help\nemulsify fats. Once the ingredients of the sandwich have been broken down into smaller nutrient molecules, including\namino acids, glucose, and fatty acids, they are absorbed from the small intestine into the circulatory and lymphatic systems.\nThe walls of the small intestine contain small, finger-like projections called villi and microvilli that increase surface area\nfor absorption of nutrients by diffusion. The large intestine or colon does not produce digestive enzymes but functions to\nabsorb water, salts, and some vitamins. Any nutrients from the sandwich are stored in the liver, and wastes are eliminated.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 and Big Idea 4\nof the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP\u00ae Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide\na transparent foundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and\nAP\u00ae exam questions.

Depending on their diet, animals can be classified into\nthe following categories: plant eaters (herbivores), meat eaters (carnivores), and those that eat both plants and animals\n(omnivores). The nutrients and macromolecules present in food are not immediately accessible to the cells. There are a\nnumber of processes that modify food within the animal body to make the nutrients and organic molecules accessible for\ncellular function. As animals evolved in complexity of form and function, their digestive systems have also evolved to\naccommodate their various dietary needs.\nHerbivores, Omnivores, and Carnivores\nHerbivores are animals whose primary food source is plant-based. Examples of herbivores, as shown in Figure 25.2\ninclude vertebrates like deer, koalas, and some bird species, as well as invertebrates such as crickets and caterpillars. These\nanimals have evolved digestive systems capable of handling large amounts of plant material. Herbivores can be further\nclassified into frugivores (fruit-eaters), granivores (seed eaters), nectivores (nectar feeders), and folivores (leaf eaters).\nFigure 25.2 Herbivores, like this (a) mule deer and (b) monarch caterpillar, eat primarily plant material. (credit a:\nmodification of work by Bill Ebbesen; credit b: modification of work by Doug Bowman)\nCarnivores are animals that eat other animals. The word carnivore is derived from Latin and literally means \u201cmeat eater.\u201d\nWild cats such as lions, shown in Figure 25.3a and tigers are examples of vertebrate carnivores, as are snakes and sharks,\nwhile invertebrate carnivores include sea stars, spiders, and ladybugs, shown in Figure 25.3b. Obligate carnivores are those\nthat rely entirely on animal flesh to obtain their nutrients; examples of obligate carnivores are members of the cat family,\nsuch as lions and cheetahs. Facultative carnivores are those that also eat non-animal food in addition to animal food. Note\nthat there is no clear line that differentiates facultative carnivores from omnivores; dogs would be considered facultative\ncarnivores.\n1060\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 25.3 Carnivores like the (a) lion eat primarily meat. The (b) ladybug is also a carnivore that consumes small\ninsects called aphids. (credit a: modification of work by Kevin Pluck; credit b: modification of work by Jon Sullivan)\nOmnivores are animals that eat both plant- and animal-derived food. In Latin, omnivore means to eat everything.\nHumans, bears (shown in Figure 25.4a), and chickens are example of vertebrate omnivores; invertebrate omnivores include\ncockroaches and crayfish (shown in Figure 25.4b).\nFigure 25.4 Omnivores like the (a) bear and (b) crayfish eat both plant and animal based food. (credit a: modification\nof work by Dave Menke; credit b: modification of work by Jon Sullivan)\nInvertebrate Digestive Systems\nAnimals have evolved different types of digestive systems to aid in the digestion of the various foods they consume.\nThe simplest example is that of a gastrovascular cavity and is found in organisms with only one opening for digestion.\nPlatyhelminthes (flatworms), Ctenophora (comb jellies), and Cnidaria (coral, jelly fish, and sea anemones) use this type of\ndigestion. Gastrovascular cavities, as shown in Figure 25.5a, are typically a blind tube or cavity with only one opening, the\n\u201cmouth\u201d, which also serves as an \u201canus\u201d. Ingested material enters the mouth and passes through a hollow, tubular cavity.\nCells within the cavity secrete digestive enzymes that break down the food. The food particles are engulfed by the cells\nlining the gastrovascular cavity.\nThe alimentary canal, shown in Figure 25.5b, is a more advanced system: it consists of one tube with a mouth at one\nend and an anus at the other. Earthworms are an example of an animal with an alimentary canal. Once the food is ingested\nthrough the mouth, it passes through the esophagus and is stored in an organ called the crop; then it passes into the gizzard\nwhere it is churned and digested. From the gizzard, the food passes through the intestine, the nutrients are absorbed, and the\nwaste is eliminated as feces, called castings, through the anus.\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\n1061\nFigure 25.5 (a) A gastrovascular cavity has a single opening through which food is ingested and waste is excreted, as\nshown in this hydra and in this jellyfish medusa. (b) An alimentary canal has two openings: a mouth for ingesting food,\nand an anus for eliminating waste, as shown in this nematode.\nVertebrate Digestive Systems\nThrough evolution, vertebrate digestive systems have adapted to different diets. Some animals have a single stomach, while\nothers have multi-chambered stomachs. Birds have developed a digestive system adapted to eating unmasticated food.\nMonogastric: Single-chambered Stomach\nAs the word monogastric suggests, this type of digestive system consists of one (\u201cmono\u201d) stomach chamber (\u201cgastric\u201d).\nHumans and many animals have a monogastric digestive system as illustrated in Figure 25.6ab. The process of digestion\nbegins with the mouth and the intake of food. The teeth play an important role in masticating (chewing) or physically\nbreaking down food into smaller particles. The enzymes present in saliva also begin to chemically break down food. The\nesophagus is a long tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. Using peristalsis, or wave-like smooth muscle contractions,\nthe muscles of the esophagus push the food towards the stomach. In order to speed up the actions of enzymes in the stomach,\nthe stomach is an extremely acidic environment, with a pH between 1.5 and 2.5. The gastric juices, which include enzymes\nin the stomach, act on the food particles and continue the process of digestion. Further breakdown of food takes place in the\nsmall intestine where enzymes produced by the liver, the small intestine, and the pancreas continue the process of digestion.\nThe nutrients are absorbed into the blood stream across the epithelial cells lining the walls of the small intestines. The waste\nmaterial travels on to the large intestine where water is absorbed and the drier waste material is compacted into feces; it is\nstored until it is excreted through the rectum.\n1062\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 25.6 (a) Humans and herbivores, such as the (b) rabbit, have a monogastric digestive system. However, in\nthe rabbit the small intestine and cecum are enlarged to allow more time to digest plant material. The enlarged organ\nprovides more surface area for absorption of nutrients. Rabbits digest their food twice: the first time food passes\nthrough the digestive system, it collects in the cecum, and then it passes through the anus as soft feces called\ncecotrophes. The rabbit re-ingests these cecotrophes to further digest them.\nAvian\nBirds face special challenges when it comes to obtaining nutrition from food. They do not have teeth and so their digestive\nsystem, shown in Figure 25.7, must be able to process un-masticated food. Birds have evolved a variety of beak types that\nreflect the vast variety in their diet, ranging from seeds and insects to fruits and nuts. Because most birds fly, their metabolic\nrates are high in order to efficiently process food and keep their body weight low. The stomach of birds has two chambers:\nthe proventriculus, where gastric juices are produced to digest the food before it enters the stomach, and the gizzard,\nwhere the food is stored, soaked, and mechanically ground. The undigested material forms food pellets that are sometimes\nregurgitated. Most of the chemical digestion and absorption happens in the intestine and the waste is excreted through the\ncloaca.\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\n1063\nFigure 25.7 The avian esophagus has a pouch, called a crop, which stores food. Food passes from the crop to\nthe first of two stomachs, called the proventriculus, which contains digestive juices that break down food. From the\nproventriculus, the food enters the second stomach, called the gizzard, which grinds food. Some birds swallow stones\nor grit, which are stored in the gizzard, to aid the grinding process. Birds do not have separate openings to excrete\nurine and feces. Instead, uric acid from the kidneys is secreted into the large intestine and combined with waste from\nthe digestive process. This waste is excreted through an opening called the cloaca.\n1064\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nAvian Adaptations\nBirds have a highly efficient, simplified digestive system. Recent fossil evidence has shown that the\nevolutionary divergence of birds from other land animals was characterized by streamlining and simplifying\nthe digestive system. Unlike many other animals, birds do not have teeth to chew their food. In place of\nlips, they have sharp pointy beaks. The horny beak, lack of jaws, and the smaller tongue of the birds can\nbe traced back to their dinosaur ancestors. The emergence of these changes seems to coincide with the\ninclusion of seeds in the bird diet. Seed-eating birds have beaks that are shaped for grabbing seeds and\nthe two-compartment stomach allows for delegation of tasks. Since birds need to remain light in order to fly,\ntheir metabolic rates are very high, which means they digest their food very quickly and need to eat often.\nContrast this with the ruminants, where the digestion of plant matter takes a very long time.\nAlthough both birds and humans are vertebrates, birds have a relatively higher metabolic rate than humans.\na. Why is the metabolic rate of birds relatively higher than that of humans?\nb. How do birds compensate for such a high metabolism?\na.\na. Birds have smaller surfaces to lose heat than humans, so their metabolic rate must be higher.\nb. Birds need to eat greater amounts of food since they digest food quickly.\nb.\na. Birds need to be light to fly, so they need to digest their food faster than humans.\nb. Birds need to eat greater amounts of food since they digest food quickly.\nc.\na. Birds have smaller surfaces to lose heat than humans, so their metabolic rate must be higher.\nb. Birds need to eat often to maintain energy since they digest food quickly.\nd.\na. Birds need to be light to fly, so they need to digest their food faster than humans.\nb. Birds need to eat often to maintain energy since they digest food quickly.\nRuminants\nRuminants are mainly herbivores like cows, sheep, and goats, whose entire diet consists of eating large amounts of\nroughage or fiber. They have evolved digestive systems that help them digest vast amounts of cellulose. An interesting\nfeature of the ruminants\u2019 mouth is that they do not have upper incisor teeth. They use their lower teeth, tongue and lips to\ntear and chew their food. From the mouth, the food travels to the esophagus and on to the stomach.\nTo help digest the large amount of plant material, the stomach of the ruminants is a multi-chambered organ, as illustrated\nin Figure 25.8. The four compartments of the stomach are called the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. These\nchambers contain many microbes that break down cellulose and ferment ingested food. The abomasum is the \u201ctrue\u201d stomach\nand is the equivalent of the monogastric stomach chamber where gastric juices are secreted. The four-compartment gastric\nchamber provides larger space and the microbial support necessary to digest plant material in ruminants. The fermentation\nprocess produces large amounts of gas in the stomach chamber, which must be eliminated. As in other animals, the small\nintestine plays an important role in nutrient absorption, and the large intestine helps in the elimination of waste.\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\n1065\nFigure 25.8 Ruminant animals, such as goats and cows, have four stomachs. The first two stomachs, the rumen and\nthe reticulum, contain prokaryotes and protists that are able to digest cellulose fiber. The ruminant regurgitates cud\nfrom the reticulum, chews it, and swallows it into a third stomach, the omasum, which removes water. The cud then\npasses onto the fourth stomach, the abomasum, where it is digested by enzymes produced by the ruminant.\nPseudo-ruminants\nSome animals, such as camels and alpacas, are pseudo-ruminants. They eat a lot of plant material and roughage. Digesting\nplant material is not easy because plant cell walls contain the polymeric sugar molecule cellulose. The digestive enzymes of\nthese animals cannot break down cellulose, but microorganisms present in the digestive system can. Therefore, the digestive\nsystem must be able to handle large amounts of roughage and break down the cellulose. Pseudo-ruminants have a three-\nchamber stomach in the digestive system. However, their cecum\u2014a pouched organ at the beginning of the large intestine\ncontaining many microorganisms that are necessary for the digestion of plant materials\u2014is large and is the site where the\nroughage is fermented and digested. These animals do not have a rumen but have an omasum, abomasum, and reticulum.\nParts of the Digestive System\nThe vertebrate digestive system is designed to facilitate the transformation of food matter into the nutrient components that\nsustain organisms.\nOral Cavity\nThe oral cavity, or mouth, is the point of entry of food into the digestive system, illustrated in Figure 25.9. The food\nconsumed is broken into smaller particles by mastication, the chewing action of the teeth. All mammals have teeth and can\nchew their food.\nThe extensive chemical process of digestion begins in the mouth. As food is being chewed, saliva, produced by the salivary\nglands, mixes with the food. Saliva is a watery substance produced in the mouths of many animals. There are three major\nglands that secrete saliva\u2014the parotid, the submandibular, and the sublingual. Saliva contains mucus that moistens food and\nbuffers the pH of the food. Saliva also contains immunoglobulins and lysozymes, which have antibacterial action to reduce\ntooth decay by inhibiting growth of some bacteria. Saliva also contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that begins the\nprocess of converting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose. Another enzyme called lipase is produced\nby the cells in the tongue. Lipases are a class of enzymes that can break down triglycerides. The lingual lipase begins the\nbreakdown of fat components in the food. The chewing and wetting action provided by the teeth and saliva prepare the food\ninto a mass called the bolus for swallowing. The tongue helps in swallowing\u2014moving the bolus from the mouth into the\npharynx. The pharynx opens to two passageways: the trachea, which leads to the lungs, and the esophagus, which leads to\n1066\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nthe stomach. The trachea has an opening called the glottis, which is covered by a cartilaginous flap called the epiglottis.\nWhen swallowing, the epiglottis closes the glottis and food passes into the esophagus and not the trachea. This arrangement\nallows food to be kept out of the trachea.\nFigure 25.9 Digestion of food begins in the (a) oral cavity. Food is masticated by teeth and moistened by saliva\nsecreted from the (b) salivary glands. Enzymes in the saliva begin to digest starches and fats. With the help of the\ntongue, the resulting bolus is moved into the esophagus by swallowing. (credit: modification of work by the National\nCancer Institute)\nEsophagus\nThe esophagus is a tubular organ that connects the mouth to the stomach. The chewed and softened food passes through the\nesophagus after being swallowed. The smooth muscles of the esophagus undergo a series of wave like movements called\nperistalsis that push the food toward the stomach, as illustrated in Figure 25.10. The peristalsis wave is unidirectional\u2014it\nmoves food from the mouth to the stomach, and reverse movement is not possible. The peristaltic movement of the\nesophagus is an involuntary reflex; it takes place in response to the act of swallowing.\nFigure 25.10 The esophagus transfers food from the mouth to the stomach through peristaltic movements.\nA ring-like muscle called a sphincter forms valves in the digestive system. The gastro-esophageal sphincter is located at\nthe stomach end of the esophagus. In response to swallowing and the pressure exerted by the bolus of food, this sphincter\nopens, and the bolus enters the stomach. When there is no swallowing action, this sphincter is shut and prevents the contents\nof the stomach from traveling up the esophagus. Many animals have a true sphincter; however, in humans, there is no true\nsphincter, but the esophagus remains closed when there is no swallowing action. Acid reflux or \u201cheartburn\u201d occurs when\nthe acidic digestive juices escape into the esophagus.\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\n1067\nStomach\nA large part of digestion occurs in the stomach, shown in Figure 25.11. The stomach is a saclike organ that secretes gastric\ndigestive juices. The pH in the stomach is between 1.5 and 2.5. This highly acidic environment is required for the chemical\nbreakdown of food and the extraction of nutrients. When empty, the stomach is a rather small organ; however, it can expand\nto up to 20 times its resting size when filled with food. This characteristic is particularly useful for animals that need to eat\nwhen food is available.\nFigure 25.11 The human stomach has an extremely acidic environment where most of the protein gets digested.\n(credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nWhich of the following statements about the digestive system is true?\na.\nBile is a mixture of food and digestive juices that is produced in the stomach.\nb.\nFood enters the large intestine before the small intestine.\nc.\nIn the small intestine, chyme mixes with bile, which emulsifies fats.\nd.\nThe large intestines are separated from the small intestines by the pyloric sphincter.\nThe stomach is the major site for protein digestion in animals other than ruminants. Protein digestion is mediated by an\nenzyme called pepsin in the stomach chamber. Pepsin is secreted by the chief cells in the stomach in an inactive form\ncalled pepsinogen. Pepsin breaks peptide bonds and cleaves proteins into smaller polypeptides; it also helps activate more\npepsinogen, starting a positive feedback mechanism that generates more pepsin. Another cell type\u2014parietal cells\u2014secretes\nhydrogen and chloride ions, which combine in the lumen to form hydrochloric acid, the primary acidic component of the\nstomach juices. Hydrochloric acid helps to convert the inactive pepsinogen to pepsin. The highly acidic environment also\nkills many microorganisms in the food and, combined with the action of the enzyme pepsin, results in the hydrolysis of\nprotein in the food. Chemical digestion is facilitated by the churning action of the stomach. Contraction and relaxation of\nsmooth muscles mixes the stomach contents about every 20 minutes. The partially digested food and gastric juice mixture\nis called chyme. Chyme passes from the stomach to the small intestine. Further protein digestion takes place in the small\nintestine. Gastric emptying occurs within two to six hours after a meal. Only a small amount of chyme is released into the\nsmall intestine at a time. The movement of chyme from the stomach into the small intestine is regulated by the pyloric\nsphincter.\nWhen digesting protein and some fats, the stomach lining must be protected from getting digested by pepsin. There are\ntwo points to consider when describing how the stomach lining is protected. First, as previously mentioned, the enzyme\npepsin is synthesized in the inactive form. This protects the chief cells, because pepsinogen does not have the same enzyme\nfunctionality of pepsin. Second, the stomach has a thick mucus lining that protects the underlying tissue from the action of\nthe digestive juices. When this mucus lining is ruptured, ulcers can form in the stomach. Ulcers are open wounds in or on\n1068\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nan organ caused by bacteria (Helicobacter pylori) when the mucus lining is ruptured and fails to reform.\nSmall Intestine\nChyme moves from the stomach to the small intestine. The small intestine is the organ where the digestion of protein, fats,\nand carbohydrates is completed. The small intestine is a long tube-like organ with a highly folded surface containing finger-\nlike projections called the villi. The apical surface of each villus has many microscopic projections called microvilli. These\nstructures, illustrated in Figure 25.12, are lined with epithelial cells on the luminal side and allow for the nutrients to be\nabsorbed from the digested food and absorbed into the blood stream on the other side. The villi and microvilli, with their\nmany folds, increase the surface area of the intestine and increase absorption efficiency of the nutrients. Absorbed nutrients\nin the blood are carried into the hepatic portal vein, which leads to the liver. There, the liver regulates the distribution of\nnutrients to the rest of the body and removes toxic substances, including drugs, alcohol, and some pathogens.\nFigure 25.12 Villi are folds on the small intestine lining that increase the surface area to facilitate the absorption\nof nutrients.\nWhich of the following statements about the small intestine is true?\na.\nAbsorptive cells that line the small intestine have small projections that increase surface area and aid in the\nabsorption of food.\nb.\nThe outside of the small intestine has many folds, called villi.\nc.\nMicrovilli are lined with blood vessels as well as lymphatic vessels.\nd.\nThe inside of the small intestine is called the lymphatic vessel.\nThe human small intestine is over 6m long and is divided into three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum.\nThe \u201cC-shaped,\u201d fixed part of the small intestine is called the duodenum and is shown in Figure 25.11. The duodenum\nis separated from the stomach by the pyloric sphincter which opens to allow chyme to move from the stomach to the\nduodenum. In the duodenum, chyme is mixed with pancreatic juices in an alkaline solution rich in bicarbonate that\nneutralizes the acidity of chyme and acts as a buffer. Pancreatic juices also contain several digestive enzymes. Digestive\njuices from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, as well as from gland cells of the intestinal wall itself, enter the duodenum.\nBile is produced in the liver and stored and concentrated in the gallbladder. Bile contains bile salts which emulsify lipids\nwhile the pancreas produces enzymes that catabolize starches, disaccharides, proteins, and fats. These digestive juices break\ndown the food particles in the chyme into glucose, triglycerides, and amino acids. Some chemical digestion of food takes\nplace in the duodenum. Absorption of fatty acids also takes place in the duodenum.\nThe second part of the small intestine is called the jejunum, shown in Figure 25.11. Here, hydrolysis of nutrients is\ncontinued while most of the carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal lining. The bulk of chemical\ndigestion and nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum.\nThe ileum, also illustrated in Figure 25.11 is the last part of the small intestine and here the bile salts and vitamins are\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\n1069\nabsorbed into blood stream. The undigested food is sent to the colon from the ileum via peristaltic movements of the muscle.\nThe ileum ends and the large intestine begins at the ileocecal valve. The vermiform, \u201cworm-like,\u201d appendix is located at the\nileocecal valve. The appendix of humans secretes no enzymes and has an insignificant role in immunity.\nFigure 25.13 Transmission electron microscope image of a thin section cut through an epithelial cell from a human\njejunum (segment of the small intestine). The image shows the apical end of an absorptive cell with some of the\ndensely packed microvilli that make up the striated border. Each microvillus is approximately 1 \u03bcm long by 0.1 \u03bcm\nin diameter and contains a core of actin microfilaments. (credit: \u201cMicrovilli\u201d, Wikimedia Commons)\nWhat is the role of microvilli in nutrient absorption?\na.\nMicrovilli form the inner layer of epithelial tissue in the small intestine and increase the absorption of\nnutrients from chyme.\nb.\nMicrovilli are projections of absorptive cells that are involved in the absorption of bile salts and vitamin B12.\nc.\nMicrovilli increase the surface area of absorptive cells, and therefore increase the amount of nutrients that\ncan be absorbed.\nd.\nMicrovilli use smooth muscle contractions to move the chyme, which contains nutrients, thereby increasing\nthe rate of absorption.\nLarge Intestine\nThe large intestine, illustrated in Figure 25.14, reabsorbs the water from the undigested food material and processes the\nwaste material. The human large intestine is much smaller in length compared to the small intestine but larger in diameter.\nIt has three parts: the cecum, the colon, and the rectum. The cecum joins the ileum to the colon and is the receiving pouch\nfor the waste matter. The colon is home to many bacteria or \u201cintestinal flora\u201d that aid in the digestive processes. The colon\ncan be divided into four regions, the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon and the sigmoid colon.\nThe main functions of the colon are to extract the water and mineral salts from undigested food, and to store waste material.\nCarnivorous mammals have a shorter large intestine compared to herbivorous mammals due to their diet.\n1070\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 25.14 The large intestine reabsorbs water from undigested food and stores waste material until it is eliminated.\nRectum and Anus\nThe rectum is the terminal end of the large intestine, as shown in Figure 25.14. The primary role of the rectum is to store\nthe feces until defecation. The feces are propelled using peristaltic movements during elimination. The anus is an opening\nat the far-end of the digestive tract and is the exit point for the waste material. Two sphincters between the rectum and anus\ncontrol elimination: the inner sphincter is involuntary and the outer sphincter is voluntary.\nAccessory Organs\nThe organs discussed above are the organs of the digestive tract through which food passes. Accessory organs are organs\nthat add secretions (enzymes) that catabolize food into nutrients. Accessory organs include salivary glands, the liver, the\npancreas, and the gallbladder. The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are regulated by hormones in response to the food\nconsumed.\nThe liver is the largest internal organ in humans and it plays a very important role in digestion of fats and detoxifying\nblood. The liver produces bile, a digestive juice that is required for the breakdown of fatty components of the food in the\nduodenum. The liver also processes the vitamins and fats and synthesizes many plasma proteins.\nThe pancreas is another important gland that secretes digestive juices. The chyme produced from the stomach is highly\nacidic in nature; the pancreatic juices contain high levels of bicarbonate, an alkali that neutralizes the acidic chyme.\nAdditionally, the pancreatic juices contain a large variety of enzymes that are required for the digestion of protein and\ncarbohydrates.\nThe gallbladder is a small organ that aids the liver by storing bile and concentrating bile salts. When chyme containing\nfatty acids enters the duodenum, the bile is secreted from the gallbladder into the duodenum.\nActivity\nCreate a mini-poster that shows the procurement, digestion, absorption, and distribution of nutrients through\nthe digestive systems of one invertebrate animal and one vertebrate animal. Explain how the organs of the\nsystem promote efficiency in the use of matter and energy.\nThink About It\nExplain how the villi and microvilli aid in absorption of nutrients from the small intestine into the circulatory system.\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\n1071\n25.2 | Nutrition and Energy Production\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhy must an animal have a balanced diet?\n\u2022\nWhat are the primary components of food?\n\u2022\nWhat are examples of essential nutrients required for cellular function that cannot be synthesized by the animal\nbody?\n\u2022\nHow is energy produced through diet and digestion?\n\u2022\nHow are excess carbohydrates and energy stored in the body?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nMuch of the content described in this module is not within the scope of AP\u00ae. However, as we learn in the chapter on\nbiological macromolecules, in animals the organic molecules required for building cellular materials and tissues come\nfrom food. During digestion, complex carbohydrates are broken down into glucose and used to provide energy through\nmetabolic pathways, such as cellular respiration (see the chapter on cellular respiration). Excess sugars in the body are\nstored as glycogen in the liver and muscles for later use. Another important requirement is nitrogen, and protein catabolism\nprovides a source of nitrogen; amino acids from protein breakdown are building blocks for new proteins. The carbon and\nnitrogen derived from amino acids also become building blocks for nucleic acids. Excess nitrogen is excreted because it\nis toxic. Although the animal body can synthesize many of the molecules necessary for function from organic precursors,\nsome essential nutrients must be consumed from food.

        "summary": "The digestive system enables animals to break down food into nutrients that cells can use, with variations across species to suit different diets. Animals are classified as herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores, each with specialized digestive adaptations. Invertebrate systems range from simple gastrovascular cavities with one opening to complete alimentary canals with separate mouth and anus. Vertebrates show further specialization: monogastric systems (e.g., humans) have a single stomach; birds use a crop, proventriculus, and gizzard for processing unchewed food; ruminants (e.g., cows) have four stomach chambers for cellulose digestion via microbes; pseudo-ruminants (e.g., camels) use a three-chamber stomach with a large cecum. In humans, digestion begins in the oral cavity with mechanical and enzymatic breakdown, continues through the esophagus via peristalsis to the stomach for protein digestion, and proceeds to the small intestine, where most chemical digestion and nutrient absorption occur through villi and microvilli. The large intestine reabsorbs water and minerals, and the rectum and anus eliminate waste. Accessory organs \u2014 salivary glands, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder \u2014 secrete enzymes and other substances like bile to aid digestion and nutrient absorption."

However, as we learn in the chapter on\nbiological macromolecules, in animals the organic molecules required for building cellular materials and tissues come\nfrom food. During digestion, complex carbohydrates are broken down into glucose and used to provide energy through\nmetabolic pathways, such as cellular respiration (see the chapter on cellular respiration). Excess sugars in the body are\nstored as glycogen in the liver and muscles for later use. Another important requirement is nitrogen, and protein catabolism\nprovides a source of nitrogen; amino acids from protein breakdown are building blocks for new proteins. The carbon and\nnitrogen derived from amino acids also become building blocks for nucleic acids. Excess nitrogen is excreted because it\nis toxic. Although the animal body can synthesize many of the molecules necessary for function from organic precursors,\nsome essential nutrients must be consumed from food. Vitamins are another class of essential organic molecules that are\nrequired in small quantities for many enzymes to function.

The diet is also the source of materials\nfor ATP production in the cells. The diet must be balanced to provide the minerals and vitamins that are required for cellular\nfunction.\nFood Requirements\nWhat are the fundamental requirements of the animal diet? The animal diet should be well balanced and provide nutrients\nrequired for bodily function and the minerals and vitamins required for maintaining structure and regulation necessary for\ngood health and reproductive capability. These requirements for a human are illustrated graphically in Figure 25.15\nFigure 25.15 For humans, a balanced diet includes fruits, vegetables, grains, and protein. (credit: USDA)\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\n1073\nThe first step in ensuring that you are meeting the food requirements of your body is an awareness of the food groups\nand the nutrients they provide. To learn more about each food group and the recommended daily amounts, explore this\ninteractive site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/food_groups) by the United States Department of Agriculture.\nHow many cups of vegetables per day are recommended for a 61-year-old woman who does not exercise on a regular\nbasis?\na.\n1.5 cups\nb.\n2 cups\nc.\n2.5 cups\nd.\n3 cups\nLet\u2019s Move! Campaign\nObesity is a growing epidemic and the rate of obesity among children is rapidly rising in the United\nStates. To combat childhood obesity and ensure that children get a healthy start in life, former first\nlady Michelle Obama has launched the Let\u2019s Move! campaign. The goal of this campaign is to educate\nparents and caregivers on providing healthy nutrition and encouraging active lifestyles to future generations.\nThis program aims to involve the entire community, including parents, teachers, and healthcare providers\nto ensure that children have access to healthy foods\u2014more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains\u2014and\nconsume fewer calories from processed foods. Another goal is to ensure that children get physical activity.\nWith the increase in television viewing and stationary pursuits such as video games, sedentary lifestyles\nhave become the norm.

Carbohydrates or sugars\nare the primary source of organic carbons in the animal body. During digestion, digestible carbohydrates are ultimately\nbroken down into glucose and used to provide energy through metabolic pathways. Complex carbohydrates, including\npolysaccharides, can be broken down into glucose through biochemical modification; however, humans do not produce\nthe enzyme cellulase and lack the ability to derive glucose from the polysaccharide cellulose. In humans, these molecules\nprovide the fiber required for moving waste through the large intestine and a healthy colon. The intestinal flora in the human\ngut are able to extract some nutrition from these plant fibers. The excess sugars in the body are converted into glycogen\nand stored in the liver and muscles for later use. Glycogen stores are used to fuel prolonged exertions, such as long-distance\nrunning, and to provide energy during food shortage. Excess glycogen can be converted to fats, which are stored in the lower\nlayer of the skin of mammals for insulation and energy storage. Excess digestible carbohydrates are stored by mammals in\norder to survive famine and aid in mobility.\n1074\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nAnother important requirement is that of nitrogen. Protein catabolism provides a source of organic nitrogen. Amino acids\nare the building blocks of proteins and protein breakdown provides amino acids that are used for cellular function. The\ncarbon and nitrogen derived from these become the building block for nucleotides, nucleic acids, proteins, cells, and tissues.\nExcess nitrogen must be excreted as it is toxic. Fats add flavor to food and promote a sense of satiety or fullness. Fatty foods\nare also significant sources of energy because one gram of fat contains nine calories. Fats are required in the diet to aid the\nabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins and the production of fat-soluble hormones.\nEssential Nutrients\nWhile the animal body can synthesize many of the molecules required for function from the organic precursors, there are\nsome nutrients that need to be consumed from food. These nutrients are termed essential nutrients, meaning they must be\neaten, and the body cannot produce them.\nThe omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid and the omega-6 linoleic acid are essential fatty acids needed to make some membrane\nphospholipids. Vitamins are another class of essential organic molecules that are required in small quantities for many\nenzymes to function and, for this reason, are considered to be co-enzymes. Absence or low levels of vitamins can have\na dramatic effect on health, as outlined in Table 25.1 and Table 25.2. Both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins must\nbe obtained from food. Minerals, listed in Table 25.3, are inorganic essential nutrients that must be obtained from food.\nAmong their many functions, minerals help in structure and regulation and are considered co-factors. Certain amino acids\nalso must be procured from food and cannot be synthesized by the body. These amino acids are the \u201cessential\u201d amino acids.\nThe human body can synthesize only 11 of the 20 required amino acids; the rest must be obtained from food. The essential\namino acids are listed in Table 25.4.\nWater-soluble Essential Vitamins\nVitamin\nFunction\nDeficiencies Can Lead To\nSources\nVitamin B1\n(Thiamine)\nNeeded by the body to process lipids,\nproteins, and carbohydrates Coenzyme\nremoves CO2 from organic compounds\nMuscle weakness, Beriberi: reduced\nheart function, CNS problems\nMilk, meat,\ndried beans,\nwhole grains\nVitamin B2\n(Riboflavin)\nTakes an active role in metabolism,\naiding in the conversion of food to energy\n(FAD and FMN)\nCracks or sores on the outer surface\nof the lips (cheliosis);

What are some of the health challenges\nposed by malnutrition? What are examples of diseases caused by nutrient deficiencies?\nFood Energy and ATP\nAnimals need food to obtain energy and maintain homeostasis. Homeostasis is the ability of a system to maintain a stable\ninternal environment even in the face of external changes to the environment. For example, the normal body temperature\nof humans is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). Humans maintain this temperature even when the external temperature is hot or cold. It takes\nenergy to maintain this body temperature, and animals obtain this energy from food.\nThe primary source of energy for animals is carbohydrates, mainly glucose. Glucose is called the body\u2019s fuel. The digestible\ncarbohydrates in an animal\u2019s diet are converted to glucose molecules through a series of catabolic chemical reactions.\nAdenosine triphosphate, or ATP, is the primary energy currency in cells; ATP stores energy in phosphate ester bonds. ATP\nreleases energy when the phosphodiester bonds are broken and ATP is converted to ADP and a phosphate group. ATP is\nproduced by the oxidative reactions in the cytoplasm and mitochondrion of the cell, where carbohydrates, proteins, and\nfats undergo a series of metabolic reactions collectively called cellular respiration. For example, glycolysis is a series of\nreactions in which glucose is converted to pyruvic acid and some of its chemical potential energy is transferred to NADH\nand ATP.\nATP is required for all cellular functions. It is used to build the organic molecules that are required for cells and tissues;\nit provides energy for muscle contraction and for the transmission of electrical signals in the nervous system. When the\namount of ATP is available in excess of the body\u2019s requirements, the liver uses the excess ATP and excess glucose to\nproduce molecules called glycogen. Glycogen is a polymeric form of glucose and is stored in the liver and skeletal muscle\ncells. When blood sugar drops, the liver releases glucose from stores of glycogen. Skeletal muscle converts glycogen to\nglucose during intense exercise. The process of converting glucose and excess ATP to glycogen and the storage of excess\nenergy is an evolutionarily important step in helping animals deal with mobility, food shortages, and famine.\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\n1079\nObesity\nObesity is a major health concern in the United States, and there is a growing focus on reducing obesity and\nthe diseases it may lead to, such as type-2 diabetes, cancers of the colon and breast, and cardiovascular\ndisease. How does the food consumed contribute to obesity?\nFatty foods are calorie-dense, meaning that they have more calories per unit mass than carbohydrates or\nproteins. One gram of carbohydrates has four calories, one gram of protein has four calories, and one gram\nof fat has nine calories. Animals tend to seek lipid-rich food for their higher energy content.\nThe signals of hunger (\u201ctime to eat\u201d) and satiety (\u201ctime to stop eating\u201d) are controlled in the hypothalamus\nregion of the brain. Foods that are rich in fatty acids tend to promote satiety more than foods that are rich\nonly in carbohydrates.\nExcess carbohydrate and ATP are used by the liver to synthesize glycogen. The pyruvate produced during\nglycolysis is used to synthesize fatty acids. When there is more glucose in the body than required, the\nresulting excess pyruvate is converted into molecules that eventually result in the synthesis of fatty acids\nwithin the body. These fatty acids are stored in adipose cells\u2014the fat cells in the mammalian body whose\nprimary role is to store fat for later use.\nIt is important to note that some animals benefit from obesity. Polar bears and seals need body fat for\ninsulation and to keep them from losing body heat during Arctic winters. When food is scarce, stored body\nfat provides energy for maintaining homeostasis. Fats prevent famine in mammals, allowing them to access\nenergy when food is not available on a daily basis; fats are stored when a large kill is made or lots of food\nis available.\nWhich of the following statements about obesity is true?\na.\nCarbohydrate-rich foods satisfy hunger better than fatty acid\u2013rich food.\nb.\nObesity is disadvantageous for organisms that live in cold climates.\nc.\nFat has more calories than protein or carbohydrates.\nd.\nIn the presence of excess blood glucose, fatty acids are synthesized and stored in skeletal muscle.\n25.3 | Digestive System Processes\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat is the process of digestion?\n\u2022\nWhat steps are involved in digestion and absorption?\n\u2022\nWhat is elimination?\n\u2022\nWhat are the roles of the small and large intestines in absorption?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nMuch of the information in this module is not within the scope of AP\u00ae. However, when we explored concepts about\nbiological molecules in the chapter on biological macromolecules, we learn how macromolecules\u2014carbohydrates, lipids,\nproteins, and nucleic acids\u2014are synthesized from monomers. During digestion, these polymers are broken down into\nmonomers, which are then absorbed and transported to all cells of the body. In the Digestive Systems module, we described\nthe fate of the ingredients of a sandwich as they pass through the digestive tract. Food is ingested through the mouth, and\ndigestion and absorption occur in a series of steps, with special enzymes playing important roles in digesting carbohydrates,\nproteins, and lipids. (You do not need to know the names of the specific enzymes involved in chemical digestion.) While\nmost absorption of nutrients takes place in the small intestine, the remaining water, some vitamins, and any leftover salts\nare absorbed in the large intestine.

For true animals, the first step is ingestion, the act of\ntaking in food. This is followed by digestion, absorption, and elimination. In the following sections, each of these steps will\nbe discussed in detail.\nIngestion\nThe large molecules found in intact food cannot pass through the cell membranes. Food needs to be broken into smaller\nparticles so that animals can harness the nutrients and organic molecules. The first step in this process is ingestion. Ingestion\nis the process of taking in food through the mouth. In vertebrates, the teeth, saliva, and tongue play important roles in\nmastication (preparing the food into bolus). While the food is being mechanically broken down, the enzymes in saliva begin\nto chemically process the food as well. The combined action of these processes modifies the food from large particles to a\nsoft mass that can be swallowed and can travel the length of the esophagus.\nDigestion and Absorption\nDigestion is the mechanical and chemical break down of food into small organic fragments. It is important to break down\nmacromolecules into smaller fragments that are of suitable size for absorption across the digestive epithelium. Large,\ncomplex molecules of proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids must be reduced to simpler particles such as simple sugar before\nthey can be absorbed by the digestive epithelial cells. Different organs play specific roles in the digestive process. The\nanimal diet needs carbohydrates, protein, and fat, as well as vitamins and inorganic components for nutritional balance.\nHow each of these components is digested is discussed in the following sections.\nCarbohydrates\nThe digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth. The salivary enzyme amylase begins the breakdown of food starches\ninto maltose, a disaccharide. As the bolus of food travels through the esophagus to the stomach, no significant digestion\nof carbohydrates takes place. The esophagus produces no digestive enzymes but does produce mucous for lubrication. The\nacidic environment in the stomach stops the action of the amylase enzyme.\nThe next step of carbohydrate digestion takes place in the duodenum. Recall that the chyme from the stomach enters the\nduodenum and mixes with the digestive secretion from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder. Pancreatic juices also contain\namylase, which continues the breakdown of starch and glycogen into maltose, a disaccharide. The disaccharides are broken\ndown into monosaccharides by enzymes called maltases, sucrases, and lactases, which are also present in the brush border\nof the small intestinal wall. Maltase breaks down maltose into glucose. Other disaccharides, such as sucrose and lactose are\nbroken down by sucrase and lactase, respectively. Sucrase breaks down sucrose (or \u201ctable sugar\u201d) into glucose and fructose,\nand lactase breaks down lactose (or \u201cmilk sugar\u201d) into glucose and galactose. The monosaccharides (glucose) thus produced\nare absorbed and then can be used in metabolic pathways to harness energy. The monosaccharides are transported across\nthe intestinal epithelium into the bloodstream to be transported to the different cells in the body. The steps in carbohydrate\ndigestion are summarized in Figure 25.17 and Table 25.5.\nFigure 25.17 Digestion of carbohydrates is performed by several enzymes. Starch and glycogen are broken down into\nglucose by amylase and maltase. Sucrose (table sugar) and lactose (milk sugar) are broken down by sucrase and\nlactase, respectively.\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\n1081\nDigestion of Carbohydrates\nEnzyme\nProduced By\nSite of\nAction\nSubstrate\nActing On\nEnd Products\nSalivary amylase\nSalivary glands\nMouth\nPolysaccharides\n(Starch)\nDisaccharides (maltose),\noligosaccharides\nPancreatic amylase Pancreas\nSmall\nintestine\nPolysaccharides\n(starch)\nDisaccharides (maltose),\nmonosaccharides\nOligosaccharidases Lining of the intestine;\nbrush border membrane\nSmall\nintestine\nDisaccharides\nMonosaccharides (e.g.,\nglucose, fructose, galactose)\nTable 25.5\nProtein\nA large part of protein digestion takes place in the stomach. The enzyme pepsin plays an important role in the digestion\nof proteins by breaking down the intact protein to peptides, which are short chains of four to nine amino acids. In the\nduodenum, other enzymes\u2014trypsin, elastase, and chymotrypsin\u2014act on the peptides reducing them to smaller peptides.\nTrypsin elastase, carboxypeptidase, and chymotrypsin are produced by the pancreas and released into the duodenum where\nthey act on the chyme. Further breakdown of peptides to single amino acids is aided by enzymes called peptidases (those\nthat break down peptides). Specifically, carboxypeptidase, dipeptidase, and aminopeptidase play important roles in\nreducing the peptides to free amino acids. The amino acids are absorbed into the bloodstream through the small intestines.\nThe steps in protein digestion are summarized in Figure 25.18 and Table 25.6.\n1082\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 25.18 Protein digestion is a multistep process that begins in the stomach and continues through the intestines.\nDigestion of Protein\nEnzyme\nProduced\nBy\nSite of\nAction\nSubstrate Acting\nOn\nEnd Products\nPepsin\nStomach chief\ncells\nStomach\nProteins\nPeptides\nTrypsin\nElastase\nChymotrypsin\nPancreas\nSmall intestine\nProteins\nPeptides\nCarboxypeptidase\nPancreas\nSmall intestine\nPeptides\nAmino acids and\npeptides\nAminopeptidase\nDipeptidase\nLining of intestine Small intestine\nPeptides\nAmino acids\nTable 25.6\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\n1083\nLipids\nLipid digestion begins in the stomach with the aid of lingual lipase and gastric lipase. However, the bulk of lipid digestion\noccurs in the small intestine due to pancreatic lipase. When chyme enters the duodenum, the hormonal responses trigger\nthe release of bile, which is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Bile aids in the digestion of lipids, primarily\ntriglycerides by emulsification. Emulsification is a process in which large lipid globules are broken down into several small\nlipid globules. These small globules are more widely distributed in the chyme rather than forming large aggregates. Lipids\nare hydrophobic substances: in the presence of water, they will aggregate to form globules to minimize exposure to water.\nBile contains bile salts, which are amphipathic, meaning they contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts. Thus, the bile\nsalts hydrophilic side can interface with water on one side and the hydrophobic side interfaces with lipids on the other. By\ndoing so, bile salts emulsify large lipid globules into small lipid globules.\nWhy is emulsification important for digestion of lipids? Pancreatic juices contain enzymes called lipases (enzymes that\nbreak down lipids). If the lipid in the chyme aggregates into large globules, very little surface area of the lipids is available\nfor the lipases to act on, leaving lipid digestion incomplete. By forming an emulsion, bile salts increase the available surface\narea of the lipids many fold. The pancreatic lipases can then act on the lipids more efficiently and digest them, as detailed in\nFigure 25.19. Lipases break down the lipids into fatty acids and glycerides. These molecules can pass through the plasma\nmembrane of the cell and enter the epithelial cells of the intestinal lining. The bile salts surround long-chain fatty acids\nand monoglycerides forming tiny spheres called micelles. The micelles move into the brush border of the small intestine\nabsorptive cells where the long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides diffuse out of the micelles into the absorptive cells\nleaving the micelles behind in the chyme. The long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides recombine in the absorptive\ncells to form triglycerides, which aggregate into globules and become coated with proteins. These large spheres are called\nchylomicrons. Chylomicrons contain triglycerides, cholesterol, and other lipids and have proteins on their surface. The\nsurface is also composed of the hydrophilic phosphate \"heads\" of phospholipids. Together, they enable the chylomicron\nto move in an aqueous environment without exposing the lipids to water. Chylomicrons leave the absorptive cells via\nexocytosis. Chylomicrons enter the lymphatic vessels, and then enter the blood in the subclavian vein.\nFigure 25.19 Lipids are digested and absorbed in the small intestine.\nVitamins\nVitamins can be either water-soluble or lipid-soluble. Fat soluble vitamins are absorbed in the same manner as lipids. It is\nimportant to consume some amount of dietary lipid to aid the absorption of lipid-soluble vitamins. Water-soluble vitamins\n1084\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\ncan be directly absorbed into the bloodstream from the intestine.\nThis website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/digest_enzymes) has an overview of the digestion of protein, fat, and\ncarbohydrates.\nWhich of the following events in digestion and absorption is incorrect?\na.\nCarbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth.\nb.\nProtein is primarily digested in the stomach.\nc.\nFats are primarily digested in the large intestine.\nd.\nDigested carbohydrate, fat, and protein molecules are absorbed by villi in the small intestine.\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\n1085\nFigure 25.20 Mechanical and chemical digestion of food takes place in many steps, beginning in the mouth and\nending in the rectum.\nWhich of the following statements about digestive processes is true?\na.\nBile emulsifies lipids in the small intestine.\nb.\nTrypsin and lipase in the stomach digest protein.\nc.\nAmylase, maltase, and lactase in the mouth digest carbohydrates.\nd.\nPeptides are primarily absorbed in the large intestines.\nElimination\nThe final step in digestion is the elimination of undigested food content and waste products. The undigested food material\nenters the colon, where most of the water is reabsorbed. Recall that the colon is also home to the microflora called \u201cintestinal\nflora\u201d that aid in the digestion process. The semi-solid waste is moved through the colon by peristaltic movements of the\nmuscle and is stored in the rectum. As the rectum expands in response to storage of fecal matter, it triggers the neural signals\nrequired to set up the urge to eliminate. The solid waste is eliminated through the anus using peristaltic movements of the\nrectum.\n1086\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nCommon Problems with Elimination\nDiarrhea and constipation are some of the most common health concerns that affect digestion. Constipation is a condition\nwhere the feces are hardened because of excess water removal in the colon. In contrast, if enough water is not removed from\nthe feces, it results in diarrhea. Many bacteria, including the ones that cause cholera, affect the proteins involved in water\nreabsorption in the colon and result in excessive diarrhea.\nEmesis\nEmesis, or vomiting, is elimination of food by forceful expulsion through the mouth. It is often in response to an irritant that\naffects the digestive tract, including but not limited to viruses, bacteria, emotions, sights, and food poisoning. This forceful\nexpulsion of the food is due to the strong contractions produced by the stomach muscles. The process of emesis is regulated\nby the medulla.\n25.4 | Digestive System Regulation\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow is neural regulation involved in the digestive processes?\n\u2022\nHow do hormones regulate digestion?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe concepts presented in this module are not within the scope for AP\u00ae other than to note that the brain houses the control\ncenter for the sensation of hunger and satiety (fullness).

In the chapter that discusses the endocrine system, we explore in detail the role of the endocrine\nsystem in maintaining homeostasis, including the normal functioning of the digestive system.\nThe brain is the control center for the sensation of hunger and satiety. The functions of the digestive system are regulated\nthrough neural and hormonal responses.\nNeural Responses to Food\nIn reaction to the smell, sight, or thought of food, like that shown in Figure 25.21, the first response is that of salivation.\nThe salivary glands secrete more saliva in response to stimulation by the autonomic nervous system triggered by the food\nin preparation for digestion.

        "summary": "Digestive system processes involve four main steps: ingestion, digestion, absorption, and elimination. Ingestion is the intake and mechanical breakdown of food in the mouth with the help of teeth, tongue, and saliva, which also begins chemical digestion of carbohydrates. Digestion continues as large macromolecules\u2014carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids\u2014are broken into smaller units by specific enzymes: carbohydrates start breaking down in the mouth and finish in the small intestine; proteins are primarily digested in the stomach and small intestine; and lipids are mainly digested in the small intestine with the aid of bile for emulsification and pancreatic lipases. Vitamins are absorbed either like lipids (if fat-soluble) or directly into the bloodstream (if water-soluble). Most nutrient absorption takes place in the small intestine, while the large intestine reabsorbs water, vitamins, and salts. Elimination removes undigested food and waste through the colon, rectum, and anus, driven by peristalsis, with common issues including diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting."

There are three overlapping phases of gastric control\u2014the cephalic phase, the gastric phase, and the intestinal\nphase\u2014each requires many enzymes and is under neural control as well.\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\n1087\nFigure 25.21 Seeing a plate of food triggers the secretion of saliva in the mouth and the production of HCL in the\nstomach. (credit: Kelly Bailey)\nDigestive Phases\nThe response to food begins even before food enters the mouth. The first phase of ingestion, called the cephalic phase, is\ncontrolled by the neural response to the stimulus provided by food. All aspects\u2014such as sight, sense, and smell\u2014trigger\nthe neural responses resulting in salivation and secretion of gastric juices. The gastric and salivary secretion in the cephalic\nphase can also take place due to the thought of food. Right now, if you think about a piece of chocolate or a crispy potato\nchip, the increase in salivation is a cephalic phase response to the thought. The central nervous system prepares the stomach\nto receive food.\nThe gastric phase begins once the food arrives in the stomach. It builds on the stimulation provided during the cephalic\nphase. Gastric acids and enzymes process the ingested materials. The gastric phase is stimulated by (1) distension of the\nstomach, (2) a decrease in the pH of the gastric contents, and (3) the presence of undigested material. This phase consists of\nlocal, hormonal, and neural responses. These responses stimulate secretions and powerful contractions.\nThe intestinal phase begins when chyme enters the small intestine triggering digestive secretions. This phase controls the\nrate of gastric emptying. In addition to gastric emptying, when chyme enters the small intestine, it triggers other hormonal\nand neural events that coordinate the activities of the intestinal tract, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder.\nHormonal Responses to Food\nThe endocrine system controls the response of the various glands in the body and the release of hormones at the appropriate\ntimes.\nOne of the important factors under hormonal control is the stomach acid environment. During the gastric phase, the hormone\ngastrin is secreted by G cells in the stomach in response to the presence of proteins. Gastrin stimulates the release of\nstomach acid, or hydrochloric acid (HCl) which aids in the digestion of the proteins. However, when the stomach is emptied,\nthe acidic environment need not be maintained and a hormone called somatostatin stops the release of hydrochloric acid.\nThis is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism.\nIn the duodenum, digestive secretions from the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder play an important role in digesting chyme\nduring the intestinal phase. In order to neutralize the acidic chyme, a hormone called secretin stimulates the pancreas\nto produce alkaline bicarbonate solution and deliver it to the duodenum. Secretin acts in tandem with another hormone\ncalled cholecystokinin (CCK). Not only does CCK stimulate the pancreas to produce the requisite pancreatic juices, it also\nstimulates the gallbladder to release bile into the duodenum.\n1088\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nVisit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/enteric_endo) to learn more about the endocrine system.

Foods high in lipids take a long time\nto digest. A hormone called gastric inhibitory peptide is secreted by the small intestine to slow down the peristaltic\nmovements of the intestine to allow fatty foods more time to be digested and absorbed.\nUnderstanding the hormonal control of the digestive system is an important area of ongoing research. Scientists are\nexploring the role of each hormone in the digestive process and developing ways to target these hormones.\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\n1089\nalimentary canal\naminopeptidase\nanus\nbile\nbolus\ncarboxypeptidase\ncarnivore\ncephalic phase\ncholecystokinin\nchylomicron\nchyme\nchymotrypsin\ndigestion\ndipeptidase\nduodenum\nelastase\nendocrine system\nesophagus\nessential nutrient\ngallbladder\ngastric inhibitory peptide\ngastric phase\ngastrin\ngastrovascular cavity\ngizzard\nherbivore\nileum\ningestion\nintestinal phase\nKEY TERMS\ntubular digestive system with a mouth and anus\nprotease that breaks down peptides to single amino acids; secreted by the brush border of small intestine\nexit point for waste material\ndigestive juice produced by the liver; important for digestion of lipids\nmass of food resulting from chewing action and wetting by saliva\nprotease that breaks down peptides to single amino acids; secreted by the brush border of the small\nintestine\nanimal that consumes animal flesh\nfirst phase of digestion, controlled by the neural response to the stimulus provided by food\nhormone that stimulates the contraction of the gallbladder to release bile\nsmall lipid globule\nmixture of partially digested food and stomach juices\npancreatic protease\nmechanical and chemical break down of food into small organic fragments\nprotease that breaks down peptides to single amino acids; secreted by the brush border of small intestine\nfirst part of the small intestine where a large part of digestion of carbohydrates and fats occurs\npancreatic protease\nsystem that controls the response of the various glands in the body and the release of hormones at the\nappropriate times\ntubular organ that connects the mouth to the stomach\nnutrient that cannot be synthesized by the body; it must be obtained from food\norgan that stores and concentrates bile\nhormone secreted by the small intestine in the presence of fatty acids and sugars; it also\ninhibits acid production and peristalsis in order to slow down the rate at which food enters the small intestine\ndigestive phase beginning once food enters the stomach; gastric acids and enzymes process the ingested\nmaterials\nhormone which stimulates hydrochloric acid secretion in the stomach\ndigestive system consisting of a single opening\nmuscular organ that grinds food\nanimal that consumes strictly plant diet\nlast part of the small intestine; connects the small intestine to the large intestine; important for absorption of B-12\nact of taking in food\nthird digestive phase; begins when chyme enters the small intestine triggering digestive secretions and\n1090\nChapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\njejunum\nlactase\nlarge intestine\nlipase\nliver\nmaltase\nmineral\nmonogastric\nomnivore\npancreas\npepsin\npepsinogen\nperistalsis\nproventriculus\nrectum\nroughage\nruminant\nsalivary amylase\nsecretin\nsmall intestine\nsomatostatin\nsphincter\nstomach\nsucrase\ntrypsin\nvilli\nvitamin\ncontrolling the rate of gastric emptying\nsecond part of the small intestine\nenzyme that breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose\ndigestive system organ that reabsorbs water from undigested material and processes waste matter\nenzyme that chemically breaks down lipids\norgan that produces bile for digestion and processes vitamins and lipids\nenzyme that breaks down maltose into glucose\ninorganic, elemental molecule that carries out important roles in the body\ndigestive system that consists of a single-chambered stomach\nanimal that consumes both plants and animals\ngland that secretes digestive juices\nenzyme found in the stomach whose main role is protein digestion\ninactive form of pepsin\nwave-like movements of muscle tissue\nglandular part of a bird\u2019s stomach\narea of the body where feces is stored until elimination\ncomponent of food that is low in energy and high in fiber\nanimal with a stomach divided into four compartments\nenzyme found in saliva, which converts carbohydrates to maltose\nhormone which stimulates sodium bicarbonate secretion in the small intestine\norgan where digestion of protein, fats, and carbohydrates is completed\nhormone released to stop acid secretion when the stomach is empty\nband of muscle that controls movement of materials throughout the digestive tract\nsaclike organ containing acidic digestive juices\nenzyme that breaks down sucrose into glucose and fructose\npancreatic protease that breaks down protein\nfolds on the inner surface of the small intestine whose role is to increase absorption area\norganic substance necessary in small amounts to sustain life",
        "summary": "Digestive system regulation involves both neural and hormonal mechanisms that coordinate the processes of digestion. The brain serves as the control center for hunger and satiety and triggers early digestive responses, such as salivation and gastric acid secretion, in reaction to the sight, smell, or thought of food (cephalic phase). Once food reaches the stomach (gastric phase), local, neural, and hormonal signals stimulate acid secretion, enzyme release, and muscle contractions, while the intestinal phase begins when chyme enters the small intestine, regulating gastric emptying and coordinating secretions from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder. Hormonal control includes gastrin, which stimulates hydrochloric acid production; somatostatin, which inhibits acid when the stomach is empty; secretin, which prompts bicarbonate release to neutralize acidic chyme; and cholecystokinin (CCK), which stimulates pancreatic enzyme secretion and bile release. Additionally, gastric inhibitory peptide slows intestinal movement to allow more time for digestion of fatty foods. These neural and hormonal responses ensure digestion proceeds efficiently and is adjusted based on the composition and presence of food."

The visual system\nis processing what is seen on the page, the motor system controls the turn of the pages (or click of the mouse), and the\nprefrontal cortex maintains attention. Even fundamental functions, like breathing and regulation of body temperature, are\ncontrolled by the nervous system. A nervous system is an organism\u2019s control center: it processes sensory information from\noutside (and inside) the body and controls all behaviors\u2014from eating to sleeping to finding a mate.\nScientists have even discovered that certain individual neurons (a type of nerve cell) can multitask. Neuroscientists often\nuse the model organism C. elegans (a worm) to study neurons. While studying these worms, it was recently discovered\nthat one type of neuron called AIY regulates both speed and direction of movement. Even though humans have billions of\nneurons compared to the 302 in C. elegans, it is thought that many perform multiple functions.\n[1] You can read more about\nthis research at the Science Daily website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32neurons) .\n1.

The nervous system, however,\nwas selected for in-depth study because an animal\u2019s ability to detect, transmit, and respond to information is critical\nfor survival. The nervous system interacts with all other organ systems to coordinate responses. The information in this\nchapter allows us to apply concepts we explored previously, including structure and function relationships, homeostasis, the\nmovement of substances across cell membranes, cell signaling and communication, and the use of ATP.\nNervous systems in animals range from relatively simple nerve nets in jellyfish to a complex brain, spinal cord, and\nperipheral nervous in humans. (For the purpose of AP\u00ae, you do not need to have detailed information about myriad types\nof nervous systems in other animals. Instead, just focus on the complex nervous system of humans.) The basic structure of\nthe nervous system that reflects function is the neuron, of which there are three types: sensory, motor, and interneuron. A\ntypical neuron consists of dendrites, a cell body, and an axon to detect, generate, transmit, and integrate signal information.\nMany neurons are surrounded by Schwann cells (a type of glial cell) that form a myelin sheath, which acts as an electrical\ninsulator, like the plastic wrap that surrounds the copper wires in a household appliance cord. The Schwann cells are\nseparated by gaps of unmyelinated fibers called nodes of Ranvier over which the nerve impulse travels as the signal passes\nalong the neuron, increasing the speed of transmission. (As we will learn in the Nervous System Disorders section, some\ndiseases of the nervous system result from the loss of myelin.) Glial cells\u2014often thought of as the \u201csupporting cast\u201d of the\nnervous system\u2014outnumber neurons and play a role in the development of neurons, buffer harmful ions and chemicals, and\nprovide myelin sheaths around neurons. Most brain tumors are caused by mutations in glial cells.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework. The AP\u00ae Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent\nfoundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP\u00ae exam\nquestions.

Some organisms, like sea sponges, lack a true nervous system. Others, like jellyfish, lack a true\nbrain and instead have a system of separate but connected nerve cells (neurons) called a \u201cnerve net.\u201d Echinoderms such as\nsea stars have nerve cells that are bundled into fibers called nerves. Flatworms of the phylum Platyhelminthes have both\na central nervous system (CNS), made up of a small \u201cbrain\u201d and two nerve cords, and a peripheral nervous system (PNS)\ncontaining a system of nerves that extend throughout the body. The insect nervous system is more complex but also fairly\ndecentralized. It contains a brain, ventral nerve cord, and ganglia (clusters of connected neurons). These ganglia can control\nmovements and behaviors without input from the brain. Octopi may have the most complicated of invertebrate nervous\nsystems\u2014they have neurons that are organized in specialized lobes and eyes that are structurally similar to vertebrate\nspecies.\nFigure 26.2 Nervous systems vary in structure and complexity. In (a) cnidarians, nerve cells form a decentralized nerve\nnet. In (b) echinoderms, nerve cells are bundled into fibers called nerves. In animals exhibiting bilateral symmetry\nsuch as (c) planarians, neurons cluster into an anterior brain that processes information. In addition to a brain, (d)\narthropods have clusters of nerve cell bodies, called peripheral ganglia, located along the ventral nerve cord. Mollusks\nsuch as squid and (e) octopi, which must hunt to survive, have complex brains containing millions of neurons. In (f)\nvertebrates, the brain and spinal cord comprise the central nervous system, while neurons extending into the rest of\nthe body comprise the peripheral nervous system. (credit e: modification of work by Michael Vecchione, Clyde F.E.\nRoper, and Michael J. Sweeney, NOAA; credit f: modification of work by NIH)\nCompared to invertebrates, vertebrate nervous systems are more complex, centralized, and specialized. While there is great\ndiversity among different vertebrate nervous systems, they all share a basic structure: a CNS that contains a brain and spinal\ncord and a PNS made up of peripheral sensory and motor nerves. One interesting difference between the nervous systems\nof invertebrates and vertebrates is that the nerve cords of many invertebrates are located ventrally whereas the vertebrate\nspinal cords are located dorsally. There is debate among evolutionary biologists as to whether these different nervous system\nplans evolved separately or whether the invertebrate body plan arrangement somehow \u201cflipped\u201d during the evolution of\nvertebrates.\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\n1109\nWatch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/vertebrate_evol) of biologist Mark Kirschner discussing the \u201cflipping\u201d\nphenomenon of vertebrate evolution.\nThe nervous system is made up of neurons, specialized cells that can receive and transmit chemical or electrical signals, and\nglia, cells that provide support functions for the neurons by playing an information processing role that is complementary\nto neurons. A neuron can be compared to an electrical wire\u2014it transmits a signal from one place to another. Glia can be\ncompared to the workers at the electric company who make sure wires go to the right places, maintain the wires, and take\ndown wires that are broken. Although glia have been compared to workers, recent evidence suggests that also usurp some\nof the signaling functions of neurons.\nThere is great diversity in the types of neurons and glia that are present in different parts of the nervous system. There are\nfour major types of neurons, and they share several important cellular components.\nNeurons\nThe nervous system of the common laboratory fly, Drosophila melanogaster, contains around 100,000 neurons, the same\nnumber as a lobster. This number compares to 75 million in the mouse and 300 million in the octopus. A human brain\ncontains around 86 billion neurons. Despite these very different numbers, the nervous systems of these animals control\nmany of the same behaviors\u2014from basic reflexes to more complicated behaviors like finding food and courting mates. The\nability of neurons to communicate with each other as well as with other types of cells underlies all of these behaviors.\nMost neurons share the same cellular components. But neurons are also highly specialized\u2014different types of neurons have\ndifferent sizes and shapes that relate to their functional roles.\nParts of a Neuron\nLike other cells, each neuron has a cell body (or soma) that contains a nucleus, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum,\nGolgi apparatus, mitochondria, and other cellular components. Neurons also contain unique structures, illustrated in Figure\n26.3 for receiving and sending the electrical signals that make neuronal communication possible. Dendrites are tree-like\nstructures that extend away from the cell body to receive messages from other neurons at specialized junctions called\nsynapses. Although some neurons do not have any dendrites, some types of neurons have multiple dendrites. Dendrites can\nhave small protrusions called dendritic spines, which further increase surface area for possible synaptic connections.\nOnce a signal is received by the dendrite, it then travels passively to the cell body. The cell body contains a specialized\nstructure, the axon hillock that integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body and\nan axon. An axon is a tube-like structure that propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings called axon terminals.\nThese terminals in turn synapse on other neurons, muscle, or target organs. Chemicals released at axon terminals allow\nsignals to be communicated to these other cells. Neurons usually have one or two axons, but some neurons, like amacrine\ncells in the retina, do not contain any axons. Some axons are covered with myelin, which acts as an insulator to minimize\ndissipation of the electrical signal as it travels down the axon, greatly increasing the speed on conduction. This insulation is\nimportant as the axon from a human motor neuron can be as long as a meter\u2014from the base of the spine to the toes. The\nmyelin sheath is not actually part of the neuron. Myelin is produced by glial cells. Along the axon there are periodic gaps in\nthe myelin sheath. These gaps are called nodes of Ranvier and are sites where the signal is \u201crecharged\u201d as it travels along\nthe axon.\nIt is important to note that a single neuron does not act alone\u2014neuronal communication depends on the connections that\nneurons make with one another (as well as with other cells, like muscle cells). Dendrites from a single neuron may receive\nsynaptic contact from many other neurons. For example, dendrites from a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum are thought to\nreceive contact from as many as 200,000 other neurons.\n1110\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 26.3 Neurons contain organelles common to many other cells, such as a nucleus and mitochondria. They\nalso have more specialized structures, including dendrites and axons.\nTypes of Neurons\nThere are different types of neurons, and the functional role of a given neuron is intimately dependent on its structure. There\nis an amazing diversity of neuron shapes and sizes found in different parts of the nervous system (and across species), as\nillustrated by the neurons shown in Figure 26.4.\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\n1111\nFigure 26.4 There is great diversity in the size and shape of neurons throughout the nervous system. Examples include\n(a) a pyramidal cell from the cerebral cortex, (b) a Purkinje cell from the cerebellar cortex, and (c) olfactory cells from\nthe olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb.\nWhile there are many defined neuron cell subtypes, neurons are broadly divided into four basic types: unipolar, bipolar,\nmultipolar, and pseudounipolar. Figure 26.5 illustrates these four basic neuron types. Unipolar neurons have only one\nstructure that extends away from the soma. These neurons are not found in vertebrates but are found in insects where they\nstimulate muscles or glands. A bipolar neuron has one axon and one dendrite extending from the soma. An example of\na bipolar neuron is a retinal bipolar cell, which receives signals from photoreceptor cells that are sensitive to light and\ntransmits these signals to ganglion cells that carry the signal to the brain. Multipolar neurons are the most common type of\nneuron. Each multipolar neuron contains one axon and multiple dendrites. Multipolar neurons can be found in the central\nnervous system (brain and spinal cord). An example of a multipolar neuron is a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum, which has\nmany branching dendrites but only one axon. Pseudounipolar cells share characteristics with both unipolar and bipolar cells.\nA pseudounipolar cell has a single process that extends from the soma, like a unipolar cell, but this process later branches\ninto two distinct structures, like a bipolar cell. Most sensory neurons are pseudounipolar and have an axon that branches\ninto two extensions: one connected to dendrites that receive sensory information and another that transmits this information\nto the spinal cord.\n1112\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 26.5 Neurons are broadly divided into four main types based on the number and placement of axons: (1)\nunipolar, (2) bipolar, (3) multipolar, and (4) pseudounipolar.\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\n1113\nNeurogenesis\nAt one time, scientists believed that people were born with all the neurons they would ever have. Research\nperformed during the last few decades indicates that neurogenesis, the birth of new neurons, continues into\nadulthood. Neurogenesis was first discovered in songbirds that produce new neurons while learning songs.\nFor mammals, new neurons also play an important role in learning: about 1000 new neurons develop in the\nhippocampus (a brain structure involved in learning and memory) each day. While most of the new neurons\nwill die, researchers found that an increase in the number of surviving new neurons in the hippocampus\ncorrelated with how well rats learned a new task. Interestingly, exercise also promotes neurogenesis in the\nhippocampus. Stress has the opposite effect. While neurogenesis is quite limited compared to regeneration\nin other tissues, research in this area may lead to new treatments for disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s, stroke,\nand epilepsy.\nHow do scientists identify new neurons? A researcher can inject a compound called bromodeoxyuridine\n(BrdU) into the brain of an animal. While all cells will be exposed to BrdU, BrdU will only be incorporated\ninto the DNA of newly generated cells that are in S phase. A technique called immunohistochemistry can\nbe used to attach a fluorescent label to the incorporated BrdU, and a researcher can use fluorescent\nmicroscopy to visualize the presence of BrdU, and thus new neurons, in brain tissue. Figure 26.6 is a\nmicrograph which shows fluorescently labeled neurons in the hippocampus of a rat.\nFigure 26.6 This micrograph shows fluorescently labeled new neurons in a rat hippocampus. Cells that are\nactively dividing have bromodoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporated into their DNA and are labeled in red. Cells that\nexpress glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) are labeled in green. Astrocytes, but not neurons, express GFAP.\nThus, cells that are labeled both red and green are actively dividing astrocytes, whereas cells labeled red only\nare actively dividing neurons.

Neurons would be unable to function without the vital roles that\nare fulfilled by these glial cells. Glia guide developing neurons to their destinations, buffer ions and chemicals that would\notherwise harm neurons, and provide myelin sheaths around axons. Scientists have recently discovered that they also play\na role in responding to nerve activity and modulating communication between nerve cells.\nTypes of Glia\nThere are several different types of glia with different functions, two of which are shown in Figure 26.7. Astrocytes, shown\nin Figure 26.8a make contact with both capillaries and neurons in the CNS. They provide nutrients and other substances\nto neurons, regulate the concentrations of ions and chemicals in the extracellular fluid, and provide structural support\nfor synapses. Astrocytes also form the blood-brain barrier\u2014a structure that blocks entrance of toxic substances into the\nbrain. Astrocytes, in particular, have been shown through calcium imaging experiments to become active in response to\nnerve activity, transmit calcium waves between astrocytes, and modulate the activity of surrounding synapses. Satellite glia\nprovide nutrients and structural support for neurons in the PNS. Microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect\nthe brain from invading microorganisms. Oligodendrocytes, shown in Figure 26.8b form myelin sheaths around axons\nin the CNS. One axon can be myelinated by several oligodendrocytes, and one oligodendrocyte can provide myelin for\nmultiple neurons. This is distinctive from the PNS where a single Schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon as the\nentire Schwann cell surrounds the axon. Radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end\ndestinations. Ependymal cells line fluid-filled ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord. They are\ninvolved in the production of cerebrospinal fluid, which serves as a cushion for the brain, moves the fluid between the spinal\ncord and the brain, and is a component for the choroid plexus.\nFigure 26.7 Glial cells support neurons and maintain their environment. Glial cells of the (a) central nervous system\ninclude oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, ependymal cells, and microglial cells. Oligodendrocytes form the myelin sheath\naround axons. Astrocytes provide nutrients to neurons, maintain their extracellular environment, and provide structural\nsupport. Microglia scavenge pathogens and dead cells. Ependymal cells produce cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the\nneurons. Glial cells of the (b) peripheral nervous system include Schwann cells, which form the myelin sheath, and\nsatellite cells, which provide nutrients and structural support to neurons.\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\n1115\nFigure 26.8 (a) Astrocytes and (b) oligodendrocytes are glial cells of the central nervous system.

While humans use words and body language to\ncommunicate, neurons use electrical and chemical signals. Just like a person in a committee, one neuron usually receives\nand synthesizes messages from multiple other neurons before \u201cmaking the decision\u201d to send the message on to other\nneurons.\nNerve Impulse Transmission within a Neuron\nFor the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive signals. These signals are possible because\neach neuron has a charged cellular membrane (a voltage difference between the inside and the outside), and the charge\nof this membrane can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules released from other neurons and environmental\nstimuli. To understand how neurons communicate, one must first understand the basis of the baseline or \u2018resting\u2019 membrane\ncharge.\nNeuronal Charged Membranes\nThe lipid bilayer membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable to charged molecules or ions. To enter or exit the\nneuron, ions must pass through special proteins called ion channels that span the membrane. Ion channels have different\nconfigurations: open, closed, and inactive, as illustrated in Figure 26.9. Some ion channels need to be activated in order\nto open and allow ions to pass into or out of the cell. These ion channels are sensitive to the environment and can change\ntheir shape accordingly. Ion channels that change their structure in response to voltage changes are called voltage-gated ion\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\n1117\nchannels. Voltage-gated ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell. The\ndifference in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called the membrane potential.\nFigure 26.9 Voltage-gated ion channels open in response to changes in membrane voltage. After activation, they\nbecome inactivated for a brief period and will no longer open in response to a signal.\nThis video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/resting_neuron) discusses the basis of the resting membrane potential.\nResting Membrane Potential\nA neuron at rest is negatively charged: the inside of a cell is approximately 70 millivolts more negative than the outside\n(\u221270 mV, note that this number varies by neuron type and by species). This voltage is called the resting membrane potential;\nit is caused by differences in the concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell. If the membrane were equally permeable\nto all ions, each type of ion would flow across the membrane and the system would reach equilibrium. Because ions cannot\nsimply cross the membrane at will, there are different concentrations of several ions inside and outside the cell, as shown in\nTable 26.1. The difference in the number of positively charged potassium ions (K+) inside and outside the cell dominates the\nresting membrane potential (Figure 26.10). When the membrane is at rest, K+ ions accumulate inside the cell due to a net\nmovement with the concentration gradient. The negative resting membrane potential is created and maintained by increasing\nthe concentration of cations outside the cell (in the extracellular fluid) relative to inside the cell (in the cytoplasm). The\nnegative charge within the cell is created by the cell membrane being more permeable to potassium ion movement than\nsodium ion movement. In neurons, potassium ions are maintained at high concentrations within the cell while sodium ions\nare maintained at high concentrations outside of the cell. The cell possesses potassium and sodium leakage channels that\nallow the two cations to diffuse down their concentration gradient. However, the neurons have far more potassium leakage\nchannels than sodium leakage channels. Therefore, potassium diffuses out of the cell at a much faster rate than sodium\nleaks in. Because more cations are leaving the cell than are entering, this causes the interior of the cell to be negatively\ncharged relative to the outside of the cell. The actions of the sodium potassium pump help to maintain the resting potential,\nonce established. Recall that sodium potassium pumps brings two K+ ions into the cell while removing three Na+ ions per\nATP consumed. As more cations are expelled from the cell than taken in, the inside of the cell remains negatively charged\nrelative to the extracellular fluid. It should be noted that chloride ions (Cl\u2013) tend to accumulate outside of the cell because\nthey are repelled by negatively-charged proteins within the cytoplasm.\n1118\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nIon Concentration Inside and Outside Neurons\nIon\nExtracellular\nconcentration (mM)\nIntracellular concentration\n(mM)\nRatio outside/\ninside\nNa+\n145\n12\n12\nK+\n4\n155\n0.026\nCl\u2212\n120\n4\n30\nOrganic anions\n(A\u2212)\n\u2014\n100\nTable 26.1 The resting membrane potential is a result of different concentrations inside and outside the\ncell.\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\n1119\nFigure 26.10 The (a) resting membrane potential is a result of different concentrations of Na+ and K+ ions inside\nand outside the cell.

At the peak action\npotential, K+ channels open and the cell becomes (c) hyperpolarized.\nAction Potential\nA neuron can receive input from other neurons and, if this input is strong enough, send the signal to downstream neurons.\nTransmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical called a neurotransmitter. Transmission of a\nsignal within a neuron (from dendrite to axon terminal) is carried by a brief reversal of the resting membrane potential\ncalled an action potential. When neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron\u2019s dendrites, ion channels\n1120\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nopen. At excitatory synapses, this opening allows positive ions to enter the neuron and results in depolarization of the\nmembrane\u2014a decrease in the difference in voltage between the inside and outside of the neuron. A stimulus from a sensory\ncell or another neuron depolarizes the target neuron to its threshold potential (-55 mV). Na+ channels in the axon hillock\nopen, allowing positive ions to enter the cell (Figure 26.10 and Figure 26.11). Once the sodium channels open, the neuron\ncompletely depolarizes to a membrane potential of about +40 mV. Action potentials are considered an \"all-or nothing\"\nevent, in that, once the threshold potential is reached, the neuron always completely depolarizes. Once depolarization is\ncomplete, the cell must now \"reset\" its membrane voltage back to the resting potential. To accomplish this, the Na+ channels\nclose and cannot be opened. This begins the neuron's refractory period, in which it cannot produce another action potential\nbecause its sodium channels will not open. At the same time, voltage-gated K+ channels open, allowing K+ to leave the cell.\nAs K+ ions leave the cell, the membrane potential once again becomes negative. The diffusion of K+ out of the cell actually\nhyperpolarizes the cell, in that the membrane potential becomes more negative than the cell's normal resting potential. At\nthis point, the sodium channels will return to their resting state, meaning they are ready to open again if the membrane\npotential again exceeds the threshold potential. Eventually the extra K+ ions diffuse out of the cell through the potassium\nleakage channels, bringing the cell from its hyperpolarized state, back to its resting membrane potential.\nFigure 26.11 The formation of an action potential can be divided into five steps: (1) A stimulus from a sensory\ncell or another neuron causes the target cell to depolarize toward the threshold potential. (2) If the threshold of\nexcitation is reached, all Na+ channels open and the membrane depolarizes. (3) At the peak action potential, K+\nchannels open and K+ begins to leave the cell. At the same time, Na+ channels close. (4) The membrane becomes\nhyperpolarized as K+ ions continue to leave the cell. The hyperpolarized membrane is in a refractory period and\ncannot fire. (5) The K+ channels close and the Na+/K+ transporter restores the resting potential.\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\n1121\nFigure 26.12 The action potential is conducted down the axon as the axon membrane depolarizes, then repolarizes.\nThis video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/actionpotential) presents an overview of action potential.\nMyelin and the Propagation of the Action Potential\nFor an action potential to communicate information to another neuron, it must travel along the axon and reach the axon\nterminals where it can initiate neurotransmitter release. The speed of conduction of an action potential along an axon is\ninfluenced by both the diameter of the axon and the axon\u2019s resistance to current leak. Myelin acts as an insulator that\nprevents current from leaving the axon; this increases the speed of action potential conduction. In demyelinating diseases\nlike multiple sclerosis, action potential conduction slows because current leaks from previously insulated axon areas. The\nnodes of Ranvier, illustrated in Figure 26.13 are gaps in the myelin sheath along the axon. These unmyelinated spaces\nare about one micrometer long and contain voltage gated Na+ and K+ channels. Flow of ions through these channels,\nparticularly the Na+ channels, regenerates the action potential over and over again along the axon. This \u2018jumping\u2019 of the\naction potential from one node to the next is called saltatory conduction. If nodes of Ranvier were not present along an\naxon, the action potential would propagate very slowly since Na+ and K+ channels would have to continuously regenerate\naction potentials at every point along the axon instead of at specific points. Nodes of Ranvier also save energy for the neuron\nsince the channels only need to be present at the nodes and not along the entire axon.\n1122\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 26.13 Nodes of Ranvier are gaps in myelin coverage along axons. Nodes contain voltage-gated K+ and Na+\nchannels. Action potentials travel down the axon by jumping from one node to the next.\nSynaptic Transmission\nThe synapse or \u201cgap\u201d is the place where information is transmitted from one neuron to another. Synapses usually form\nbetween axon terminals and dendritic spines, but this is not universally true. There are also axon-to-axon, dendrite-to-\ndendrite, and axon-to-cell body synapses. The neuron transmitting the signal is called the presynaptic neuron, and the\nneuron receiving the signal is called the postsynaptic neuron. Note that these designations are relative to a particular\nsynapse\u2014most neurons are both presynaptic and postsynaptic. There are two types of synapses: chemical and electrical.\nChemical Synapse\nWhen an action potential reaches the axon terminal it depolarizes the membrane and opens voltage-gated Na+ channels.\nNa+ ions enter the cell, further depolarizing the presynaptic membrane. This depolarization causes voltage-gated Ca2+\nchannels to open. Calcium ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that causes small membrane-bound vesicles,\ncalled synaptic vesicles, containing neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the presynaptic membrane. Synaptic vesicles\nare shown in Figure 26.14, which is an image from a scanning electron microscope.\nFigure 26.14 This pseudocolored image taken with a scanning electron microscope shows an axon terminal that was\nbroken open to reveal synaptic vesicles (blue and orange) inside the neuron. (credit: modification of work by Tina\nCarvalho, NIH-NIGMS; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nFusion of a vesicle with the presynaptic membrane causes neurotransmitter to be released into the synaptic cleft, the\nextracellular space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, as illustrated in Figure 26.15. The\nneurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptor proteins on the postsynaptic membrane.\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\n1123\nFigure 26.15 Communication at chemical synapses requires release of neurotransmitters. When the presynaptic\nmembrane is depolarized, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels open and allow Ca2+ to enter the cell. The calcium entry\ncauses synaptic vesicles to fuse with the membrane and release neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft.\nThe neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to ligand-gated ion channels in the postsynaptic\nmembrane, resulting in a localized depolarization or hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic neuron.\nThe binding of a specific neurotransmitter causes particular ion channels, in this case ligand-gated channels, on the\npostsynaptic membrane to open. Neurotransmitters can either have excitatory or inhibitory effects on the postsynaptic\nmembrane, as detailed in Table 26.1. For example, when acetylcholine is released at the synapse between a nerve and\nmuscle (called the neuromuscular junction) by a presynaptic neuron, it causes postsynaptic Na+ channels to open. Na+\nenters the postsynaptic cell and causes the postsynaptic membrane to depolarize. This depolarization is called an excitatory\npostsynaptic potential (EPSP) and makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential. Release of\nneurotransmitter at inhibitory synapses causes inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), a hyperpolarization of the\npresynaptic membrane. For example, when the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is released from a\npresynaptic neuron, it binds to and opens Cl- channels. Cl- ions enter the cell and hyperpolarizes the membrane, making the\n1124\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nneuron less likely to fire an action potential.\nOnce neurotransmission has occurred, the neurotransmitter must be removed from the synaptic cleft so the postsynaptic\nmembrane can \u201creset\u201d and be ready to receive another signal. This can be accomplished in three ways: the neurotransmitter\ncan diffuse away from the synaptic cleft, it can be degraded by enzymes in the synaptic cleft, or it can be recycled\n(sometimes called reuptake) by the presynaptic neuron. Several drugs act at this step of neurotransmission. For example,\nsome drugs that are given to Alzheimer\u2019s patients work by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that degrades\nacetylcholine. This inhibition of the enzyme essentially increases neurotransmission at synapses that release acetylcholine.\nOnce released, the acetylcholine stays in the cleft and can continually bind and unbind to postsynaptic receptors.\nNeurotransmitter Examples and Location\nNeurotransmitter\nExample\nLocation\nAcetylcholine\n\u2014\nCNS and/or PNS\nBiogenic amine\nDopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine\nCNS and/or PNS\nAmino acid\nGlycine, glutamate, aspartate, gamma aminobutyric acid CNS\nNeuropeptide\nSubstance P, endorphins\nCNS and/or PNS\nTable 26.2\nElectrical Synapse\nWhile electrical synapses are fewer in number than chemical synapses, they are found in all nervous systems and play\nimportant and unique roles. The mode of neurotransmission in electrical synapses is quite different from that in chemical\nsynapses. In an electrical synapse, the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes are very close together and are actually\nphysically connected by channel proteins forming gap junctions. Gap junctions allow current to pass directly from one cell\nto the next. In addition to the ions that carry this current, other molecules, such as ATP, can diffuse through the large gap\njunction pores.\nThere are key differences between chemical and electrical synapses. Because chemical synapses depend on the release\nof neurotransmitter molecules from synaptic vesicles to pass on their signal, there is an approximately one millisecond\ndelay between when the axon potential reaches the presynaptic terminal and when the neurotransmitter leads to opening\nof postsynaptic ion channels. Additionally, this signaling is unidirectional. Signaling in electrical synapses, in contrast,\nis virtually instantaneous (which is important for synapses involved in key reflexes), and some electrical synapses are\nbidirectional. Electrical synapses are also more reliable as they are less likely to be blocked, and they are important for\nsynchronizing the electrical activity of a group of neurons. For example, electrical synapses in the thalamus are thought to\nregulate slow-wave sleep, and disruption of these synapses can cause seizures.\nSignal Summation\nSometimes a single excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) is strong enough to induce an action potential in the\npostsynaptic neuron, but often multiple presynaptic inputs must create EPSPs around the same time for the postsynaptic\nneuron to be sufficiently depolarized to fire an action potential. This process is called summation and occurs at the axon\nhillock, as illustrated in Figure 26.16. Additionally, one neuron often has inputs from many presynaptic neurons\u2014some\nexcitatory and some inhibitory\u2014so IPSPs can cancel out EPSPs and vice versa. It is the net change in postsynaptic\nmembrane voltage that determines whether the postsynaptic cell has reached its threshold of excitation needed to fire an\naction potential. Together, synaptic summation and the threshold for excitation act as a filter so that random \u201cnoise\u201d in the\nsystem is not transmitted as important information.\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\n1125\nFigure 26.16 A single neuron can receive both excitatory and inhibitory inputs from multiple neurons, resulting in local\nmembrane depolarization (EPSP input) and hyperpolarization (IPSP input). All these inputs are added together at the\naxon hillock. If the EPSPs are strong enough to overcome the IPSPs and reach the threshold of excitation, the neuron\nwill fire.\n1126\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nBrain-computer interface\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also called Lou Gehrig\u2019s Disease) is a neurological disease\ncharacterized by the degeneration of the motor neurons that control voluntary movements. The disease\nbegins with muscle weakening and lack of coordination and eventually destroys the neurons that control\nspeech, breathing, and swallowing; in the end, the disease can lead to paralysis. At that point, patients\nrequire assistance from machines to be able to breathe and to communicate. Several special technologies\nhave been developed to allow \u201clocked-in\u201d patients to communicate with the rest of the world. One\ntechnology, for example, allows patients to type out sentences by twitching their cheek. These sentences\ncan then be read aloud by a computer.\nA relatively new line of research for helping paralyzed patients, including those with ALS, to communicate\nand retain a degree of self-sufficiency is called brain-computer interface (BCI) technology and is illustrated\nin Figure 26.17. This technology sounds like something out of science fiction: it allows paralyzed patients\nto control a computer using only their thoughts. There are several forms of BCI. Some forms use EEG\nrecordings from electrodes taped onto the skull. These recordings contain information from large\npopulations of neurons that can be decoded by a computer. Other forms of BCI require the implantation of\nan array of electrodes smaller than a postage stamp in the arm and hand area of the motor cortex. This\nform of BCI, while more invasive, is very powerful as each electrode can record actual action potentials from\none or more neurons. These signals are then sent to a computer, which has been trained to decode the\nsignal and feed it to a tool\u2014such as a cursor on a computer screen. This means that a patient with ALS can\nuse e-mail, read the Internet, and communicate with others by thinking of moving his or her hand or arm\n(even though the paralyzed patient cannot make that bodily movement). Recent advances have allowed a\nparalyzed locked-in patient who suffered a stroke 15 years ago to control a robotic arm and even to feed\nherself coffee using BCI technology.\nDespite the amazing advancements in BCI technology, it also has limitations. The technology can require\nmany hours of training and long periods of intense concentration for the patient; it can also require brain\nsurgery to implant the devices.\nFigure 26.17 With brain-computer interface technology, neural signals from a paralyzed patient are collected,\ndecoded, and then fed to a tool, such as a computer, a wheelchair, or a robotic arm.\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\n1127\nWatch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/paralyzation) in which a paralyzed woman use a brain-controlled robotic\narm to bring a drink to her mouth, among other images of brain-computer interface technology in action.\nSynaptic Plasticity\nSynapses are not static structures. They can be weakened or strengthened. They can be broken, and new synapses can be\nmade. Synaptic plasticity allows for these changes, which are all needed for a functioning nervous system. In fact, synaptic\nplasticity is the basis of learning and memory. Two processes in particular, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term\ndepression (LTD) are important forms of synaptic plasticity that occur in synapses in the hippocampus, a brain region that\nis involved in storing memories.\nLong-term Potentiation (LTP)\nLong-term potentiation (LTP) is a persistent strengthening of a synaptic connection. LTP is based on the Hebbian\nprinciple: cells that fire together wire together. There are various mechanisms, none fully understood, behind the synaptic\nstrengthening seen with LTP. One known mechanism involves a type of postsynaptic glutamate receptor, called NMDA (N-\nMethyl-D-aspartate) receptors, shown in Figure 26.18. These receptors are normally blocked by magnesium ions; however,\nwhen the postsynaptic neuron is depolarized by multiple presynaptic inputs in quick succession (either from one neuron\nor multiple neurons), the magnesium ions are forced out allowing Ca2+ ions to pass into the postsynaptic cell. Next,\nCa2+ ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that causes a different type of glutamate receptor, called AMPA\n(\u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors, to be inserted into the postsynaptic membrane, since\nactivated AMPA receptors allow positive ions to enter the cell. So, the next time glutamate is released from the presynaptic\nmembrane, it will have a larger excitatory effect (EPSP) on the postsynaptic cell because the binding of glutamate to these\nAMPA receptors will allow more positive ions into the cell. The insertion of additional AMPA receptors strengthens the\nsynapse and means that the postsynaptic neuron is more likely to fire in response to presynaptic neurotransmitter release.\nLong-term Depression (LTD)\nLong-term depression (LTD) is essentially the reverse of LTP: it is a long-term weakening of a synaptic connection.\nOne mechanism known to cause LTD also involves AMPA receptors. In this situation, calcium that enters through NMDA\nreceptors initiates a different signaling cascade, which results in the removal of AMPA receptors from the postsynaptic\nmembrane, as illustrated in Figure 26.18. The decrease in AMPA receptors in the membrane makes the postsynaptic neuron\nless responsive to glutamate released from the presynaptic neuron. While it may seem counterintuitive, LTD may be just\nas important for learning and memory as LTP. The weakening and pruning of unused synapses allows for unimportant\nconnections to be lost and makes the synapses that have undergone LTP that much stronger by comparison.\n1128\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 26.18 Calcium entry through postsynaptic NMDA receptors can initiate two different forms of synaptic plasticity:\nlong-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). LTP arises when a single synapse is repeatedly\nstimulated. This stimulation causes a calcium- and CaMKII-dependent cellular cascade, which results in the insertion of\nmore AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. The next time glutamate is released from the presynaptic cell,\nit will bind to both NMDA and the newly inserted AMPA receptors, thus depolarizing the membrane more efficiently. LTD\noccurs when few glutamate molecules bind to NMDA receptors at a synapse (due to a low firing rate of the presynaptic\nneuron). The calcium that does flow through NMDA receptors initiates a different calcineurin and protein phosphatase\n1-dependent cascade, which results in the endocytosis of AMPA receptors. This makes the postsynaptic neuron less\nresponsive to glutamate released from the presynaptic neuron.\nActivity\nDon\u2019t Eat the Fugu: Understanding the Neuron.

The outermost layer is the dura mater (Latin for \u201chard mother\u201d). As the Latin suggests, the primary function\nfor this thick layer is to protect the brain and spinal cord. The dura mater also contains vein-like structures that carry blood\nfrom the brain back to the heart. The middle layer is the web-like arachnoid mater. The last layer is the pia mater (Latin\nfor \u201csoft mother\u201d), which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord like plastic wrap. The space between the\narachnoid and pia maters is filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is produced by a tissue called choroid plexus in\nfluid-filled compartments in the CNS called ventricles. The brain floats in CSF, which acts as a cushion and shock absorber\nand makes the brain neutrally buoyant. CSF also functions to circulate chemical substances throughout the brain and into\nthe spinal cord.\nThe entire brain contains only about 8.5 tablespoons of CSF, but CSF is constantly produced in the ventricles. This creates\na problem when a ventricle is blocked\u2014the CSF builds up and creates swelling and the brain is pushed against the skull.\nThis swelling condition is called hydrocephalus (\u201cwater head\u201d) and can cause seizures, cognitive problems, and even death\nif a shunt is not inserted to remove the fluid and pressure.\nFigure 26.19 The cerebral cortex is covered by three layers of meninges: the dura, arachnoid, and pia maters. (credit:\nmodification of work by Gray\u2019s Anatomy)\nBrain\nThe brain is the part of the central nervous system that is contained in the cranial cavity of the skull. It includes the cerebral\ncortex, limbic system, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. There are three different ways that a brain\ncan be sectioned in order to view internal structures: a sagittal section cuts the brain left to right, as shown in Figure 26.21b,\na coronal section cuts the brain front to back, as shown in Figure 26.20a, and a horizontal section cuts the brain top to\nbottom.\nCerebral Cortex\nThe outermost part of the brain is a thick piece of nervous system tissue called the cerebral cortex, which is folded into hills\ncalled gyri (singular: gyrus) and valleys called sulci (singular: sulcus). The cortex is made up of two hemispheres\u2014right\nand left\u2014which are separated by a large sulcus. A thick fiber bundle called the corpus callosum (Latin: \u201ctough body\u201d)\nconnects the two hemispheres and allows information to be passed from one side to the other. Although there are some\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\n1131\nbrain functions that are localized more to one hemisphere than the other, the functions of the two hemispheres are largely\nredundant. In fact, sometimes (very rarely) an entire hemisphere is removed to treat severe epilepsy. While patients do suffer\nsome deficits following the surgery, they can have surprisingly few problems, especially when the surgery is performed on\nchildren who have very immature nervous systems.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 26.20 These illustrations show the (a) coronal and (b) sagittal sections of the human brain.\nIn other surgeries to treat severe epilepsy, the corpus callosum is cut instead of removing an entire hemisphere. This causes\na condition called split-brain, which gives insights into unique functions of the two hemispheres. For example, when an\nobject is presented to patients\u2019 left visual field, they may be unable to verbally name the object (and may claim to not have\nseen an object at all). This is because the visual input from the left visual field crosses and enters the right hemisphere and\ncannot then signal to the speech center, which generally is found in the left side of the brain. Remarkably, if a split-brain\npatient is asked to pick up a specific object out of a group of objects with the left hand, the patient will be able to do so but\nwill still be unable to vocally identify it.\nSee this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/split-brain) to learn more about split-brain patients and to play a game\nwhere you can model the split-brain experiments yourself.\nEach cortical hemisphere contains regions called lobes that are involved in different functions. Scientists use various\ntechniques to determine what brain areas are involved in different functions: they examine patients who have had injuries or\ndiseases that affect specific areas and see how those areas are related to functional deficits. They also conduct animal studies\nwhere they stimulate brain areas and see if there are any behavioral changes. They use a technique called transmagnetic\nstimulation (TMS) to temporarily deactivate specific parts of the cortex using strong magnets placed outside the head;\nand they use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at changes in oxygenated blood flow in particular\nbrain regions that correlate with specific behavioral tasks. These techniques, and others, have given great insight into the\nfunctions of different brain regions but have also showed that any given brain area can be involved in more than one\nbehavior or process, and any given behavior or process generally involves neurons in multiple brain areas. That being said,\neach hemisphere of the mammalian cerebral cortex can be broken down into four functionally and spatially defined lobes:\nfrontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. Figure 26.21 illustrates these four lobes of the human cerebral cortex.\n1132\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 26.21 The human cerebral cortex includes the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes.\nThe frontal lobe is located at the front of the brain, over the eyes. This lobe contains the olfactory bulb, which processes\nsmells. The frontal lobe also contains the motor cortex, which is important for planning and implementing movement.\nAreas within the motor cortex map to different muscle groups, and there is some organization to this map, as shown in\nFigure 26.22. For example, the neurons that control movement of the fingers are next to the neurons that control movement\nof the hand. Neurons in the frontal lobe also control cognitive functions like maintaining attention, speech, and decision-\nmaking. Studies of humans who have damaged their frontal lobes show that parts of this area are involved in personality,\nsocialization, and assessing risk.\nFigure 26.22 Different parts of the motor cortex control different muscle groups. Muscle groups that are neighbors in\nthe body are generally controlled by neighboring regions of the motor cortex as well. For example, the neurons that\ncontrol finger movement are near the neurons that control hand movement.\nThe parietal lobe is located at the top of the brain. Neurons in the parietal lobe are involved in speech and also reading.\nTwo of the parietal lobe\u2019s main functions are processing somatosensation\u2014touch sensations like pressure, pain, heat,\ncold\u2014and processing proprioception\u2014the sense of how parts of the body are oriented in space. The parietal lobe contains\na somatosensory map of the body similar to the motor cortex.\nThe occipital lobe is located at the back of the brain. It is primarily involved in vision\u2014seeing, recognizing, and identifying\nthe visual world.\nThe temporal lobe is located at the base of the brain by your ears and is primarily involved in processing and interpreting\nsounds. It also contains the hippocampus (Greek for \u201cseahorse\u201d)\u2014a structure that processes memory formation. The\nhippocampus is illustrated in Figure 26.24. The role of the hippocampus in memory was partially determined by studying\none famous epileptic patient, HM, who had both sides of his hippocampus removed in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. His\nseizures went away, but he could no longer form new memories (although he could remember some facts from before his\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\n1133\nsurgery and could learn new motor tasks).\nCerebral Cortex\nCompared to other vertebrates, mammals have exceptionally large brains for their body size. An entire\nalligator\u2019s brain, for example, would fill about one and a half teaspoons. This increase in brain to body\nsize ratio is especially pronounced in apes, whales, and dolphins. While this increase in overall brain size\ndoubtlessly played a role in the evolution of complex behaviors unique to mammals, it does not tell the\nwhole story. Scientists have found a relationship between the relatively high surface area of the cortex and\nthe intelligence and complex social behaviors exhibited by some mammals. This increased surface area is\ndue, in part, to increased folding of the cortical sheet (more sulci and gyri). For example, a rat cortex is very\nsmooth with very few sulci and gyri. Cat and sheep cortices have more sulci and gyri. Chimps, humans, and\ndolphins have even more.\nFigure 26.23 Mammals have larger brain-to-body ratios than other vertebrates. Within mammals, increased\ncortical folding and surface area is correlated with complex behavior.\nBasal Ganglia\nInterconnected brain areas called the basal ganglia (or basal nuclei), shown in Figure 26.20b, play important roles in\nmovement control and posture. Damage to the basal ganglia, as in Parkinson\u2019s disease, leads to motor impairments like a\nshuffling gait when walking. The basal ganglia also regulate motivation. For example, when a wasp sting led to bilateral\nbasal ganglia damage in a 25-year-old businessman, he began to spend all his days in bed and showed no interest in anything\nor anybody. But when he was externally stimulated\u2014as when someone asked to play a card game with him\u2014he was able\nto function normally. Interestingly, he and other similar patients do not report feeling bored or frustrated by their state.\nThalamus\nThe thalamus (Greek for \u201cinner chamber\u201d), illustrated in Figure 26.24, acts as a gateway to and from the cortex. It receives\nsensory and motor inputs from the body and also receives feedback from the cortex. This feedback mechanism can modulate\nconscious awareness of sensory and motor inputs depending on the attention and arousal state of the animal. The thalamus\nhelps regulate consciousness, arousal, and sleep states. A rare genetic disorder called fatal familial insomnia causes the\ndegeneration of thalamic neurons and glia. This disorder prevents affected patients from being able to sleep, among other\nsymptoms, and is eventually fatal.\n1134\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 26.24 The limbic system regulates emotion and other behaviors. It includes parts of the cerebral cortex located\nnear the center of the brain, including the cingulate gyrus and the hippocampus as well as the thalamus, hypothalamus\nand amygdala.\nHypothalamus\nBelow the thalamus is the hypothalamus, shown in Figure 26.24. The hypothalamus controls the endocrine system by\nsending signals to the pituitary gland, a pea-sized endocrine gland that releases several different hormones that affect other\nglands as well as other cells. This relationship means that the hypothalamus regulates important behaviors that are controlled\nby these hormones. The hypothalamus is the body\u2019s thermostat\u2014it makes sure key functions like food and water intake,\nenergy expenditure, and body temperature are kept at appropriate levels. Neurons within the hypothalamus also regulate\ncircadian rhythms, sometimes called sleep cycles.\nLimbic System\nThe limbic system is a connected set of structures that regulates emotion, as well as behaviors related to fear and motivation.\nIt plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus.\nOne important structure within the limbic system is a temporal lobe structure called the amygdala (Greek for \u201calmond\u201d),\nillustrated in Figure 26.24. The two amygdala are important both for the sensation of fear and for recognizing fearful faces.\nThe cingulate gyrus helps regulate emotions and pain.\nCerebellum\nThe cerebellum (Latin for \u201clittle brain\u201d), shown in Figure 26.21, sits at the base of the brain on top of the brainstem. The\ncerebellum controls balance and aids in coordinating movement and learning new motor tasks.\nBrainstem\nThe brainstem, illustrated in Figure 26.21, connects the rest of the brain with the spinal cord. It consists of the midbrain,\nmedulla oblongata, and the pons. Motor and sensory neurons extend through the brainstem allowing for the relay of signals\nbetween the brain and spinal cord. Ascending neural pathways cross in this section of the brain allowing the left hemisphere\nof the cerebrum to control the right side of the body and vice versa. The brainstem coordinates motor control signals sent\nfrom the brain to the body. The brainstem controls several important functions of the body including alertness, arousal,\nbreathing, blood pressure, digestion, heart rate, swallowing, walking, and sensory and motor information integration.\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\n1135\nActivity\nCreate a representation to illustrate what parts of the brain allow you to perform a favorite daily activity, like\nkicking a soccer ball, learning a new dance move, or reading the information in this section of the text and\njotting down a few notes.\nSpinal Cord\nConnecting to the brainstem and extending down the body through the spinal column is the spinal cord, shown in Figure\n26.21. The spinal cord is a thick bundle of nerve tissue that carries information about the body to the brain and from the\nbrain to the body. The spinal cord is contained within the bones of the vertebrate column but is able to communicate signals\nto and from the body through its connections with spinal nerves (part of the peripheral nervous system). A cross-section of\nthe spinal cord looks like a white oval containing a gray butterfly-shape, as illustrated in Figure 26.25. Myelinated axons\nmake up the \u201cwhite matter\u201d and neuron and glial cell bodies make up the \u201cgray matter.\u201d Gray matter is also composed of\ninterneurons, which connect two neurons each located in different parts of the body. Axons and cell bodies in the dorsal\n(facing the back of the animal) spinal cord convey mostly sensory information from the body to the brain. Axons and cell\nbodies in the ventral (facing the front of the animal) spinal cord primarily transmit signals controlling movement from the\nbrain to the body.\nThe spinal cord also controls motor reflexes. These reflexes are quick, unconscious movements\u2014like automatically\nremoving a hand from a hot object. Reflexes are so fast because they involve local synaptic connections. For example, the\nknee reflex that a doctor tests during a routine physical is controlled by a single synapse between a sensory neuron and a\nmotor neuron. While a reflex may only require the involvement of one or two synapses, synapses with interneurons in the\nspinal column transmit information to the brain to convey what happened (the knee jerked, or the hand was hot).\nIn the United States, there around 10,000 spinal cord injuries each year. Because the spinal cord is the information\nsuperhighway connecting the brain with the body, damage to the spinal cord can lead to paralysis. The extent of the\nparalysis depends on the location of the injury along the spinal cord and whether the spinal cord was completely severed.\nFor example, if the spinal cord is damaged at the level of the neck, it can cause paralysis from the neck down, whereas\ndamage to the spinal column further down may limit paralysis to the legs. Spinal cord injuries are notoriously difficult to\ntreat because spinal nerves do not regenerate, although ongoing research suggests that stem cell transplants may be able to\nact as a bridge to reconnect severed nerves. Researchers are also looking at ways to prevent the inflammation that worsens\nnerve damage after injury. One such treatment is to pump the body with cold saline to induce hypothermia. This cooling\ncan prevent swelling and other processes that are thought to worsen spinal cord injuries.\nFigure 26.25 A cross-section of the spinal cord shows gray matter (containing cell bodies and interneurons) and white\nmatter (containing axons).\n1136\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\n26.4 | The Peripheral Nervous System\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the organization and functions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems?\n\u2022\nWhat is the organization and function of the sensory-somatic nervous system?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe information about the peripheral nervous system is not within the scope of AP\u00ae. However, it is important to note that\nthe peripheral nervous system (PNS) is the connection between the central nervous system and the rest of the body. The\nPNS can be broken down into the autonomic nervous system, which controls bodily functions without conscious control,\nand the sensory-somatic nervous system, which transmits sensory information from the skin, muscles, and sensory organs\nto the CNS and motor commands from the CNS to the muscles.

        "summary": "The central nervous system (CNS), composed of the brain and spinal cord and protected by the skull, vertebral column, and three meninges (dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater), integrates sensory input and directs motor responses. The brain, which consumes about 20% of the body\u2019s energy, includes the cerebral cortex (divided into frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes with specialized sensory, motor, cognitive, and memory-related functions), basal ganglia (movement control and motivation), thalamus (sensory/motor relay and regulation of consciousness), hypothalamus (endocrine control, homeostasis, circadian rhythms), limbic system (emotion, fear, memory), cerebellum (balance, motor coordination), and brainstem (relay between brain and spinal cord, control of vital functions). The spinal cord transmits information between brain and body, processes reflexes, and contains white and gray matter for sensory and motor pathways; damage can cause paralysis, with severity depending on injury location. Cerebrospinal fluid cushions the CNS, circulates chemicals, and maintains buoyancy, with blockages leading to hydrocephalus."

The postganglionic neuron, in turn, acts on a target organ. Autonomic\nresponses are mediated by the sympathetic and the parasympathetic systems, which are antagonistic to one\nanother. The sympathetic system activates the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response, while the parasympathetic system\nactivates the \u201crest and digest\u201d response.\nWhich of the following statements about the autonomic nervous system is true?\na.\nThe sympathetic pathway is responsible for resting the body, whereas the parasympathetic pathway is\nresponsible for preparing for an emergency.\nb.\nMost preganglionic neurons in the sympathetic pathway originate in the spinal cord.\nc.\nSlowing of the heartbeat is a sympathetic response.\nd.\nParasympathetic neurons are responsible for releasing norepinephrine on the target organ, whereas\nsympathetic neurons are responsible for releasing acetylcholine.\n1138\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nThe autonomic nervous system serves as the relay between the CNS and the internal organs. It controls the lungs, the heart,\nsmooth muscle, and exocrine and endocrine glands. The autonomic nervous system controls these organs largely without\nconscious control; it can continuously monitor the conditions of these different systems and implement changes as needed.\nSignaling to the target tissue usually involves two synapses: a preganglionic neuron (originating in the CNS) synapses to a\nneuron in a ganglion that, in turn, synapses on the target organ, as illustrated in Figure 26.26. There are two divisions of\nthe autonomic nervous system that often have opposing effects: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic\nnervous system.\nSympathetic Nervous System\nThe sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response that occurs when an animal encounters\na dangerous situation. One way to remember this is to think of the surprise a person feels when encountering a snake\n(\u201csnake\u201d and \u201csympathetic\u201d both begin with \u201cs\u201d). Examples of functions controlled by the sympathetic nervous system\ninclude an accelerated heart rate and inhibited digestion. These functions help prepare an organism\u2019s body for the physical\nstrain required to escape a potentially dangerous situation or to fend off a predator.\nFigure 26.27 The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems often have opposing effects on target organs.\nMost preganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system originate in the spinal cord, as illustrated in Figure 26.27.\nThe axons of these neurons release acetylcholine on postganglionic neurons within sympathetic ganglia (the sympathetic\nganglia form a chain that extends alongside the spinal cord). The acetylcholine activates the postganglionic neurons.\nPostganglionic neurons then release norepinephrine onto target organs. As anyone who has ever felt a rush before a\nbig test, speech, or athletic event can attest, the effects of the sympathetic nervous system are quite pervasive. This is\nboth because one preganglionic neuron synapses on multiple postganglionic neurons, amplifying the effect of the original\nsynapse, and because the adrenal gland also releases norepinephrine (and the closely related hormone epinephrine) into the\nblood stream. The physiological effects of this norepinephrine release include dilating the trachea and bronchi (making it\neasier for the animal to breathe), increasing heart rate, and moving blood from the skin to the heart, muscles, and brain (so\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\n1139\nthe animal can think and run). The strength and speed of the sympathetic response helps an organism avoid danger, and\nscientists have found evidence that it may also increase LTP\u2014allowing the animal to remember the dangerous situation and\navoid it in the future.\nParasympathetic Nervous System\nWhile the sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations, the parasympathetic nervous system allows\nan animal to \u201crest and digest.\u201d One way to remember this is to think that during a restful situation like a picnic, the\nparasympathetic nervous system is in control (\u201cpicnic\u201d and \u201cparasympathetic\u201d both start with \u201cp\u201d). Parasympathetic\npreganglionic neurons have cell bodies located in the brainstem and in the sacral (toward the bottom) spinal cord, as shown\nin Figure 26.27. The axons of the preganglionic neurons release acetylcholine on the postganglionic neurons, which are\ngenerally located very near the target organs. Most postganglionic neurons release acetylcholine onto target organs, although\nsome release nitric oxide.\nThe parasympathetic nervous system resets organ function after the sympathetic nervous system is activated (the common\nadrenaline dump you feel after a \u2018fight-or-flight\u2019 event). Effects of acetylcholine release on target organs include slowing of\nheart rate, lowered blood pressure, and stimulation of digestion.\nSensory-Somatic Nervous System\nThe sensory-somatic nervous system is made up of cranial and spinal nerves and contains both sensory and motor neurons.\nSensory neurons transmit sensory information from the skin, skeletal muscle, and sensory organs to the CNS. Motor neurons\ntransmit messages about desired movement from the CNS to the muscles to make them contract. Without its sensory-\nsomatic nervous system, an animal would be unable to process any information about its environment (what it sees, feels,\nhears, and so on) and could not control motor movements. Unlike the autonomic nervous system, which has two synapses\nbetween the CNS and the target organ, sensory and motor neurons have only one synapse\u2014one ending of the neuron is\nat the organ and the other directly contacts a CNS neuron. Acetylcholine is the main neurotransmitter released at these\nsynapses.\nHumans have 12 cranial nerves, nerves that emerge from or enter the skull (cranium), as opposed to the spinal nerves,\nwhich emerge from the vertebral column. Each cranial nerve is accorded a name, which are detailed in Figure 26.28. Some\ncranial nerves transmit only sensory information. For example, the olfactory nerve transmits information about smells from\nthe nose to the brainstem. Other cranial nerves transmit almost solely motor information. For example, the oculomotor nerve\ncontrols the opening and closing of the eyelid and some eye movements. Other cranial nerves contain a mix of sensory and\nmotor fibers. For example, the glossopharyngeal nerve has a role in both taste (sensory) and swallowing (motor).\n1140\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 26.28 The human brain contains 12 cranial nerves that receive sensory input and control motor output for the\nhead and neck.\nSpinal nerves transmit sensory and motor information between the spinal cord and the rest of the body. Each of the 31\nspinal nerves (in humans) contains both sensory and motor axons. The sensory neuron cell bodies are grouped in structures\ncalled dorsal root ganglia and are shown in Figure 26.29. Each sensory neuron has one projection\u2014with a sensory receptor\nending in skin, muscle, or sensory organs\u2014and another that synapses with a neuron in the dorsal spinal cord. Motor neurons\nhave cell bodies in the ventral gray matter of the spinal cord that project to muscle through the ventral root. These neurons\nare usually stimulated by interneurons within the spinal cord but are sometimes directly stimulated by sensory neurons.\nFigure 26.29 Spinal nerves contain both sensory and motor axons. The somas of sensory neurons are located in\ndorsal root ganglia. The somas of motor neurons are found in the ventral portion of the gray matter of the spinal cord.\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\n1141\n26.5 | Nervous System Disorders\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are examples of symptoms, causes, and treatments for several examples of nervous system disorders?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nInformation about disorders of the nervous system is out of scope for AP\u00ae.

While scientists have discovered\npotential causes of many of these diseases, and viable treatments for some, ongoing research seeks to find ways to better\nprevent and treat all of these disorders.\nNeurodegenerative Disorders\nNeurodegenerative disorders are illnesses characterized by a loss of nervous system functioning that are usually caused\nby neuronal death. These diseases generally worsen over time as more and more neurons die. The symptoms of a particular\nneurodegenerative disease are related to where in the nervous system the death of neurons occurs. Spinocerebellar ataxia,\nfor example, leads to neuronal death in the cerebellum. The death of these neurons causes problems in balance and walking.\nNeurodegenerative disorders include Huntington\u2019s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other\ntypes of dementia disorders, and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Here, Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease will be discussed in more\ndepth.\nAlzheimer\u2019s Disease\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. In 2012, an estimated 5.4 million Americans\nsuffered from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and payments for their care are estimated at $200 billion. Roughly one in every eight\npeople age 65 or older has the disease. Due to the aging of the baby-boomer generation, there are projected to be as many\nas 13 million Alzheimer\u2019s patients in the United States in the year 2050.\nSymptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease include disruptive memory loss, confusion about time or place, difficulty planning\nor executing tasks, poor judgment, and personality changes. Problems smelling certain scents can also be indicative of\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease and may serve as an early warning sign. Many of these symptoms are also common in people who\nare aging normally, so it is the severity and longevity of the symptoms that determine whether a person is suffering from\nAlzheimer\u2019s.\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease was named for Alois Alzheimer, a German psychiatrist who published a report in 1911 about a woman\nwho showed severe dementia symptoms. Along with his colleagues, he examined the woman\u2019s brain following her death\nand reported the presence of abnormal clumps, which are now called amyloid plaques, along with tangled brain fibers called\nneurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and an overall shrinking of brain volume are commonly\nseen in the brains of Alzheimer\u2019s patients. Loss of neurons in the hippocampus is especially severe in advanced Alzheimer\u2019s\npatients. Figure 26.30 compares a normal brain to the brain of an Alzheimer\u2019s patient. Many research groups are examining\nthe causes of these hallmarks of the disease.\nOne form of the disease is usually caused by mutations in one of three known genes. This rare form of early onset\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease affects fewer than five percent of patients with the disease and causes dementia beginning between the\nages of 30 and 60. The more prevalent, late-onset form of the disease likely also has a genetic component.

Problems smelling certain scents can also be indicative of\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease and may serve as an early warning sign. Many of these symptoms are also common in people who\nare aging normally, so it is the severity and longevity of the symptoms that determine whether a person is suffering from\nAlzheimer\u2019s.\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease was named for Alois Alzheimer, a German psychiatrist who published a report in 1911 about a woman\nwho showed severe dementia symptoms. Along with his colleagues, he examined the woman\u2019s brain following her death\nand reported the presence of abnormal clumps, which are now called amyloid plaques, along with tangled brain fibers called\nneurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and an overall shrinking of brain volume are commonly\nseen in the brains of Alzheimer\u2019s patients. Loss of neurons in the hippocampus is especially severe in advanced Alzheimer\u2019s\npatients. Figure 26.30 compares a normal brain to the brain of an Alzheimer\u2019s patient. Many research groups are examining\nthe causes of these hallmarks of the disease.\nOne form of the disease is usually caused by mutations in one of three known genes. This rare form of early onset\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease affects fewer than five percent of patients with the disease and causes dementia beginning between the\nages of 30 and 60. The more prevalent, late-onset form of the disease likely also has a genetic component. One particular\n1142\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\ngene, apolipoprotein E (APOE) has a variant (E4) that increases a carrier\u2019s likelihood of getting the disease. Many other\ngenes have been identified that might be involved in the pathology.\nVisit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/alzheimers) for video links discussing genetics and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nWhat statement about risk genes in Alzheimer\u2019s disease is true?\na.\nRisk genes do not guarantee that a person will get Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nb.\nRisk genes account for <5% of Alzheimer\u2019s cases.\nc.\nRisk genes directly cause a disease.\nd.\nIndividuals with risk genes have symptoms that develop when an individual is in their 40s or 50s.\nUnfortunately, there is no cure for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Current treatments focus on managing the symptoms of the disease.\nBecause decrease in the activity of cholinergic neurons (neurons that use the neurotransmitter acetylcholine) is common in\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease, several drugs used to treat the disease work by increasing acetylcholine neurotransmission, often by\ninhibiting the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft. Other clinical interventions focus on behavioral\ntherapies like psychotherapy, sensory therapy, and cognitive exercises. Since Alzheimer\u2019s disease appears to hijack the\nnormal aging process, research into prevention is prevalent. Smoking, obesity, and cardiovascular problems may be risk\nfactors for the disease, so treatments for those may also help to prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Some studies have shown that\npeople who remain intellectually active by playing games, reading, playing musical instruments, and being socially active\nin later life have a reduced risk of developing the disease.\nFigure 26.30 Compared to a normal brain (left), the brain from a patient with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (right) shows\na dramatic neurodegeneration, particularly within the ventricles and hippocampus.

It was first characterized by James\nParkinson in 1817. Each year, 50,000-60,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with the disease. Parkinson\u2019s disease\ncauses the loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, a midbrain structure that regulates movement. Loss of these\nneurons causes many symptoms including tremor (shaking of fingers or a limb), slowed movement, speech changes, balance\nand posture problems, and rigid muscles. The combination of these symptoms often causes a characteristic slow hunched\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\n1143\nshuffling walk, illustrated in Figure 26.31. Patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease can also exhibit psychological symptoms, such\nas dementia or emotional problems.\nAlthough some patients have a form of the disease known to be caused by a single mutation, for most patients the exact\ncauses of Parkinson\u2019s disease remain unknown: the disease likely results from a combination of genetic and environmental\nfactors (similar to Alzheimer\u2019s disease). Post-mortem analysis of brains from Parkinson\u2019s patients shows the presence of\nLewy bodies\u2014abnormal protein clumps\u2014in dopaminergic neurons. The prevalence of these Lewy bodies often correlates\nwith the severity of the disease.\nThere is no cure for Parkinson\u2019s disease, and treatment is focused on easing symptoms. One of the most commonly\nprescribed drugs for Parkinson\u2019s is L-DOPA, which is a chemical that is converted into dopamine by neurons in the\nbrain. This conversion increases the overall level of dopamine neurotransmission and can help compensate for the loss of\ndopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Other drugs work by inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down dopamine.\nFigure 26.31 Parkinson\u2019s patients often have a characteristic hunched walk.\n1144\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 26.32 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, is a rapidly progressing\ndisease that attacks the neurons that control voluntary muscles.

There are several different\nclasses of neurodevelopmental disorders. Some, like Down Syndrome, cause intellectual deficits. Others specifically\naffect communication, learning, or the motor system. Some disorders like autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder have complex symptoms.\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\n1145\nAutism\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder. Its severity differs from person to person. Estimates\nfor the prevalence of the disorder have changed rapidly in the past few decades. Current estimates suggest that one in 88\nchildren will develop the disorder. ASD is four times more prevalent in males than females.\nThis video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/autism) discusses possible reasons why there has been a recent increase in the\nnumber of people diagnosed with autism.\nWhich of the following is a partial explanation of the increase in autism spectrum disorder diagnosis between 1992\nand 2005?\na.\ndiagnostic criteria changed\nb.\nincreased vaccination rates\nc.\nmore young parents reproducing\nd.\ndecreased ascertainment across classes\nA characteristic symptom of ASD is impaired social skills. Children with autism may have difficulty making and\nmaintaining eye contact and reading social cues. They also may have problems feeling empathy for others. Other symptoms\nof ASD include repetitive motor behaviors (such as rocking back and forth), preoccupation with specific subjects, strict\nadherence to certain rituals, and unusual language use. Up to 30 percent of patients with ASD develop epilepsy, and patients\nwith some forms of the disorder (like Fragile X) also have intellectual disability. Because it is a spectrum disorder, other\nASD patients are very functional and have good-to-excellent language skills. Many of these patients do not feel that they\nsuffer from a disorder and instead think that their brains just process information differently.\nExcept for some well-characterized, clearly genetic forms of autism (like Fragile X and Rett\u2019s Syndrome), the causes of\nASD are largely unknown. Variants of several genes correlate with the presence of ASD, but for any given patient, many\ndifferent mutations in different genes may be required for the disease to develop. At a general level, ASD is thought to be a\ndisease of \u201cincorrect\u201d wiring. Accordingly, brains of some ASD patients lack the same level of synaptic pruning that occurs\nin non-affected people. In the 1990s, a research paper linked autism to a common vaccine given to children. This paper\nwas retracted when it was discovered that the author falsified data, and follow-up studies showed no connection between\nvaccines and autism.\nTreatment for autism usually combines behavioral therapies and interventions, along with medications to treat other\ndisorders common to people with autism (depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder). Although early interventions\ncan help mitigate the effects of the disease, there is currently no cure for ASD.\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\nApproximately three to five percent of children and adults are affected by attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder\n(ADHD). Like ASD, ADHD is more prevalent in males than females. Symptoms of the disorder include inattention (lack\nof focus), executive functioning difficulties, impulsivity, and hyperactivity beyond what is characteristic of the normal\ndevelopmental stage. Some patients do not have the hyperactive component of symptoms and are diagnosed with a\nsubtype of ADHD: attention deficit disorder (ADD). Many people with ADHD also show comorbitity, in that they develop\nsecondary disorders in addition to ADHD. Examples include depression or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Figure\n26.33 provides some statistics concerning comorbidity with ADHD.\nThe cause of ADHD is unknown, although research points to a delay and dysfunction in the development of the prefrontal\ncortex and disturbances in neurotransmission. According to studies of twins, the disorder has a strong genetic component.\nThere are several candidate genes that may contribute to the disorder, but no definitive links have been discovered.\nEnvironmental factors, including exposure to certain pesticides, may also contribute to the development of ADHD in some\n1146\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\npatients. Treatment for ADHD often involves behavioral therapies and the prescription of stimulant medications, which\nparadoxically cause a calming effect in these patients.\nFigure 26.33 Many people with ADHD have one or more other neurological disorders. (credit \u201cchart design and\nillustration\u201d: modification of work by Leigh Coriale; credit \u201cdata\u201d: Drs. Biederman and Faraone, Massachusetts General\nHospital).\nNeurologist\nNeurologists are physicians who specialize in disorders of the nervous system. They diagnose and treat\ndisorders such as epilepsy, stroke, dementia, nervous system injuries, Parkinson\u2019s disease, sleep disorders,\nand multiple sclerosis. Neurologists are medical doctors who have attended college, medical school, and\ncompleted three to four years of neurology residency.\nWhen examining a new patient, a neurologist takes a full medical history and performs a complete physical\nexam. The physical exam contains specific tasks that are used to determine what areas of the brain, spinal\ncord, or peripheral nervous system may be damaged. For example, to check whether the hypoglossal nerve\nis functioning correctly, the neurologist will ask the patient to move his or her tongue in different ways. If the\npatient does not have full control over tongue movements, then the hypoglossal nerve may be damaged\nor there may be a lesion in the brainstem where the cell bodies of these neurons reside (or there could be\ndamage to the tongue muscle itself).\nNeurologists have other tools besides a physical exam they can use to diagnose particular problems\nin the nervous system. If the patient has had a seizure, for example, the neurologist can use\nelectroencephalography (EEG), which involves taping electrodes to the scalp to record brain activity, to try\nto determine which brain regions are involved in the seizure. In suspected stroke patients, a neurologist can\nuse a computerized tomography (CT) scan, which is a type of X-ray, to look for bleeding in the brain or other\nhealth conditions. To treat patients with neurological problems, neurologists can prescribe medications or\nrefer the patient to a neurosurgeon for surgery.\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\n1147\nThis website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/neurologic_exam) allows you to see the different tests a neurologist might\nuse to see what regions of the nervous system may be damaged in a patient.\nWhat exam might a neurologist perform if a patient had impaired sensory functions?\na.\nplacing a 128 Hz tuning fork over a bone\nb.\ntapping a muscle tendon with a reflex hammer\nc.\nasking a patient to follow commands\nd.\nasking a patient to follow a target through different positions\nMental Illnesses\nMental illnesses are nervous system disorders that result in problems with thinking, mood, or relating with other people.\nThese disorders are severe enough to affect a person\u2019s quality of life and often make it difficult for people to perform the\nroutine tasks of daily living. Debilitating mental disorders plague approximately 12.5 million Americans (about 1 in 17\npeople) at an annual cost of more than $300 billion. There are several types of mental disorders including schizophrenia,\nmajor depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders and phobias, post-traumatic stress disorders, and obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder (OCD), among others. The American Psychiatric Association publishes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\nof Mental Disorders (or DSM), which describes the symptoms required for a patient to be diagnosed with a particular\nmental disorder. Each newly released version of the DSM contains different symptoms and classifications as scientists learn\nmore about these disorders, their causes, and how they relate to each other. A more detailed discussion of two mental\nillnesses\u2014schizophrenia and major depression\u2014is given below.\nSchizophrenia\nSchizophrenia is a serious and often debilitating mental illness affecting one percent of people in the United States.\nSymptoms of the disease include the inability to differentiate between reality and imagination, inappropriate and\nunregulated emotional responses, difficulty thinking, and problems with social situations. People with schizophrenia can\nsuffer from hallucinations and hear voices; they may also suffer from delusions. Patients also have so-called \u201cnegative\u201d\nsymptoms like a flattened emotional state, loss of pleasure, and loss of basic drives. Many schizophrenic patients are\ndiagnosed in their late adolescence or early 20s. The development of schizophrenia is thought to involve malfunctioning\ndopaminergic neurons and may also involve problems with glutamate signaling. Treatment for the disease usually requires\nantipsychotic medications that work by blocking dopamine receptors and decreasing dopamine neurotransmission in the\nbrain. This decrease in dopamine can cause Parkinson\u2019s disease-like symptoms in some patients. While some classes of\nantipsychotics can be quite effective at treating the disease, they are not a cure, and most patients must remain medicated\nfor the rest of their lives.\nDepression\nMajor depression affects approximately 6.7 percent of the adults in the United States each year and is one of the most\ncommon mental disorders. To be diagnosed with major depressive disorder, a person must have experienced a severely\ndepressed mood lasting longer than two weeks along with other symptoms including a loss of enjoyment in activities that\nwere previously enjoyed, changes in appetite and sleep schedules, difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness, and\nsuicidal thoughts. The exact causes of major depression are unknown and likely include both genetic and environmental\nrisk factors. Some research supports the \u201cclassic monoamine hypothesis,\u201d which suggests that depression is caused by a\ndecrease in norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmission. One argument against this hypothesis is the fact that some\nantidepressant medications cause an increase in norepinephrine and serotonin release within a few hours of beginning\ntreatment\u2014but clinical results of these medications are not seen until weeks later. This has led to alternative hypotheses:\nfor example, dopamine may also be decreased in depressed patients, or it may actually be an increase in norepinephrine\nand serotonin that causes the disease, and antidepressants force a feedback loop that decreases this release. Treatments for\n1148\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\ndepression include psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, deep-brain stimulation, and prescription medications. There\nare several classes of antidepressant medications that work through different mechanisms. For example, monoamine oxidase\ninhibitors (MAO inhibitors) block the enzyme that degrades many neurotransmitters (including dopamine, serotonin,\nnorepinephrine), resulting in increased neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\nblock the reuptake of serotonin into the presynaptic neuron. This blockage results in an increase in serotonin in the synaptic\ncleft. Other types of drugs such as norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors and norepinephrine-serotonin reuptake\ninhibitors are also used to treat depression.\nOther Neurological Disorders\nThere are several other neurological disorders that cannot be easily placed in the above categories. These include chronic\npain conditions, cancers of the nervous system, epilepsy disorders, and stroke. Epilepsy and stroke are discussed below.\nEpilepsy\nEstimates suggest that up to three percent of people in the United States will be diagnosed with epilepsy in their lifetime.\nWhile there are several different types of epilepsy, all are characterized by recurrent seizures. Epilepsy itself can be a\nsymptom of a brain injury, disease, or other illness. For example, people who have intellectual disability or ASD can\nexperience seizures, presumably because the developmental wiring malfunctions that caused their disorders also put them at\nrisk for epilepsy. For many patients, however, the cause of their epilepsy is never identified and is likely to be a combination\nof genetic and environmental factors. Often, seizures can be controlled with anticonvulsant medications. However, for very\nsevere cases, patients may undergo brain surgery to remove the brain area where seizures originate.\nStroke\nA stroke results when blood fails to reach a portion of the brain for a long enough time to cause damage. Without\nthe oxygen supplied by blood flow, neurons in this brain region die. This neuronal death can cause many different\nsymptoms\u2014depending on the brain area affected\u2014 including headache, muscle weakness or paralysis, speech disturbances,\nsensory problems, memory loss, and confusion. Stroke is often caused by blood clots and can also be caused by the bursting\nof a weak blood vessel. Strokes are extremely common and are the third most common cause of death in the United States.\nOn average one person experiences a stroke every 40 seconds in the United States. Approximately 75 percent of strokes\noccur in people older than 65. Risk factors for stroke include high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and a family\nhistory of stroke. Because a stroke is a medical emergency, patients with symptoms of a stroke should immediately go to\nthe emergency room, where they can receive drugs that will dissolve any clot that may have formed. These drugs will not\nwork if the stroke was caused by a burst blood vessel or if the stroke occurred more than three hours before arriving at the\nhospital. Treatment following a stroke can include blood pressure medication (to prevent future strokes) and (sometimes\nintense) physical therapy.\nChapter 26 | The Nervous System\n1149\nacetylcholine\naction potential\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease\namygdala\narachnoid mater\nastrocyte\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\nautism spectrum disorder (ASD)\nautonomic nervous system\naxon\naxon hillock\naxon terminal\nbasal ganglia\nbasal nuclei\nbrainstem\ncerebellum\ncerebral cortex\ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\nchoroid plexus\ncingulate gyrus\ncorpus callosum\ncranial nerve\ndendrite\ndepolarization\ndura mater\nependymal\nKEY TERMS\nneurotransmitter released by neurons in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system\nself-propagating momentary change in the electrical potential of a neuron (or muscle) membrane\nneurodegenerative disorder characterized by problems with memory and thinking\nstructure within the limbic system that processes fear\nspiderweb-like middle layer of the meninges that cover the central nervous system\nglial cell in the central nervous system that provide nutrients, extracellular buffering, and structural support for\nneurons;

        "summary": "Nervous system disorders encompass a wide range of conditions that impair the brain, spinal cord, and nerves, affecting movement, cognition, emotion, and other bodily functions. Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), involve progressive neuron loss, with symptoms and severity depending on affected regions; treatments focus on symptom management, as cures are unavailable. Neurodevelopmental disorders, like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), result from disrupted nervous system development, often with genetic and environmental influences, and are treated with behavioral therapies and medications. Mental illnesses, including schizophrenia and major depression, impair thinking, mood, and relationships, often requiring long-term medication and therapy. Other neurological disorders include epilepsy, characterized by recurrent seizures, and stroke, caused by interrupted brain blood flow, both of which require urgent or ongoing medical intervention. Neurologists diagnose and manage these conditions using physical exams, imaging, and electroencephalography, aiming to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life."

Animals\u2019 senses are constantly\nat work, making them aware of stimuli, such as light, or sound, or the presence of a chemical substance in the external\nenvironment. They also monitor information about the organism\u2019s internal environment. The shark pictured above has the\nability to perceive natural electrical stimuli produced by other animals in its environment, a sense called electroreception.\nThis enhanced ability to sense prey gives the shark an evolutionary advantage over other fish. While it is helpful to this\nunderwater predator, electroreception is a sense not found in most land animals. You can read more about electroreception\nin sharks at the Sharks info website (http://openstax.org/l/32sharks) .\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe content in this chapter is not within the scope of AP\u00ae other than to recognize the link between the sensory organs\nand the nervous system. The ability to detect and respond to information is critical to an organism\u2019s survival and\nfitness. If time permits, you might explore the evolution of one type of sensory receptor (photoreceptors, chemoreceptor,\nthermoreceptor, or proprioceptor) in several different animal species, with special consideration of the features that allow it\nto convert a stimulus to a nerve impulse. (This task is an application of information in Big Idea 1 of the AP\u00ae Curriculum\nFramework\u2014that the evolution of a structure such as a sensory receptor supports the concept that evolution continues to\noccur.)\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\n1165\n27.1 | Sensory Processes\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the general and special senses in humans?\n\u2022\nWhat are three important steps in sensory perception?\n\u2022\nWhat is the concept of just-noticeable difference in sensory perception?\nSenses provide information about the body and its environment. Humans have five special senses: olfaction (smell),\ngustation (taste), equilibrium (balance and body position), vision, and hearing. Additionally, we possess general senses,\nalso called somatosensation, which respond to stimuli like temperature, pain, pressure, and vibration. Vestibular sensation,\nwhich is an organism\u2019s sense of spatial orientation and balance, proprioception (position of bones, joints, and muscles),\nand the sense of limb position that is used to track kinesthesia (limb movement) are part of somatosensation. Although the\nsensory systems associated with these senses are very different, all share a common function: to convert a stimulus (such as\nlight, or sound, or the position of the body) into an electrical signal in the nervous system. This process is called sensory\ntransduction.\nThere are two broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction. In one, a neuron works with a sensory\nreceptor, a cell, or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific stimulus. Stimulation of the sensory\nreceptor activates the associated afferent neuron, which carries information about the stimulus to the central nervous\nsystem. In the second type of sensory transduction, a sensory nerve ending responds to a stimulus in the internal or\nexternal environment: this neuron constitutes the sensory receptor. Free nerve endings can be stimulated by several different\nstimuli, thus showing little receptor specificity. For example, pain receptors in your gums and teeth may be stimulated by\ntemperature changes, chemical stimulation, or pressure.\nReception\nThe first step in sensation is reception, which is the activation of sensory receptors by stimuli such as mechanical stimuli\n(being bent or squished, for example), chemicals, or temperature. The receptor can then respond to the stimuli. The region\nin space in which a given sensory receptor can respond to a stimulus, be it far away or in contact with the body, is that\nreceptor\u2019s receptive field. Think for a moment about the differences in receptive fields for the different senses. For the sense\nof touch, a stimulus must come into contact with body. For the sense of hearing, a stimulus can be a moderate distance away\n(some baleen whale sounds can propagate for many kilometers). For vision, a stimulus can be very far away; for example,\nthe visual system perceives light from stars at enormous distances.\nTransduction\nThe most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the\nnervous system. This takes place at the sensory receptor, and the change in electrical potential that is produced is called the\nreceptor potential. How is sensory input, such as pressure on the skin, changed to a receptor potential? In this example,\na type of receptor called a mechanoreceptor (as shown in Figure 27.2) possesses specialized membranes that respond to\npressure. Disturbance of these dendrites by compressing them or bending them opens gated ion channels in the plasma\nmembrane of the sensory neuron, changing its electrical potential. Recall that in the nervous system, a positive change of\na neuron\u2019s electrical potential (also called the membrane potential), depolarizes the neuron. Receptor potentials are graded\npotentials: the magnitude of these graded (receptor) potentials varies with the strength of the stimulus. If the magnitude\nof depolarization is sufficient (that is, if membrane potential reaches a threshold), the neuron will fire an action potential.\nIn most cases, the correct stimulus impinging on a sensory receptor will drive membrane potential in a positive direction,\nalthough for some receptors, such as those in the visual system, this is not always the case.\n1166\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 27.2 (a) Mechanosensitive ion channels are gated ion channels that respond to mechanical deformation of the\nplasma membrane. A mechanosensitive channel is connected to the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton by hair-\nlike tethers. When pressure causes the extracellular matrix to move, the channel opens, allowing ions to enter or exit\nthe cell. (b) Stereocilia in the human ear are connected to mechanosensitive ion channels. When a sound causes the\nstereocilia to move, mechanosensitive ion channels transduce the signal to the cochlear nerve.\nSensory receptors for different senses are very different from each other, and they are specialized according to the type of\nstimulus they sense: they have receptor specificity. For example, touch receptors, light receptors, and sound receptors are\neach activated by different stimuli. Touch receptors are not sensitive to light or sound; they are sensitive only to touch or\npressure. However, stimuli may be combined at higher levels in the brain, as happens with olfaction, contributing to our\nsense of taste.\nEncoding and Transmission of Sensory Information\nFour aspects of sensory information are encoded by sensory systems: the type of stimulus, the location of the stimulus in\nthe receptive field, the duration of the stimulus, and the relative intensity of the stimulus. Thus, action potentials transmitted\nover a sensory receptor\u2019s afferent axons encode one type of stimulus, and this segregation of the senses is preserved in other\nsensory circuits. For example, auditory receptors transmit signals over their own dedicated system, and electrical activity in\nthe axons of the auditory receptors will be interpreted by the brain as an auditory stimulus\u2014a sound.\nThe intensity of a stimulus is often encoded in the rate of action potentials produced by the sensory receptor. Thus, an\nintense stimulus will produce a more rapid train of action potentials, and reducing the stimulus will likewise slow the rate\nof production of action potentials. A second way in which intensity is encoded is by the number of receptors activated. An\nintense stimulus might initiate action potentials in a large number of adjacent receptors, while a less intense stimulus might\nstimulate fewer receptors. Integration of sensory information begins as soon as the information is received in the CNS, and\nthe brain will further process incoming signals.\nPerception\nPerception is an individual\u2019s interpretation of a sensation. Although perception relies on the activation of sensory receptors,\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\n1167\nperception happens not at the level of the sensory receptor, but at higher levels in the nervous system, in the brain. The brain\ndistinguishes sensory stimuli through a sensory pathway: action potentials from sensory receptors travel along neurons that\nare dedicated to a particular stimulus. These neurons are dedicated to that particular stimulus and synapse with particular\nneurons in the brain or spinal cord.\nAll sensory signals, except those from the olfactory system, are transmitted though the central nervous system and are routed\nto the thalamus and to the appropriate region of the cortex. Recall that the thalamus is a structure in the forebrain that serves\nas a clearinghouse and relay station for sensory (as well as motor) signals. When the sensory signal exits the thalamus, it is\nconducted to the specific area of the cortex (Figure 27.3) dedicated to processing that particular sense.\nHow are neural signals interpreted? Interpretation of sensory signals between individuals of the same species is largely\nsimilar, owing to the inherited similarity of their nervous systems; however, there are some individual differences. A good\nexample of this is individual tolerances to a painful stimulus, such as dental pain, which certainly differ.\nFigure 27.3 In humans, with the exception of olfaction, all sensory signals are routed from the (a) thalamus to (b) final\nprocessing regions in the cortex of the brain.

There is a one-\npound difference, and one bag is twice as heavy as the other. However, would it be as easy to differentiate\nbetween a 20- and a 21-pound bag?\nQuestion: What is the smallest detectible weight difference between a one-pound bag of rice and a larger\nbag? What is the smallest detectible difference between a 20-pound bag and a larger bag? In both cases,\nat what weights are the differences detected? This smallest detectible difference in stimuli is known as the\njust-noticeable difference (JND).\nBackground: Research background literature on JND and on Weber\u2019s Law, a description of a proposed\nmathematical relationship between the overall magnitude of the stimulus and the JND. You will be testing\nJND of different weights of rice in bags. Choose a convenient increment that is to be stepped through while\ntesting. For example, you could choose 10 percent increments between one and two pounds (1.1, 1.2, 1.3,\n1.4, and so on) or 20 percent increments (1.2, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.8).\nHypothesis: Develop a hypothesis about JND in terms of percentage of the whole weight being tested\n(such as \u201cthe JND between the two small bags and between the two large bags is proportionally the same,\u201d\nor \u201c. . . is not proportionally the same.\u201d) So, for the first hypothesis, if the JND between the one-pound\nbag and a larger bag is 0.2 pounds (that is, 20 percent; 1.0 pound feels the same as 1.1 pounds, but 1.0\npound feels less than 1.2 pounds), then the JND between the 20-pound bag and a larger bag will also be\n20 percent. (So, 20 pounds feels the same as 22 pounds or 23 pounds, but 20 pounds feels less than 24\npounds.)\nTest the hypothesis: Enlist 24 participants, and split them into two groups of 12. To set up the\ndemonstration, assuming a 10 percent increment was selected, have the first group be the one-pound\ngroup. As a counter-balancing measure against a systematic error, however, six of the first group will\ncompare one pound to two pounds, and step down in weight (1.0 to 2.0, 1.0 to 1.9, and so on.), while the\nother six will step up (1.0 to 1.1, 1.0 to 1.2, and so on). Apply the same principle to the 20-pound group (20\nto 40, 20 to 38, and so on, and 20 to 22, 20 to 24, and so on). Given the large difference between 20 and 40\npounds, you may wish to use 30 pounds as your larger weight. In any case, use two weights that are easily\ndetectable as different.\nRecord the observations: Record the data in a table similar to the table below. For the one-pound and\n20-pound groups (base weights) record a plus sign (+) for each participant that detects a difference between\nthe base weight and the step weight. Record a minus sign (-) for each participant that finds no difference. If\none-tenth steps were not used, then replace the steps in the \u201cStep Weight\u201d columns with the step you are\nusing.\nResults of JND Testing (+ = difference; \u2013 = no difference)\nStep Weight\nOne pound\n20 pounds\nStep Weight\n1.1\n22\n1.2\n24\n1.3\n26\n1.4\n28\n1.5\n30\n1.6\n32\n1.7\n34\n1.8\n36\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\n1169\nResults of JND Testing (+ = difference; \u2013 = no difference)\nStep Weight\nOne pound\n20 pounds\nStep Weight\n1.9\n38\n2.0\n40\nTable 27.1\nAnalyze the data/report the results: What step weight did all participants find to be equal with one-pound\nbase weight?

        "summary": "Sensory processes involve the detection and interpretation of stimuli from the body and environment through general and special senses. Humans have five special senses\u2014smell, taste, equilibrium, vision, and hearing\u2014as well as general senses (somatosensation) that detect temperature, pain, pressure, and vibration. All sensory systems convert stimuli into electrical signals via sensory transduction, either through specialized receptor cells linked to afferent neurons or through sensory nerve endings that act as receptors. Sensation begins with reception, where receptors respond to mechanical, chemical, or thermal stimuli within their receptive fields, followed by transduction, in which receptor potentials\u2014graded changes in membrane potential\u2014may trigger action potentials. Sensory information is encoded by stimulus type, location, duration, and intensity before being transmitted along dedicated pathways to the brain. Perception, occurring in specific cortical regions (with most signals routed through the thalamus), is the brain\u2019s interpretation of these inputs and may vary among individuals. The concept of just-noticeable difference (JND) describes the smallest detectable change in a stimulus, often proportional to the original magnitude, as explained by Weber\u2019s Law."

(credit: modification of work\nby Don Bliss, National Cancer Institute)\nSomatosensory Receptors\nSensory receptors are classified into five categories: mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, proprioceptors, pain receptors,\nand chemoreceptors. These categories are based on the nature of stimuli each receptor class transduces. What is commonly\nreferred to as \u201ctouch\u201d involves more than one kind of stimulus and more than one kind of receptor. Mechanoreceptors in\nthe skin are described as encapsulated (that is, surrounded by a capsule) or unencapsulated (a group that includes free nerve\nendings). A free nerve ending, as its name implies, is an unencapsulated dendrite of a sensory neuron. Free nerve endings\nare the most common nerve endings in skin, and they extend into the middle of the epidermis. Free nerve endings are\nsensitive to painful stimuli, to hot and cold, and to light touch. They are slow to adjust to a stimulus and so are less sensitive\nto abrupt changes in stimulation.\nThere are three classes of mechanoreceptors: tactile, proprioceptors, and baroreceptors. Mechanoreceptors sense stimuli due\nto physical deformation of their plasma membranes. They contain mechanically gated ion channels whose gates open or\nclose in response to pressure, touch, stretching, and sound.\u201d There are four primary tactile mechanoreceptors in human skin:\nMerkel\u2019s disks, Meissner\u2019s corpuscles, Ruffini endings, and Pacinian corpuscle; two are located toward the surface of the\nskin and two are located deeper. A fifth type of mechanoreceptor, Krause end bulbs, are found only in specialized regions.\nMerkel\u2019s disks (shown in Figure 27.5) are found in the upper layers of skin near the base of the epidermis, both in skin\nthat has hair and on glabrous skin, that is, the hairless skin found on the palms and fingers, the soles of the feet, and the\nlips of humans and other primates. Merkel\u2019s disks are densely distributed in the fingertips and lips. They are slow-adapting,\nencapsulated nerve endings, and they respond to light touch. Light touch, also known as discriminative touch, is a light\npressure that allows the location of a stimulus to be pinpointed. The receptive fields of Merkel\u2019s disks are small with well-\ndefined borders. That makes them finely sensitive to edges and they come into use in tasks such as typing on a keyboard.\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\n1171\nFigure 27.5 Four of the primary mechanoreceptors in human skin are shown. Merkel\u2019s disks, which are\nunencapsulated, respond to light touch. Meissner\u2019s corpuscles, Ruffini endings, Pacinian corpuscles, and Krause\nend bulbs are all encapsulated. Meissner\u2019s corpuscles respond to touch and low-frequency vibration. Ruffini\nendings detect stretch, deformation within joints, and warmth. Pacinian corpuscles detect transient pressure and\nhigh-frequency vibration. Krause end bulbs detect cold.\nWhich of the following statements about mechanoreceptors is true?\na.\nMeissner\u2019s corpuscles extend far into the epidermis.\nb.\nRuffini endings are the only encapsulated mechanoreceptors.\nc.\nLight touch is detected by Pacini corpuscles.\nd.\nMerkel\u2019s disks are abundant on the fingertips and lips.\nMeissner\u2019s corpuscles, (shown in Figure 27.6) also known as tactile corpuscles, are found in the upper dermis, but they\nproject into the epidermis. They, too, are found primarily in the glabrous skin on the fingertips and eyelids. They respond to\nfine touch and pressure, but they also respond to low-frequency vibration or flutter. They are rapidly adapting, fluid-filled,\nencapsulated neurons with small, well-defined borders and are responsive to fine details. Like Merkel\u2019s disks, Meissner\u2019s\ncorpuscles are not as plentiful in the palms as they are in the fingertips.\nFigure 27.6 Meissner corpuscles in the fingertips, such as the one viewed here using bright field light microscopy,\nallow for touch discrimination of fine detail. (credit: modification of work by \"Wbensmith\"/Wikimedia Commons; scale-\nbar data from Matt Russell)\nDeeper in the epidermis, near the base, are Ruffini endings, which are also known as bulbous corpuscles. They are\nfound in both glabrous and hairy skin. These are slow-adapting, encapsulated mechanoreceptors that detect skin stretch\nand deformations within joints, so they provide valuable feedback for gripping objects and controlling finger position and\nmovement. Thus, they also contribute to proprioception and kinesthesia. Ruffini endings also detect warmth. Note that these\n1172\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nwarmth detectors are situated deeper in the skin than are the cold detectors. It is not surprising, then, that humans detect\ncold stimuli before they detect warm stimuli.\nPacinian corpuscles (seen in Figure 27.7) are located deep in the dermis of both glabrous and hairy skin and are\nstructurally similar to Meissner\u2019s corpuscles; they are found in the bone periosteum, joint capsules, pancreas and other\nviscera, breast, and genitals. They are rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors that sense deep transient (but not prolonged)\npressure and high-frequency vibration. Pacinian receptors detect pressure and vibration by being compressed, stimulating\ntheir internal dendrites. There are fewer Pacinian corpuscles and Ruffini endings in skin than there are Merkel\u2019s disks and\nMeissner\u2019s corpuscles.\nFigure 27.7 Pacinian corpuscles, such as these visualized using bright field light microscopy, detect pressure (touch)\nand high-frequency vibration. (credit: modification of work by Ed Uthman; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nIn proprioception, proprioceptive and kinesthetic signals travel through myelinated afferent neurons running from the spinal\ncord to the medulla. Neurons are not physically connected, but communicate via neurotransmitters secreted into synapses\nor \u201cgaps\u201d between communicating neurons. Once in the medulla, the neurons continue carrying the signals to the thalamus.\nMuscle spindles are stretch receptors that detect the amount of stretch, or lengthening of muscles. Related to these are\nGolgi tendon organs, which are tension receptors that detect the force of muscle contraction. Proprioceptive and kinesthetic\nsignals come from limbs. Unconscious proprioceptive signals run from the spinal cord to the cerebellum, the brain region\nthat coordinates muscle contraction, rather than to the thalamus, like most other sensory information.\nBaroreceptors detect pressure changes in an organ. They are found in the walls of the carotid artery and the aorta where\nthey monitor blood pressure, and in the lungs where they detect the degree of lung expansion. Stretch receptors are found at\nvarious sites in the digestive and urinary systems.\nIn addition to these two types of deeper receptors, there are also rapidly adapting hair receptors, which are found on nerve\nendings that wrap around the base of hair follicles. There are a few types of hair receptors that detect slow and rapid hair\nmovement, and they differ in their sensitivity to movement. Some hair receptors also detect skin deflection, and certain\nrapidly adapting hair receptors allow detection of stimuli that have not yet touched the skin.\nIntegration of Signals from Mechanoreceptors\nThe configuration of the different types of receptors working in concert in human skin results in a very refined sense\nof touch. The nociceptive receptors\u2014those that detect pain\u2014are located near the surface. Small, finely calibrated\nmechanoreceptors\u2014Merkel\u2019s disks and Meissner\u2019s corpuscles\u2014are located in the upper layers and can precisely localize\neven gentle touch. The large mechanoreceptors\u2014Pacinian corpuscles and Ruffini endings\u2014are located in the lower layers\nand respond to deeper touch. (Consider that the deep pressure that reaches those deeper receptors would not need to be\nfinely localized.) Both the upper and lower layers of the skin hold rapidly and slowly adapting receptors. Both primary\nsomatosensory cortex and secondary cortical areas are responsible for processing the complex picture of stimuli transmitted\nfrom the interplay of mechanoreceptors.\nDensity of Mechanoreceptors\nThe distribution of touch receptors in human skin is not consistent over the body. In humans, touch receptors are less dense\nin skin covered with any type of hair, such as the arms, legs, torso, and face. Touch receptors are denser in glabrous skin\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\n1173\n(the type found on human fingertips and lips, for example), which is typically more sensitive and is thicker than hairy skin\n(4 to 5 mm versus 2 to 3 mm).\nHow is receptor density estimated in a human subject? The relative density of pressure receptors in different locations on\nthe body can be demonstrated experimentally using a two-point discrimination test. In this demonstration, two sharp points,\nsuch as two thumbtacks, are brought into contact with the subject\u2019s skin (though not hard enough to cause pain or break the\nskin). The subject reports if he or she feels one point or two points. If the two points are felt as one point, it can be inferred\nthat the two points are both in the receptive field of a single sensory receptor. If two points are felt as two separate points,\neach is in the receptive field of two separate sensory receptors. The points could then be moved closer and re-tested until\nthe subject reports feeling only one point, and the size of the receptive field of a single receptor could be estimated from\nthat distance.\nThermoreception\nIn addition to Krause end bulbs that detect cold and Ruffini endings that detect warmth, there are different types of cold\nreceptors on some free nerve endings: thermoreceptors, located in the dermis, skeletal muscles, liver, and hypothalamus,\nthat are activated by different temperatures. Their pathways into the brain run from the spinal cord through the thalamus\nto the primary somatosensory cortex. Warmth and cold information from the face travels through one of the cranial nerves\nto the brain. You know from experience that a tolerably cold or hot stimulus can quickly progress to a much more intense\nstimulus that is no longer tolerable. Any stimulus that is too intense can be perceived as pain because temperature sensations\nare conducted along the same pathways that carry pain sensations\nPain\nPain is the name given to nociception, which is the neural processing of injurious stimuli in response to tissue damage. Pain\nis caused by true sources of injury, such as contact with a heat source that causes a thermal burn or contact with a corrosive\nchemical. But pain also can be caused by harmless stimuli that mimic the action of damaging stimuli, such as contact with\ncapsaicins, the compounds that cause peppers to taste hot and which are used in self-defense pepper sprays and certain\ntopical medications. Peppers taste \u201chot\u201d because the protein receptors that bind capsaicin open the same calcium channels\nthat are activated by warm receptors.\nNociception starts at the sensory receptors, but pain, in-as-much as it is the perception of nociception, does not start until\nit is communicated to the brain. There are several nociceptive pathways to and through the brain. Most axons carrying\nnociceptive information into the brain from the spinal cord project to the thalamus (as do other sensory neurons) and\nthe neural signal undergoes final processing in the primary somatosensory cortex. Interestingly, one nociceptive pathway\nprojects not to the thalamus but directly to the hypothalamus in the forebrain, which modulates the cardiovascular and\nneuroendocrine functions of the autonomic nervous system. Recall that threatening\u2014or painful\u2014stimuli stimulate the\nsympathetic branch of the visceral sensory system, readying a fight-or-flight response.\nView this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/nociceptive) that animates the five phases of nociceptive pain.\nSelect the stimulus that can activate the nociceptive system.\na.\na pleasant melody on a harp\nb.\na delicious apple\nc.\nthe aroma of freshly baked cookies\nd.\nburning your hand on a stove\n1174\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\n27.3 | Taste and Smell\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nIn what way do smell and taste stimuli differ from other sensory stimuli?\n\u2022\nWhat are the five primary tastes that can be distinguished by humans?\n\u2022\nIn anatomical terms why is a dog\u2019s sense of smell more acute than a human\u2019s?\nTaste, also called gustation, and smell, also called olfaction, are the most interconnected senses in that both involve\nmolecules of the stimulus entering the body and bonding to receptors. Smell lets an animal sense the presence of food or\nother animals\u2014whether potential mates, predators, or prey\u2014or other chemicals in the environment that can impact their\nsurvival. Similarly, the sense of taste allows animals to discriminate between types of foods. While the value of a sense\nof smell is obvious, what is the value of a sense of taste? Different tasting foods have different attributes, both helpful\nand harmful. For example, sweet-tasting substances tend to be highly caloric, which could be necessary for survival in\nlean times. Bitterness is associated with toxicity, and sourness is associated with spoiled food. Salty foods are valuable in\nmaintaining homeostasis by helping the body retain water and by providing ions necessary for cells to function.\nTastes and Odors\nBoth taste and odor stimuli are molecules taken in from the environment. The primary tastes detected by humans are sweet,\nsour, bitter, salty and umami. The first four tastes need little explanation. The identification of umami as a fundamental\ntaste occurred fairly recently\u2014it was identified in 1908 by Japanese scientist Kikunae Ikeda while he worked with seaweed\nbroth, but it was not widely accepted as a taste that could be physiologically distinguished until many years later. The taste of\numami, also known as savoriness, is attributable to the taste of the amino acid L-glutamate. In fact, monosodium glutamate,\nor MSG, is often used in cooking to enhance the savory taste of certain foods. What is the adaptive value of being able to\ndistinguish umami? Savory substances tend to be high in protein.\nAll odors that we perceive are molecules in the air we breathe. If a substance does not release molecules into the air from\nits surface, it has no smell. And if a human or other animal does not have a receptor that recognizes a specific molecule,\nthen that molecule has no smell. Humans have about 350 olfactory receptor subtypes that work in various combinations\nto allow us to sense about 10,000 different odors. Compare that to mice, for example, which have about 1,300 olfactory\nreceptor types, and therefore probably sense more odors. Both odors and tastes involve molecules that stimulate specific\nchemoreceptors.

        "summary": "Somatosensation, or the sense of touch, encompasses sensations from the skin, mucous membranes, muscles, joints, and internal organs, mediated by various specialized receptors. Skin contains three layers\u2014epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis\u2014housing mechanoreceptors (for touch and pressure), thermoreceptors (for temperature), proprioceptors (for body position), pain receptors (nociceptors), and chemoreceptors. Four primary tactile mechanoreceptors are Merkel\u2019s disks and Meissner\u2019s corpuscles (superficial, fine touch) and Ruffini endings and Pacinian corpuscles (deeper, stretch, pressure, vibration), with receptor density being higher in glabrous skin like fingertips and lips. Hair receptors detect hair movement, while proprioceptors such as muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs sense muscle stretch and tension, and baroreceptors monitor pressure in organs. Thermoreceptors detect warmth and cold, with cold sensed more quickly than warmth; extreme temperatures can trigger pain perception through shared neural pathways. Pain arises from nociception, the neural processing of harmful stimuli, and is ultimately perceived in the brain after integration in the somatosensory cortex or other regions, with some pathways influencing autonomic responses."

        "text": "27.3 | Taste and Smell\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nIn what way do smell and taste stimuli differ from other sensory stimuli?\n\u2022\nWhat are the five primary tastes that can be distinguished by humans?\n\u2022\nIn anatomical terms why is a dog\u2019s sense of smell more acute than a human\u2019s?\nTaste, also called gustation, and smell, also called olfaction, are the most interconnected senses in that both involve\nmolecules of the stimulus entering the body and bonding to receptors. Smell lets an animal sense the presence of food or\nother animals\u2014whether potential mates, predators, or prey\u2014or other chemicals in the environment that can impact their\nsurvival. Similarly, the sense of taste allows animals to discriminate between types of foods. While the value of a sense\nof smell is obvious, what is the value of a sense of taste? Different tasting foods have different attributes, both helpful\nand harmful. For example, sweet-tasting substances tend to be highly caloric, which could be necessary for survival in\nlean times. Bitterness is associated with toxicity, and sourness is associated with spoiled food. Salty foods are valuable in\nmaintaining homeostasis by helping the body retain water and by providing ions necessary for cells to function.\nTastes and Odors\nBoth taste and odor stimuli are molecules taken in from the environment. The primary tastes detected by humans are sweet,\nsour, bitter, salty and umami. The first four tastes need little explanation. The identification of umami as a fundamental\ntaste occurred fairly recently\u2014it was identified in 1908 by Japanese scientist Kikunae Ikeda while he worked with seaweed\nbroth, but it was not widely accepted as a taste that could be physiologically distinguished until many years later. The taste of\numami, also known as savoriness, is attributable to the taste of the amino acid L-glutamate. In fact, monosodium glutamate,\nor MSG, is often used in cooking to enhance the savory taste of certain foods. What is the adaptive value of being able to\ndistinguish umami? Savory substances tend to be high in protein.\nAll odors that we perceive are molecules in the air we breathe. If a substance does not release molecules into the air from\nits surface, it has no smell. And if a human or other animal does not have a receptor that recognizes a specific molecule,\nthen that molecule has no smell. Humans have about 350 olfactory receptor subtypes that work in various combinations\nto allow us to sense about 10,000 different odors. Compare that to mice, for example, which have about 1,300 olfactory\nreceptor types, and therefore probably sense more odors. Both odors and tastes involve molecules that stimulate specific\nchemoreceptors. Although humans commonly distinguish taste as one sense and smell as another, they work together to\ncreate the perception of flavor. A person\u2019s perception of flavor is reduced if he or she has congested nasal passages.\nReception and Transduction\nOdorants (odor molecules) enter the nose and dissolve in the olfactory epithelium, the mucosa at the back of the nasal\ncavity (as illustrated in Figure 27.8). The olfactory epithelium is a collection of specialized olfactory receptors in the back\nof the nasal cavity that spans an area about 5 cm2 in humans. Recall that sensory cells are neurons. An olfactory receptor,\nwhich is a dendrite of a specialized neuron, responds when it binds certain molecules inhaled from the environment by\nsending impulses directly to the olfactory bulb of the brain. Humans have about 12 million olfactory receptors, distributed\namong hundreds of different receptor types that respond to different odors. Twelve million seems like a large number\nof receptors, but compare that to other animals: rabbits have about 100 million, most dogs have about 1 billion, and\nbloodhounds\u2014dogs selectively bred for their sense of smell\u2014have about 4 billion.

Pheromonal signals can have profound effects on animals that inhale them, but\npheromones apparently are not consciously perceived in the same way as other odors. There are several\ndifferent types of pheromones, which are released in urine or as glandular secretions. Certain pheromones\nare attractants to potential mates, others are repellants to potential competitors of the same sex, and still\nothers play roles in mother-infant attachment. Some pheromones can also influence the timing of puberty,\nmodify reproductive cycles, and even prevent embryonic implantation. While the roles of pheromones in\nmany nonhuman species are important, pheromones have become less important in human behavior over\nevolutionary time compared to their importance to organisms with more limited behavioral repertoires.\nThe vomeronasal organ (VNO, or Jacobson\u2019s organ) is a tubular, fluid-filled, olfactory organ present in many\nvertebrate animals that sits adjacent to the nasal cavity. It is very sensitive to pheromones and is connected\nto the nasal cavity by a duct. When molecules dissolve in the mucosa of the nasal cavity, they then enter\nthe VNO where the pheromone molecules among them bind with specialized pheromone receptors. Upon\nexposure to pheromones from their own species or others, many animals, including cats, may display the\nflehmen response (shown in Figure 27.9), a curling of the upper lip that helps pheromone molecules enter\nthe VNO.\nPheromonal signals are sent, not to the main olfactory bulb, but to a different neural structure that projects\ndirectly to the amygdala (recall that the amygdala is a brain center important in emotional reactions, such\nas fear). The pheromonal signal then continues to areas of the hypothalamus that are key to reproductive\nphysiology and behavior. While some scientists assert that the VNO is apparently functionally vestigial in\nhumans, even though there is a similar structure located near human nasal cavities, others are researching\nit as a possible functional system that may, for example, contribute to synchronization of menstrual cycles\nin women living in close proximity.\nFigure 27.9 The flehmen response in this tiger results in the curling of the upper lip and helps airborne pheromone\nmolecules enter the vomeronasal organ.

The dissolved molecules bind to\nreceptors, which send a signal to the hypothalamus, which in turn sends the signal to the vomeronasal organ.\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\n1177\nTaste\nDetecting a taste (gustation) is fairly similar to detecting an odor (olfaction), given that both taste and smell rely on chemical\nreceptors being stimulated by certain molecules. The primary organ of taste is the taste bud. A taste bud is a cluster of\ngustatory receptors (taste cells) that are located within the bumps on the tongue called papillae (singular: papilla) (illustrated\nin Figure 27.10). There are several structurally distinct papillae. Filiform papillae, which are located across the tongue, are\ntactile, providing friction that helps the tongue move substances, and contain no taste cells. In contrast, fungiform papillae,\nwhich are located mainly on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, each contain one to eight taste buds and also have\nreceptors for pressure and temperature. The large circumvallate papillae contain up to 100 taste buds and form a V near the\nposterior margin of the tongue.\nFigure 27.10 (a) Foliate, circumvallate, and fungiform papillae are located on different regions of the tongue. (b) Foliate\npapillae are prominent protrusions on this light micrograph. (credit a: modification of work by NCI; scale-bar data from\nMatt Russell)\nIn addition to those two types of chemically and mechanically sensitive papillae are foliate papillae\u2014leaf-like papillae\nlocated in parallel folds along the edges and toward the back of the tongue, as seen in the Figure 27.10 micrograph. Foliate\npapillae contain about 1,300 taste buds within their folds. Finally, there are circumvallate papillae, which are wall-like\npapillae in the shape of an inverted \u201cV\u201d at the back of the tongue. Each of these papillae is surrounded by a groove and\ncontains about 250 taste buds.\nEach taste bud\u2019s taste cells are replaced every 10 to 14 days. These are elongated cells with hair-like processes called\nmicrovilli at the tips that extend into the taste bud pore (illustrate in Figure 27.11). Food molecules (tastants) are dissolved\nin saliva, and they bind with and stimulate the receptors on the microvilli. The receptors for tastants are located across the\nouter portion and front of the tongue, outside of the middle area where the filiform papillae are most prominent.\n1178\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 27.11 Pores in the tongue allow tastants to enter taste pores in the tongue. (credit: modification of work by\nVincenzo Rizzo)\nIn humans, there are five primary tastes, and each taste has only one corresponding type of receptor. Thus, like olfaction,\neach receptor is specific to its stimulus (tastant). Transduction of the five tastes happens through different mechanisms\nthat reflect the molecular composition of the tastant. A salty tastant (containing NaCl) provides the sodium ions (Na+) that\nenter the taste neurons and excite them directly. Sour tastants are acids and belong to the thermoreceptor protein family.\nBinding of an acid or other sour-tasting molecule triggers a change in the ion channel and these increase hydrogen ion (H+)\nconcentrations in the taste neurons, thus depolarizing them. Sweet, bitter, and umami tastants require a G-protein coupled\nreceptor. These tastants bind to their respective receptors, thereby exciting the specialized neurons associated with them.\nBoth tasting abilities and sense of smell change with age. In humans, the senses decline dramatically by age 50 and continue\nto decline. A child may find a food to be too spicy, whereas an elderly person may find the same food to be bland and\nunappetizing.\nView this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/taste) that shows how the sense of taste works.\nWhich of the following is true about human taste?\na.\nTaste buds are covered in papillae.\nb.\nSaliva contains taste receptor cells.\nc.\nPapillae stimulate the hair-like endings of taste buds.\nd.\nThe hair-like endings of taste buds generate nerve impulses to the brain.\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\n1179\nSmell and Taste in the Brain\nOlfactory neurons project from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb as thin, unmyelinated axons. The olfactory\nbulb is composed of neural clusters called glomeruli, and each glomerulus receives signals from one type of olfactory\nreceptor, so each glomerulus is specific to one odorant. From glomeruli, olfactory signals travel directly to the olfactory\ncortex and then to the frontal cortex and the thalamus. Recall that this is a different path from most other sensory\ninformation, which is sent directly to the thalamus before ending up in the cortex. Olfactory signals also travel directly to\nthe amygdala, thereafter reaching the hypothalamus, thalamus, and frontal cortex. The last structure that olfactory signals\ndirectly travel to is a cortical center in the temporal lobe structure important in spatial, autobiographical, declarative, and\nepisodic memories. Olfaction is finally processed by areas of the brain that deal with memory, emotions, reproduction, and\nthought.\nTaste neurons project from taste cells in the tongue, esophagus, and palate to the medulla, in the brainstem. From the\nmedulla, taste signals travel to the thalamus and then to the primary gustatory cortex. Information from different regions of\nthe tongue is segregated in the medulla, thalamus, and cortex.\n27.4 | Hearing and Vestibular Sensation\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat is the relationship of amplitude and frequency of a sound wave to the attributes of sound?\n\u2022\nWhat path does sound travel within the auditory system to the site of transduction of sound?\n\u2022\nWhat are the structures of the vestibular system that respond to gravity?\nAudition, or hearing, is important to humans and to other animals for many different interactions. It enables an organism\nto detect and receive information about danger, such as an approaching predator, and to participate in communal exchanges\nlike those concerning territories or mating. On the other hand, although it is physically linked to the auditory system, the\nvestibular system is not involved in hearing. Instead, an animal\u2019s vestibular system detects its own movement, both linear\nand angular acceleration and deceleration, and balance.\nSound\nAuditory stimuli are sound waves, which are mechanical, pressure waves that move through a medium, such as air or water.\nThere are no sound waves in a vacuum since there are no air molecules to move in waves. The speed of sound waves differs,\nbased on altitude, temperature, and medium, but at sea level and a temperature of 20\u00ba C (68\u00ba F), sound waves travel in the\nair at about 343 meters per second.\nAs is true for all waves, there are four main characteristics of a sound wave: frequency, wavelength, period, and amplitude.\nFrequency is the number of waves per unit of time, and in sound is heard as pitch. High-frequency (\u226515.000Hz) sounds\nare higher-pitched (short wavelength) than low-frequency (long wavelengths; \u2264100Hz) sounds. Frequency is measured in\ncycles per second, and for sound, the most commonly used unit is hertz (Hz), or cycles per second. Most humans can\nperceive sounds with frequencies between 30 and 20,000 Hz. Women are typically better at hearing high frequencies,\nbut everyone\u2019s ability to hear high frequencies decreases with age. Dogs detect up to about 40,000 Hz; cats, 60,000 Hz;\nbats, 100,000 Hz; and dolphins 150,000 Hz, and American shad (Alosa sapidissima), a fish, can hear 180,000 Hz. Those\nfrequencies above the human range are called ultrasound.\nAmplitude, or the dimension of a wave from peak to trough, in sound is heard as volume and is illustrated in Figure 27.12.\nThe sound waves of louder sounds have greater amplitude than those of softer sounds. For sound, volume is measured in\ndecibels (dB). The softest sound that a human can hear is the zero point. Humans speak normally at 60 decibels.\n1180\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\n",

Amplitude of the wave corresponds to volume. The\nsound wave shown with a dashed line is softer in volume than the sound wave shown with a solid line. (credit: NIH)\nReception of Sound\nIn mammals, sound waves are collected by the external, cartilaginous part of the ear called the pinna, then travel through\nthe auditory canal and cause vibration of the thin diaphragm called the tympanum or ear drum, the innermost part of\nthe outer ear (illustrated in Figure 27.13). Interior to the tympanum is the middle ear. The middle ear holds three small\nbones called the ossicles, which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear. The three ossicles are the\nmalleus (also known as the hammer), the incus (the anvil), and stapes (the stirrup). The aptly named stapes looks very\nmuch like a stirrup. The three ossicles are unique to mammals, and each plays a role in hearing. The malleus attaches at\nthree points to the interior surface of the tympanic membrane. The incus attaches the malleus to the stapes. In humans,\nthe stapes is not long enough to reach the tympanum. If we did not have the malleus and the incus, then the vibrations\nof the tympanum would never reach the inner ear. These bones also function to collect force and amplify sounds. The ear\nossicles are homologous to bones in a fish mouth: the bones that support gills in fish are thought to be adapted for use in the\nvertebrate ear over evolutionary time. Many animals (frogs, reptiles, and birds, for example) use the stapes of the middle\near to transmit vibrations to the middle ear.\nFigure 27.13 Sound travels through the outer ear to the middle ear, which is bounded on its exterior by the tympanic\nmembrane. The middle ear contains three bones called ossicles that transfer the sound wave to the oval window, the\nexterior boundary of the inner ear. The organ of Corti, which is the organ of sound transduction, lies inside the cochlea.\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\n1181\nTransduction of Sound\nVibrating objects, such as vocal cords, create sound waves or pressure waves in the air. When these pressure waves reach\nthe ear, the ear transduces this mechanical stimulus (pressure wave) into a nerve impulse (electrical signal) that the brain\nperceives as sound. The pressure waves strike the tympanum, causing it to vibrate. The mechanical energy from the moving\ntympanum transmits the vibrations to the three bones of the middle ear. The stapes transmits the vibrations to a thin\ndiaphragm called the oval window, which is the outermost structure of the inner ear. The structures of the inner ear are\nfound in the labyrinth, a bony, hollow structure that is the most interior portion of the ear. Here, the energy from the sound\nwave is transferred from the stapes through the flexible oval window and to the fluid of the cochlea. The vibrations of the\noval window create pressure waves in the fluid (perilymph) inside the cochlea. The cochlea is a whorled structure, like the\nshell of a snail, and it contains receptors for transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal (as illustrated\nin Figure 27.14). Inside the cochlea, the basilar membrane is a mechanical analyzer that runs the length of the cochlea,\ncurling toward the cochlea\u2019s center.\nThe mechanical properties of the basilar membrane change along its length, such that it is thicker, tauter, and narrower at\nthe outside of the whorl (where the cochlea is largest), and thinner, floppier, and broader toward the apex, or center, of the\nwhorl (where the cochlea is smallest). Different regions of the basilar membrane vibrate according to the frequency of the\nsound wave conducted through the fluid in the cochlea. For these reasons, the fluid-filled cochlea detects different wave\nfrequencies (pitches) at different regions of the membrane. When the sound waves in the cochlear fluid contact the basilar\nmembrane, it flexes back and forth in a wave-like fashion. Above the basilar membrane is the tectorial membrane.\n1182\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 27.14 In the human ear, sound waves cause the stapes to press against the oval window. Vibrations travel\nup the fluid-filled interior of the cochlea. The basilar membrane that lines the cochlea gets continuously thinner\ntoward the apex of the cochlea. Different thicknesses of membrane vibrate in response to different frequencies\nof sound. Sound waves then exit through the round window. In the cross section of the cochlea (top right figure),\nnote that in addition to the upper canal and lower canal, the cochlea also has a middle canal.

They number approximately 12,000, and they function to\nfine tune incoming sound waves. The longer stereocilia that project from the outer hair cells actually attach to the tectorial\nmembrane. All of the stereocilia are mechanoreceptors, and when bent by vibrations they respond by opening a gated ion\nchannel (refer to Figure 27.2). As a result, the hair cell membrane is depolarized, and a signal is transmitted to the chochlear\nnerve. Intensity (volume) of sound is determined by how many hair cells at a particular location are stimulated.\nThe hair cells are arranged on the basilar membrane in an orderly way. The basilar membrane vibrates in different regions,\naccording to the frequency of the sound waves impinging on it. Likewise, the hair cells that lay above it are most sensitive\nto a specific frequency of sound waves. Hair cells can respond to a small range of similar frequencies, but they require\nstimulation of greater intensity to fire at frequencies outside of their optimal range. The difference in response frequency\nbetween adjacent inner hair cells is about 0.2 percent. Compare that to adjacent piano strings, which are about six percent\ndifferent. Place theory, which is the model for how biologists think pitch detection works in the human ear, states that high\nfrequency sounds selectively vibrate the basilar membrane of the inner ear near the entrance port (the oval window). Lower\nfrequencies travel farther along the membrane before causing appreciable excitation of the membrane. The basic pitch-\ndetermining mechanism is based on the location along the membrane where the hair cells are stimulated. The place theory\nis the first step toward an understanding of pitch perception. Considering the extreme pitch sensitivity of the human ear, it\nis thought that there must be some auditory \u201csharpening\u201d mechanism to enhance the pitch resolution.\nWhen sound waves produce fluid waves inside the cochlea, the basilar membrane flexes, bending the stereocilia that attach\nto the tectorial membrane. Their bending results in action potentials in the hair cells, and auditory information travels along\nthe neural endings of the bipolar neurons of the hair cells (collectively, the auditory nerve) to the brain. When the hairs\nbend, they release an excitatory neurotransmitter at a synapse with a sensory neuron, which then conducts action potentials\nto the central nervous system. The cochlear branch of the vestibulocochlear cranial nerve sends information on hearing. The\nauditory system is very refined, and there is some modulation or \u201csharpening\u201d built in. The brain can send signals back\nto the cochlea, resulting in a change of length in the outer hair cells, sharpening or dampening the hair cells\u2019 response to\ncertain frequencies.\n1184\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nWatch an animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/hearing) of sound entering the outer ear, moving through the ear\nstructure, stimulating cochlear nerve impulses, and eventually sending signals to the temporal lobe.\nImagine that your friend\u2019s pet dog ran off into the woods while she was hiking.

This enabled the dog to use the timing\nof sound reception in each ear to determine where the sound was coming from.\nHigher Processing\nThe inner hair cells are most important for conveying auditory information to the brain. About 90 percent of the afferent\nneurons carry information from inner hair cells, with each hair cell synapsing with 10 or so neurons. Outer hair cells connect\nto only 10 percent of the afferent neurons, and each afferent neuron innervates many hair cells. The afferent, bipolar neurons\nthat convey auditory information travel from the cochlea to the medulla, through the pons and midbrain in the brainstem,\nfinally reaching the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe.\nVestibular Information\nThe stimuli associated with the vestibular system are linear acceleration (gravity) and angular acceleration and deceleration.\nGravity, acceleration, and deceleration are detected by evaluating the inertia on receptive cells in the vestibular system.\nGravity is detected through head position. Angular acceleration and deceleration are expressed through turning or tilting of\nthe head.\nThe vestibular system has some similarities with the auditory system. It utilizes hair cells just like the auditory system, but\nit excites them in different ways. There are five vestibular receptor organs in the inner ear: the utricle, the saccule, and three\nsemicircular canals. Together, they make up what\u2019s known as the vestibular labyrinth that is shown in Figure 27.15. The\nutricle and saccule respond to acceleration in a straight line, such as gravity. The roughly 30,000 hair cells in the utricle\nand 16,000 hair cells in the saccule lie below a gelatinous layer, with their stereocilia projecting into the gelatin. Embedded\nin this gelatin are calcium carbonate crystals\u2014like tiny rocks. When the head is tilted, the crystals continue to be pulled\nstraight down by gravity, but the new angle of the head causes the gelatin to shift, thereby bending the stereocilia. The\nbending of the stereocilia stimulates the neurons, and they signal to the brain that the head is tilted, allowing the maintenance\nof balance. It is the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear cranial nerve that deals with balance.\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\n1185\nFigure 27.15 The structure of the vestibular labyrinth is shown. (credit: modification of work by NIH)\nThe fluid-filled semicircular canals are tubular loops set at oblique angles. They are arranged in three spatial planes. The\nbase of each canal has a swelling that contains a cluster of hair cells. The hairs project into a gelatinous cap called the cupula\nand monitor angular acceleration and deceleration from rotation. They would be stimulated by driving your car around a\ncorner, turning your head, or falling forward. One canal lies horizontally, while the other two lie at about 45 degree angles to\nthe horizontal axis, as illustrated in Figure 27.15. When the brain processes input from all three canals together, it can detect\nangular acceleration or deceleration in three dimensions. When the head turns, the fluid in the canals shifts, thereby bending\nstereocilia and sending signals to the brain. Upon cessation accelerating or decelerating\u2014or just moving\u2014the movement\nof the fluid within the canals slows or stops. For example, imagine holding a glass of water. When moving forward, water\nmay splash backwards onto the hand, and when motion has stopped, water may splash forward onto the fingers. While in\nmotion, the water settles in the glass and does not splash. Note that the canals are not sensitive to velocity itself, but to\nchanges in velocity, so moving forward at 60mph with your eyes closed would not give the sensation of movement, but\nsuddenly accelerating or braking would stimulate the receptors.\nHigher Processing\nHair cells from the utricle, saccule, and semicircular canals also communicate through bipolar neurons to the cochlear\nnucleus in the medulla. Cochlear neurons send descending projections to the spinal cord and ascending projections to\nthe pons, thalamus, and cerebellum. Connections to the cerebellum are important for coordinated movements. There are\nalso projections to the temporal cortex, which account for feelings of dizziness; projections to autonomic nervous system\nareas in the brainstem, which account for motion sickness; and projections to the primary somatosensory cortex, which\nmonitors subjective measurements of the external world and self-movement. People with lesions in the vestibular area of\nthe somatosensory cortex see vertical objects in the world as being tilted. Finally, the vestibular signals project to certain\noptic muscles to coordinate eye and head movements.\n1186\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nClick through this interactive tutorial (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ear_anatomy) to review the parts of the ear and\nhow they function to process sound.\nYou have trouble maintaining balance.

        "summary": "Hearing, or audition, enables detection of sound waves\u2014mechanical pressure waves characterized by frequency (perceived as pitch) and amplitude (perceived as volume)\u2014which travel through a medium like air or water. In humans, sound is collected by the pinna, funneled through the auditory canal, and vibrates the tympanum, transmitting energy via three middle ear bones (malleus, incus, stapes) to the oval window of the inner ear. Vibrations create fluid waves in the cochlea, where the basilar membrane, varying in stiffness along its length, responds to specific sound frequencies. Hair cells in the organ of Corti transduce mechanical deflections of their stereocilia into electrical signals sent via the cochlear branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve to the auditory cortex, with inner hair cells providing most sensory input and outer hair cells fine-tuning responses. The vestibular system, though structurally linked to the auditory system, detects balance, gravity, and motion through hair cells in the utricle and saccule (for linear acceleration) and three semicircular canals (for angular acceleration), using displacement of gelatinous structures containing calcium carbonate crystals or cupulae in response to fluid shifts. Vestibular signals travel via the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve to brain regions including the medulla, cerebellum, thalamus, and somatosensory cortex, coordinating balance, spatial orientation, eye movements, and responses such as motion sickness."

For example, bees see near-ultraviolet\nlight in order to locate nectar guides on flowers, and some non-avian reptiles sense infrared light (heat that prey gives off).\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\n1187\nFigure 27.16 In the electromagnetic spectrum, visible light lies between 380 nm and 740 nm. (credit: modification of\nwork by NASA)\nWave amplitude is perceived as luminous intensity, or brightness. The standard unit of intensity of light is the candela,\nwhich is approximately the luminous intensity of a one common candle.\nLight waves travel 299,792 km per second in a vacuum, (and somewhat slower in various media such as air and water), and\nthose waves arrive at the eye as long (red), medium (green), and short (blue) waves. What is termed \u201cwhite light\u201d is light\nthat is perceived as white by the human eye. This effect is produced by light that stimulates equally the color receptors in\nthe human eye. The apparent color of an object is the color (or colors) that the object reflects. Thus a red object reflects the\nred wavelengths in mixed (white) light and absorbs all other wavelengths of light.\nAnatomy of the Eye\nThe photoreceptive cells of the eye, where transduction of light to nervous impulses occurs, are located in the retina\n(shown in Figure 27.17) on the inner surface of the back of the eye. But light does not impinge on the retina unaltered. It\npasses through other layers that process it so that it can be interpreted by the retina (Figure 27.17b). The cornea, the front\ntransparent layer of the eye, and the crystalline lens, a transparent convex structure behind the cornea, both refract (bend)\nlight to focus the image on the retina. The iris, which is conspicuous as the colored part of the eye, is a circular muscular\nring lying between the lens and cornea that regulates the amount of light entering the eye. In conditions of high ambient\nlight, the iris contracts, reducing the size of the pupil at its center. In conditions of low light, the iris relaxes and the pupil\nenlarges.\n1188\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 27.17 (a) The human eye is shown in cross section. (b) A blowup shows the layers of the retina.\nWhich of the following statements about the human eye is true?\na.\nRods detect color, whereas cones detect shades of gray.\nb.\nThe pupil is the location of rods and cones.\nc.\nThe iris adjusts the amount of light coming into the eye.\nd.\nThe fovea is a protective layer on the front of the eye.\nThe main function of the lens is to focus light on the retina and fovea centralis. The lens is dynamic, focusing and re-\nfocusing light as the eye rests on near and far objects in the visual field. The lens is operated by muscles that stretch it flat\nor allow it to thicken, changing the focal length of light coming through it to focus it sharply on the retina. With age comes\nthe loss of the flexibility of the lens, and a form of farsightedness called presbyopia results. Presbyopia occurs because the\nimage focuses behind the retina. Presbyopia is a deficit similar to a different type of farsightedness called hyperopia caused\nby an eyeball that is too short. For both defects, images in the distance are clear but images nearby are blurry. Myopia\n(nearsightedness) occurs when an eyeball is elongated and the image focus falls in front of the retina. In this case, images\nin the distance are blurry but images nearby are clear.\nThere are two types of photoreceptors in the retina: rods and cones, named for their general appearance as illustrated in\nFigure 27.18. Rods are strongly photosensitive and are located in the outer edges of the retina. They detect dim light and\nare used primarily for peripheral and nighttime vision. Cones are weakly photosensitive and are located near the center of\nthe retina. They respond to bright light, and their primary role is in daytime, color vision.\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\n1189\nFigure 27.18 Rods and cones are photoreceptors in the retina. Rods respond in low light and can detect only shades\nof gray. Cones respond in intense light and are responsible for color vision.\nThe fovea is the region in the center back of the eye that is responsible for acute vision. The fovea has a high density of\ncones. When you bring your gaze to an object to examine it intently in bright light, the eyes orient so that the object\u2019s image\nfalls on the fovea. However, when looking at a star in the night sky or other object in dim light, the object can be better\nviewed by the peripheral vision because it is the rods at the edges of the retina, rather than the cones at the center, that\noperate better in low light. In humans, cones far outnumber rods in the fovea.\nReview the anatomical structure (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/eye_diagram) of the eye, clicking on each part to\npractice identification.\nIdentify the part of your eye that could be damaged if your eyes are incapable of focusing an image on the retina.\na.\nlens\nb.\niris\nc.\nrods\nd.\ncones\nTransduction of Light\nThe rods and cones are the site of transduction of light to a neural signal. Both rods and cones contain photopigments. In\nvertebrates, the main photopigment, rhodopsin, has two main parts Figure 27.19): an opsin, which is a membrane protein\n(in the form of a cluster of \u03b1-helices that span the membrane), and retinal\u2014a molecule that absorbs light. When light hits a\nphotoreceptor, it causes a shape change in the retinal, altering its structure from a bent (cis) form of the molecule to its linear\n(trans) isomer. This isomerization of retinal activates the rhodopsin, starting a cascade of events that ends with the closing\nof Na+ channels in the membrane of the photoreceptor. Thus, unlike most other sensory neurons (which become depolarized\nby exposure to a stimulus) visual receptors become hyperpolarized and thus driven away from threshold (Figure 27.20).\n1190\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 27.19 (a) Rhodopsin, the photoreceptor in vertebrates, has two parts: the trans-membrane protein opsin, and\nretinal. When light strikes retinal, it changes shape from (b) a cis to a trans form. The signal is passed to a G-protein\ncalled transducin, triggering a series of downstream events.\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\n1191\nFigure 27.20 When light strikes rhodopsin, the G-protein transducin is activated, which in turn activates\nphosphodiesterase. Phosphodiesterase converts cGMP to GMP, thereby closing sodium channels. As a result, the\nmembrane becomes hyperpolarized. The hyperpolarized membrane does not release glutamate to the bipolar cell.\nTrichromatic Coding\nThere are three types of cones (with different photopsins), and they differ in the wavelength to which they are most\nresponsive, as shown in Figure 27.21. Some cones are maximally responsive to short light waves of 420 nm, so they are\ncalled S cones (\u201cS\u201d for \u201cshort\u201d); others respond maximally to waves of 530 nm (M cones, for \u201cmedium\u201d); a third group\nresponds maximally to light of longer wavelengths, at 560 nm (L, or \u201clong\u201d cones). With only one type of cone, color\nvision would not be possible, and a two-cone (dichromatic) system has limitations. Primates use a three-cone (trichromatic)\nsystem, resulting in full color vision.\nThe color we perceive is a result of the ratio of activity of our three types of cones. The colors of the visual spectrum,\nrunning from long-wavelength light to short, are red (700 nm), orange (600 nm), yellow (565 nm), green (497 nm), blue\n(470 nm), indigo (450 nm), and violet (425 nm). Humans have very sensitive perception of color and can distinguish about\n500 levels of brightness, 200 different hues, and 20 steps of saturation, or about 2 million distinct colors.\n1192\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 27.21 Human rod cells and the different types of cone cells each have an optimal wavelength. However, there\nis considerable overlap in the wavelengths of light detected.\nRetinal Processing\nVisual signals leave the cones and rods, travel to the bipolar cells, and then to ganglion cells. A large degree of processing\nof visual information occurs in the retina itself, before visual information is sent to the brain.\nPhotoreceptors in the retina continuously undergo tonic activity. That is, they are always slightly active even when not\nstimulated by light. In neurons that exhibit tonic activity, the absence of stimuli maintains a firing rate at a baseline; while\nsome stimuli increase firing rate from the baseline, and other stimuli decrease firing rate. In the absence of light, the\nbipolar neurons that connect rods and cones to ganglion cells are continuously and actively inhibited by the rods and cones.\nExposure of the retina to light hyperpolarizes the rods and cones and removes their inhibition of bipolar cells. The now\nactive bipolar cells in turn stimulate the ganglion cells, which send action potentials along their axons (which leave the\neye as the optic nerve). Thus, the visual system relies on change in retinal activity, rather than the absence or presence\nof activity, to encode visual signals for the brain. Sometimes horizontal cells carry signals from one rod or cone to other\nphotoreceptors and to several bipolar cells. When a rod or cone stimulates a horizontal cell, the horizontal cell inhibits more\ndistant photoreceptors and bipolar cells, creating lateral inhibition. This inhibition sharpens edges and enhances contrast\nin the images by making regions receiving light appear lighter and dark surroundings appear darker. Amacrine cells can\ndistribute information from one bipolar cell to many ganglion cells.\nYou can demonstrate this using an easy demonstration to \u201ctrick\u201d your retina and brain about the colors you are observing in\nyour visual field. Look fixedly at Figure 27.22 for about 45 seconds. Then quickly shift your gaze to a sheet of blank white\npaper or a white wall. You should see an afterimage of the Norwegian flag in its correct colors. At this point, close your\neyes for a moment, then reopen them, looking again at the white paper or wall; the afterimage of the flag should continue to\nappear as red, white, and blue. What causes this? According to an explanation called opponent process theory, as you gazed\nfixedly at the green, black, and yellow flag, your retinal ganglion cells that respond positively to green, black, and yellow\nincreased their firing dramatically. When you shifted your gaze to the neutral white ground, these ganglion cells abruptly\ndecreased their activity and the brain interpreted this abrupt downshift as if the ganglion cells were responding now to their\n\u201copponent\u201d colors: red, white, and blue, respectively, in the visual field. Once the ganglion cells return to their baseline\nactivity state, the false perception of color will disappear.\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\n1193\nFigure 27.22 View this flag to understand how retinal processing works. Stare at the center of the flag (indicated by\nthe white dot) for 45 seconds, and then quickly look at a white background, noticing how colors appear.\nHigher Processing\nThe myelinated axons of ganglion cells make up the optic nerves. Within the nerves, different axons carry different qualities\nof the visual signal. Some axons constitute the magnocellular (big cell) pathway, which carries information about form,\nmovement, depth, and differences in brightness. Other axons constitute the parvocellular (small cell) pathway, which carries\ninformation on color and fine detail. Some visual information projects directly back into the brain, while other information\ncrosses to the opposite side of the brain. This crossing of optical pathways produces the distinctive optic chiasma (Greek,\nfor \u201ccrossing\u201d) found at the base of the brain and allows us to coordinate information from both eyes.\nOnce in the brain, visual information is processed in several places, and its routes reflect the complexity and importance of\nvisual information to humans and other animals. One route takes the signals to the thalamus, which serves as the routing\nstation for all incoming sensory impulses except olfaction. In the thalamus, the magnocellular and parvocellular distinctions\nremain intact, and there are different layers of the thalamus dedicated to each. When visual signals leave the thalamus, they\ntravel to the primary visual cortex at the rear of the brain. From the visual cortex, the visual signals travel in two directions.\nOne stream that projects to the parietal lobe, in the side of the brain, carries magnocellular (\u201cwhere\u201d) information. A second\nstream projects to the temporal lobe and carries both magnocellular (\u201cwhere\u201d) and parvocellular (\u201cwhat\u201d) information.\nAnother important visual route is a pathway from the retina to the superior colliculus in the midbrain, where eye\nmovements are coordinated and integrated with auditory information. Finally, there is the pathway from the retina to the\nsuprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The SCN is a cluster of cells that is considered to be the body\u2019s\ninternal clock, which controls our circadian (day-long) cycle. The SCN sends information to the pineal gland, which is\nimportant in sleep/wake patterns and annual cycles.\n1194\nChapter 27 | Sensory Systems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nView this interactive presentation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/sense_of_sight) to review what you have learned about\nhow vision functions.\nExplain how the cornea and sclera are anatomically similar and different.\na.\nBoth are part of the ciliary body.

Humans perceive wavelengths between about 380\u2013740 nm, with wavelength determining hue and amplitude affecting brightness. Light enters the eye through the cornea and lens, which refract it onto the retina, where photoreceptors (rods for dim light and peripheral vision, cones for bright light and color) convert it into neural signals. The fovea, rich in cones, provides sharp central vision. Phototransduction occurs when light changes retinal\u2019s shape in rhodopsin, triggering a cascade that hyperpolarizes photoreceptors, leading to signal transmission via bipolar and ganglion cells. Three types of cones enable trichromatic color vision, with color perceived from the activity ratios among them. Retinal processing, including lateral inhibition via horizontal cells, enhances contrast, and opponent process theory explains phenomena like afterimages. Ganglion cell axons form the optic nerve, with distinct pathways for motion/form (magnocellular) and color/detail (parvocellular) signals, some crossing at the optic chiasma. Visual information is processed in the thalamus and visual cortex, projecting to parietal (\u201cwhere\u201d) and temporal (\u201cwhat\u201d) streams, with additional pathways to the superior colliculus for eye movement coordination and the suprachiasmatic nucleus for circadian rhythm regulation."

The endocrine system plays a role in growth, metabolism, and sexual development. In humans, common\nendocrine system diseases include thyroid disease and diabetes mellitus. In organisms that undergo metamorphosis, the\nprocess is controlled by the endocrine system. The transformation from tadpole to frog, for example, is complex and\nnuanced to adapt to specific environments and ecological circumstances.\nThe study of the endocrine system has led to many medical advances. Now scientists have discovered a hormone that\nmimics the effects of exercise by regulating metabolism and fighting insulin resistance.\n[1] You can read more about this\nexciting discovery at the Science Daily website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32hormoneadv) .\n28.1 | Types of Hormones\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the different types of hormones?\n\u2022\nWhat is the role of hormones in maintaining homeostasis?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nMuch information about the various organ systems of animals is not within the scope for AP\u00ae. The endocrine system,\nhowever, was selected for in-depth study because an animal\u2019s ability to detect, transmit and respond to information is critical\n1.

The endocrine and nervous systems work together to maintain homeostasis and adjust physiological activity\nwhen external or internal environmental conditions change. The nervous system works by generating action potentials along\nneurons; the endocrine system uses chemical messengers called hormones that are released from glands, travel to target\ncells, and elicit a response by the target cell. For AP\u00ae you are not expected to memorize a laundry list of the various\nendocrine glands, their hormones, and the effects of each hormone. You should be able to interpret, however, a diagram that\nshows the activity of a hormonal signal. We will briefly describe a few of these examples in How Hormones Work.\nThere are three types of hormones classified based on molecular structure and properties. (We explored structure/function\nrelationships at the molecular level in the chapter on Biological Macromolecules.) Lipid-derived hormones are lipid-\nsoluble and can diffuse across cell membranes because they are non-polar. Most lipid hormones are derived from\ncholesterol; examples include steroids such as estrogen and testosterone. Because lipid hormones can diffuse across cell\nmembranes, their receptors are located in the cytoplasm of target cells. The amino acid-derived hormones are relatively\nsmall molecules derived from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan; examples include epinephrine, norepinephrine,\nthyroxin, and melatonin. Peptide hormones such as oxytocin and growth hormone consist of polypeptide chains of amino\nacids. Because these hormones are water-soluble and insoluble in lipids, they cannot pass through the plasma membrane of\ncells; their receptors are found on the surface of the target cells.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 and Big Idea 4\nof the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP\u00ae Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide\na transparent foundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and\nAP\u00ae exam questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.\nBig Idea 3\nLiving systems store, retrieve, transmit and respond to information essential to life\nprocesses.\nEnduring\nUnderstanding\n3.D\nCells communicate by generating, transmitting and receiving chemical signals.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n3.D.1 Cell communication processes share common features that reflect a shared\nevolutionary history.\nScience Practice\n6.2 The student can construct explanations of phenomena based on evidence produced\nthrough scientific practices.\nLearning\nObjective\n3.33 The student is able to use representations and models to describe features of a cell\nsignaling pathway.\nBig Idea 4\nBiological systems interact, and these systems and their interactions possess complex\nproperties.\nEnduring\nUnderstanding\n4.A\nInteractions within biological systems lead to complex properties.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n4.A.1 The subcomponents of biological molecules and their sequence determine the\nproperties of that molecule.\nScience Practice\n7.1 The student can connect phenomena and models across spatial and temporal\nscales.\nLearning\nObjective\n4.1 The student is able to explain the connection between the sequence and\nsubcomponents of a biological polymer and its properties.\nMaintaining homeostasis within the body requires the coordination of many different systems and organs. Communication\nbetween neighboring cells, and between cells and tissues in distant parts of the body, occurs through the release of chemicals\ncalled hormones. Hormones are released into body fluids (usually blood) that carry these chemicals to their target cells. At\nthe target cells, which are cells that have a receptor for a signal or ligand from a signal cell, the hormones elicit a response.\nThe cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones make up the endocrine system. Examples of glands of the endocrine\nsystem include the adrenal glands, which produce hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine that regulate responses\nto stress, and the thyroid gland, which produces thyroid hormones that regulate metabolic rates.\nAlthough there are many different hormones in the human body, they can be divided into three classes based on their\n1210\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nchemical structure: lipid-derived, amino acid-derived, and peptide (peptide and proteins) hormones. One of the key\ndistinguishing features of lipid-derived hormones is that they can diffuse across plasma membranes whereas the amino acid-\nderived and peptide hormones cannot.\nLipid-Derived Hormones (or Lipid-soluble Hormones)\nMost lipid hormones are derived from cholesterol and thus are structurally similar to it, as illustrated in Figure 28.2. The\nprimary class of lipid hormones in humans is the steroid hormones. Chemically, these hormones are usually ketones or\nalcohols; their chemical names will end in \u201c-ol\u201d for alcohols or \u201c-one\u201d for ketones. Examples of steroid hormones include\nestradiol, which is an estrogen, or female sex hormone, and testosterone, which is an androgen, or male sex hormone.\nThese two hormones are released by the female and male reproductive organs, respectively. Other steroid hormones include\naldosterone and cortisol, which are released by the adrenal glands along with some other types of androgens. Steroid\nhormones are insoluble in water, and they are transported by transport proteins in blood. As a result, they remain in\ncirculation longer than peptide hormones. For example, cortisol has a half-life of 60 to 90 minutes, while epinephrine, an\namino acid derived-hormone, has a half-life of approximately one minute.\nFigure 28.2 The structures shown here represent (a) cholesterol, plus the steroid hormones (b) testosterone and (c)\nestradiol.\nAmino Acid-Derived Hormones\nThe amino acid-derived hormones are relatively small molecules that are derived from the amino acids tyrosine and\ntryptophan, shown in Figure 28.3. If a hormone is amino acid-derived, its chemical name will end in \u201c-ine\u201d. Examples of\namino acid-derived hormones include epinephrine and norepinephrine, which are synthesized in the medulla of the adrenal\nglands, and thyroxine, which is produced by the thyroid gland. The pineal gland in the brain makes and secretes melatonin\nwhich regulates sleep cycles.\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\n1211\nFigure 28.3 (a) The hormone epinephrine, which triggers the fight-or-flight response, is derived from the amino acid\ntyrosine. (b) The hormone melatonin, which regulates circadian rhythms, is derived from the amino acid tryptophan.\nPeptide Hormones\nThe structure of peptide hormones is that of a polypeptide chain (chain of amino acids). The peptide hormones include\nmolecules that are short polypeptide chains, such as antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin produced in the brain and released\ninto the blood in the posterior pituitary gland. This class also includes small proteins, like growth hormones produced by\nthe pituitary, and large glycoproteins such as follicle-stimulating hormone produced by the pituitary. Figure 28.4 illustrates\nthese peptide hormones.\nSecreted peptides like insulin are stored within vesicles in the cells that synthesize them. They are then released in response\nto stimuli such as high blood glucose levels in the case of insulin. Amino acid-derived and polypeptide hormones are water-\nsoluble and insoluble in lipids. These hormones cannot pass through plasma membranes of cells; therefore, their receptors\nare found on the surface of the target cells.\nFigure 28.4 The structures of peptide hormones (a) oxytocin, (b) growth hormone, and (c) follicle-stimulating hormone\nare shown. These peptide hormones are much larger than those derived from cholesterol or amino acids.\n1212\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nThink About It\nAlthough there are many different hormones in the human body, they can be classified based on their chemical\nstructure. What one factor distinguishes them?\nEndocrinologist\nAn endocrinologist is a medical doctor who specializes in treating disorders of the endocrine glands,\nhormone systems, and glucose and lipid metabolic pathways. An endocrine surgeon specializes in the\nsurgical treatment of endocrine diseases and glands. Some of the diseases that are managed by\nendocrinologists: disorders of the pancreas (diabetes mellitus), disorders of the pituitary (gigantism,\nacromegaly, and pituitary dwarfism), disorders of the thyroid gland (goiter and Graves\u2019 disease), and\ndisorders of the adrenal glands (Cushing\u2019s disease and Addison\u2019s disease).\nEndocrinologists are required to assess patients and diagnose endocrine disorders through extensive use of\nlaboratory tests. Many endocrine diseases are diagnosed using tests that stimulate or suppress endocrine\norgan functioning. Blood samples are then drawn to determine the effect of stimulating or suppressing an\nendocrine organ on the production of hormones. For example, to diagnose diabetes mellitus, patients are\nrequired to fast for 12 to 24 hours. They are then given a sugary drink, which stimulates the pancreas to\nproduce insulin to decrease blood glucose levels. A blood sample is taken one to two hours after the sugar\ndrink is consumed. If the pancreas is functioning properly, the blood glucose level will be within a normal\nrange. Another example is the A1C test, which can be performed during blood screening. The A1C test\nmeasures average blood glucose levels over the past two to three months by examining how well the blood\nglucose is being managed over a long time.\nOnce a disease has been diagnosed, endocrinologists can prescribe lifestyle changes and/or medications\nto treat the disease. Some cases of diabetes mellitus can be managed by exercise, weight loss, and a\nhealthy diet; in other cases, medications may be required to enhance insulin release. If the disease cannot\nbe controlled by these means, the endocrinologist may prescribe insulin injections.\nIn addition to clinical practice, endocrinologists may also be involved in primary research and development\nactivities. For example, ongoing islet transplant research is investigating how healthy pancreas islet cells\nmay be transplanted into diabetic patients. Successful islet transplants may allow patients to stop taking\ninsulin injections.\n28.2 | How Hormones Work\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow do hormones work?\n\u2022\nWhat is the role of different types of hormone receptors?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nMuch of the information in this section is an application of the material we explored in the Cell Communication chapter\nabout cell communication and signaling pathways. Hormones are chemical signals (ligands) that mediate changes in target\ncells by binding to specific receptors. Even though hormones released by endocrine glands can travel long distances through\nthe blood and come into contact with many different cell types, they only affect cells that possess the necessary receptors.\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\n1213\n",

Lipid-derived hormones, primarily steroid hormones such as estrogen, testosterone, aldosterone, and cortisol, are synthesized from cholesterol, are lipid-soluble, can diffuse through cell membranes, have receptors within target cells, and remain in circulation longer due to transport by carrier proteins. Amino acid-derived hormones, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, thyroxine, and melatonin, are small molecules derived from tyrosine or tryptophan, are water-soluble, cannot cross cell membranes, and thus bind to receptors on cell surfaces. Peptide hormones, including oxytocin, antidiuretic hormone, growth hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and insulin, are chains of amino acids or glycoproteins, are also water-soluble, and require surface receptors since they cannot pass through lipid membranes. These hormone types differ in solubility, transport, receptor location, and duration in circulation, but all play crucial roles in regulating homeostasis."

Hormones are chemical signals (ligands) that mediate changes in target\ncells by binding to specific receptors. Even though hormones released by endocrine glands can travel long distances through\nthe blood and come into contact with many different cell types, they only affect cells that possess the necessary receptors.\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\n1213\nDepending on the location of the receptor on the target cell and the chemical structure of the hormone, for example, whether\nor not it is lipid-soluble, hormones can mediate changes directly by binding to intracellular hormone receptors and\nmodulating gene expression (transcription and translation), or indirectly by binding to cell surface receptors and simulating\nsignaling pathways.\nThe hormone binds to its receptor like a key fits a lock. Because a lipid-derived hormone such as a steroid hormone can\ndiffuse across the membrane of the target cell, they bind to intracellular receptors residing in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus.\nThe cell signaling pathways induced by steroid hormones regulate specific genes by acting as transcription regulators. In\nturn, this affects the amount of protein produced. Lipid-derived hormones that are not steroids, for example, vitamin D and\nthyroxin, bind to receptors located in the nucleus of the target cell.\nBecause amino acid-derived hormones and polypeptide hormones are not lipid-soluble, they bind to plasma membrane\nhormone receptors located on the outer surface of the membrane. Unlike steroid hormones, they cannot act directly on\nDNA but activate a signaling pathway; this triggers intracellular activity and carries out the specific effects associated with\nthe hormone. The hormone that initiated the signaling pathway is called a first messenger. In the case of the epinephrine\nsignaling pathway, binding of the amino acid-derived hormone epinephrine to its receptor activates a G-protein which, in\nturn, activates cAMP, a second messenger, ultimately resulting in a cellular response such as the conversion of glycogen to\nglucose.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework. The AP\u00ae Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent\nfoundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP\u00ae exam\nquestions.

In this way, even though hormones\ncirculate throughout the body and come into contact with many different cell types, they only affect cells that possess\nthe necessary receptors. Receptors for a specific hormone may be found on many different cells or may be limited to a\nsmall number of specialized cells. For example, thyroid hormones act on many different tissue types, stimulating metabolic\nactivity throughout the body. Cells can have many receptors for the same hormone but often also possess receptors for\ndifferent types of hormones. The number of receptors that respond to a hormone determines the cell\u2019s sensitivity to that\nhormone, and the resulting cellular response. Additionally, the number of receptors that respond to a hormone can change\nover time, resulting in increased or decreased cell sensitivity. In up-regulation, the number of receptors increases in\nresponse to rising hormone levels, making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity.\nWhen the number of receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels, called down-regulation, cellular activity is\nreduced.\nReceptor binding alters cellular activity and results in an increase or decrease in normal body processes. Depending on the\nlocation of the protein receptor on the target cell and the chemical structure of the hormone, hormones can mediate changes\ndirectly by binding to intracellular hormone receptors and modulating gene transcription, or indirectly by binding to cell\nsurface receptors and stimulating signaling pathways.\nIntracellular Hormone Receptors\nLipid-derived (soluble) hormones such as steroid hormones diffuse across the membranes of the endocrine cell. Once\noutside the cell, they bind to transport proteins that keep them soluble in the bloodstream. At the target cell, the hormones\n1214\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nare released from the carrier protein and diffuse across the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane of cells. The steroid\nhormones pass through the plasma membrane of a target cell and adhere to intracellular receptors residing in the cytoplasm\nor in the nucleus. The cell signaling pathways induced by the steroid hormones regulate specific genes on the cell's DNA.\nThe hormones and receptor complex act as transcription regulators by increasing or decreasing the synthesis of mRNA\nmolecules of specific genes. This, in turn, determines the amount of corresponding protein that is synthesized by altering\ngene expression. This protein can be used either to change the structure of the cell or to produce enzymes that catalyze\nchemical reactions. In this way, the steroid hormone regulates specific cell processes as illustrated in Figure 28.5.\nFigure 28.5 An intracellular nuclear receptor (NR) is located in the cytoplasm bound to a heat shock protein\n(HSP). Upon hormone binding, the receptor dissociates from the heat shock protein and translocates to the\nnucleus. In the nucleus, the hormone-receptor complex binds to a DNA sequence called a hormone response\nelement (HRE), which triggers gene transcription and translation. The corresponding protein product can then\nmediate changes in cell function.\nHeat shock proteins (HSP) are so named because they help refold misfolded proteins. In response to increased\ntemperature (a \u201cheat shock\u201d), heat shock proteins are activated by release from the nuclear receptor/HSP complex. At\nthe same time, transcription of HSP genes is activated. Explain the role of heat shock in refolding misfolded proteins.\na.\nHeat is a stimulus that prevents hormone binding.\nb.\nHeat is a stimulus that facilitates hormone binding.\nc.\nHeat is a stimulus that facilitates dissociation of receptor from HSP directly.\nd.\nHeat is a stimulus that facilitates binding of a hormone-receptor complex to a hormone response element.\nOther lipid-soluble hormones that are not steroid hormones, such as vitamin D and thyroxine, have receptors located in the\nnucleus. The hormones diffuse across both the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope, then bind to receptors in the\nnucleus. The hormone-receptor complex stimulates transcription of specific genes.\nPlasma Membrane Hormone Receptors\nAmino acid derived hormones and polypeptide hormones are not lipid-derived (lipid-soluble) and therefore cannot diffuse\nthrough the plasma membrane of cells. Lipid insoluble hormones bind to receptors on the outer surface of the plasma\nmembrane, via plasma membrane hormone receptors. Unlike steroid hormones, lipid insoluble hormones do not directly\naffect the target cell because they cannot enter the cell and act directly on DNA. Binding of these hormones to a cell surface\nreceptor results in activation of a signaling pathway; this triggers intracellular activity and carries out the specific effects\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\n1215\nassociated with the hormone. In this way, nothing passes through the cell membrane; the hormone that binds at the surface\nremains at the surface of the cell while the intracellular product remains inside the cell. The hormone that initiates the\nsignaling pathway is called a first messenger, which activates a second messenger in the cytoplasm, as illustrated in Figure\n28.6.\nFigure 28.6 The amino acid-derived hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine bind to beta-adrenergic receptors on\nthe plasma membrane of cells. Hormone binding to receptor activates a G-protein, which in turn activates adenylyl\ncyclase, converting ATP to cAMP. cAMP is a second messenger that mediates a cell-specific response. An enzyme\ncalled phosphodiesterase breaks down cAMP, terminating the signal.\nOne very important second messenger is cyclic AMP (cAMP). When a hormone binds to its membrane receptor, a G-\nprotein that is associated with the receptor is activated; G-proteins are proteins separate from receptors that are found in\nthe cell membrane. When a hormone is not bound to the receptor, the G-protein is inactive and is bound to guanosine\ndiphosphate, or GDP. When a hormone binds to the receptor, the G-protein is activated by binding guanosine triphosphate,\nor GTP, in place of GDP. After binding, GTP is hydrolysed by the G-protein into GDP and becomes inactive.\nThe activated G-protein in turn activates a membrane-bound enzyme called adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes\nthe conversion of ATP to cAMP. cAMP, in turn, activates a group of proteins called protein kinases, which transfer a\nphosphate group from ATP to a substrate molecule in a process called phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of a substrate\nmolecule changes its structural orientation, thereby activating it. These activated molecules can then mediate changes in\ncellular processes.\nThe effect of a hormone is amplified as the signaling pathway progresses. The binding of a hormone at a single receptor\ncauses the activation of many G-proteins, which activates adenylyl cyclase. Each molecule of adenylyl cyclase then triggers\nthe formation of many molecules of cAMP. Further amplification occurs as protein kinases, once activated by cAMP, can\ncatalyze many reactions. In this way, a small amount of hormone can trigger the formation of a large amount of cellular\nproduct. To stop hormone activity, cAMP is deactivated by the cytoplasmic enzyme phosphodiesterase, or PDE. PDE\nis always present in the cell and breaks down cAMP to control hormone activity, preventing overproduction of cellular\nproducts.\nThe specific response of a cell to a lipid insoluble hormone depends on the type of receptors that are present on the\ncell membrane and the substrate molecules present in the cell cytoplasm. Cellular responses to hormone binding of a\nreceptor include altering membrane permeability and metabolic pathways, stimulating synthesis of proteins and enzymes,\nand activating hormone release.\n1216\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nActivity\nCreate a representation to describe how a lipid-soluble hormone and a peptide hormone activate different\ncellular responses in a target cell.\n28.3 | Regulation of Body Processes\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow do hormones regulate the excretory system?\n\u2022\nWhat roles do hormones play in the reproductive system?\n\u2022\nHow do hormones regulate metabolism?\n\u2022\nWhat is the role of hormones in different diseases?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe majority of information in this section is illustrative for AP\u00ae.

        "summary": "Hormones act as chemical signals that bind to specific receptors on target cells, affecting only those cells with the appropriate receptors. The location of the receptor and the hormone\u2019s chemical nature determine how the signal is processed: lipid-soluble hormones, like steroids, diffuse through cell membranes and bind to intracellular or nuclear receptors to directly regulate gene transcription and protein synthesis, altering cell structure or function; other lipid-soluble hormones, such as vitamin D and thyroxine, bind to nuclear receptors after crossing the plasma and nuclear membranes. Lipid-insoluble hormones, like amino acid-derived and peptide hormones, cannot pass through the membrane and instead bind to receptors on the cell surface, triggering intracellular signaling pathways via second messengers such as cAMP. These pathways amplify the signal, producing significant cellular effects, and can be terminated by enzymes like phosphodiesterase. A cell\u2019s sensitivity to a hormone depends on both the number and type of receptors, which can change through up-regulation or down-regulation, ultimately influencing processes such as metabolism, membrane permeability, protein synthesis, and enzyme activation."

The key regulatory processes that\nwill be examined here are those affecting the excretory system, the reproductive system, metabolism, blood calcium\nconcentrations, growth, and the stress response.\nHormonal Regulation of the Excretory System\nMaintaining a proper water balance in the body is important to avoid dehydration or over-hydration (hyponatremia). The\nwater concentration of the body is monitored by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which detect the concentration of\nelectrolytes in the extracellular fluid. The concentration of electrolytes in the blood rises when there is water loss caused\nby excessive perspiration, inadequate water intake, or low blood volume due to blood loss. An increase in blood electrolyte\nlevels results in a neuronal signal being sent from the osmoreceptors in hypothalamic nuclei. The pituitary gland has two\ncomponents: anterior and posterior. The anterior pituitary is composed of glandular cells that secrete protein hormones.\nThe posterior pituitary is an extension of the hypothalamus. It is composed largely of neurons that are continuous with the\nhypothalamus.\nThe hypothalamus produces a polypeptide hormone known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is transported to and\nreleased from the posterior pituitary gland. The principal action of ADH is to regulate the amount of water excreted by the\nkidneys. As ADH (which is also known as vasopressin) causes direct water reabsorption from the kidney tubules, salts and\n1218\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nwastes are concentrated in what will eventually be excreted as urine. The hypothalamus controls the mechanisms of ADH\nsecretion, either by regulating blood volume or the concentration of water in the blood. Dehydration or physiological stress\ncan cause an increase of osmolarity above 300 mOsm/L, which in turn, raises ADH secretion and water will be retained,\ncausing an increase in blood pressure. ADH travels in the bloodstream to the kidneys. Once at the kidneys, ADH changes\nthe kidneys to become more permeable to water by stimulating the temporary insertion of water channels, aquaporins, into\nthe kidney tubules. Water moves out of the kidney tubules through the aquaporins, reducing urine volume. The water is\nreabsorbed into the capillaries, lowering blood osmolarity back toward normal. As blood osmolarity decreases, a negative\nfeedback mechanism reduces osmoreceptor activity in the hypothalamus, and ADH secretion is reduced. ADH release can\nbe reduced by certain substances, including alcohol, which can cause increased urine production and dehydration.\nChronic underproduction of ADH or a mutation in the ADH receptor results in diabetes insipidus. If the posterior pituitary\ndoes not release enough ADH, water cannot be retained by the kidneys and is lost as urine. This causes increased thirst, but\nwater taken in is lost again and must be continually consumed. If the condition is not severe, dehydration may not occur,\nbut severe cases can lead to electrolyte imbalances due to dehydration.\nAnother hormone responsible for maintaining electrolyte concentrations in extracellular fluids is aldosterone, a steroid\nhormone that is produced by the adrenal cortex. In contrast to ADH, which promotes the reabsorption of water to maintain\nproper water balance, aldosterone maintains proper water balance by enhancing Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion from\nextracellular fluid of the cells in kidney tubules. Because it is produced in the cortex of the adrenal gland and affects\nthe concentrations of minerals Na+ and K+, aldosterone is referred to as a mineralocorticoid, a corticosteroid that affects\nion and water balance. Aldosterone release is stimulated by a decrease in blood sodium levels, blood volume, or blood\npressure, or an increase in blood potassium levels. It also prevents the loss of Na+ from sweat, saliva, and gastric juice. The\nreabsorption of Na+ also results in the osmotic reabsorption of water, which alters blood volume and blood pressure.\nAldosterone production can be stimulated by low blood pressure, which triggers a sequence of chemical release, as\nillustrated in Figure 28.7. When blood pressure drops, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated. Cells\nin the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which regulates the functions of the nephrons of the kidney, detect this and release renin.\nRenin, an enzyme, circulates in the blood and reacts with a plasma protein produced by the liver called angiotensinogen.\nWhen angiotensinogen is cleaved by renin, it produces angiotensin I, which is then converted into angiotensin II in the\nlungs. Angiotensin II functions as a hormone and then causes the release of the hormone aldosterone by the adrenal cortex,\nresulting in increased Na+ reabsorption, water retention, and an increase in blood pressure. Angiotensin II in addition to\nbeing a potent vasoconstrictor also causes an increase in ADH and increased thirst, both of which help to raise blood\npressure.\nFigure 28.7 ADH and aldosterone increase blood pressure and volume. Angiotensin II stimulates release of these\nhormones. Angiotensin II, in turn, is formed when renin cleaves angiotensinogen.

During puberty in both males and females, the hypothalamus produces gonadotropin-releasing\nhormone (GnRH), which stimulates the production and release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\n1219\nhormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. These hormones regulate the gonads (testes in males and ovaries in females)\nand therefore are called gonadotropins. In both males and females, FSH stimulates gamete production and LH stimulates\nproduction of hormones by the gonads. An increase in gonad hormone levels inhibits GnRH production through a negative\nfeedback loop.\nRegulation of the Male Reproductive System\nIn males, FSH stimulates the maturation of sperm cells. FSH production is inhibited by the hormone inhibin, which is\nreleased by the testes. LH stimulates production of the sex hormones (androgens) by the interstitial cells of the testes and\ntherefore is also called interstitial cell-stimulating hormone.\nThe most widely known androgen in males is testosterone. Testosterone promotes the production of sperm and masculine\ncharacteristics. The adrenal cortex also produces small amounts of testosterone precursor, although the role of this additional\nhormone production is not fully understood.\n1220\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nThe Dangers of Synthetic Hormones\nFigure 28.8 Professional baseball player Jason Giambi publicly admitted to, and apologized for, his use of\nanabolic steroids supplied by a trainer. (credit: Bryce Edwards)\nSome athletes attempt to boost their performance by using artificial hormones that enhance muscle\nperformance. Anabolic steroids, a form of the male sex hormone testosterone, are one of the most widely\nknown performance-enhancing drugs. Steroids are used to help build muscle mass. Other hormones that\nare used to enhance athletic performance include erythropoietin, which triggers the production of red blood\ncells, and human growth hormone, which can help in building muscle mass. Most performance enhancing\ndrugs are illegal for non-medical purposes. They are also banned by many national and international\ngoverning bodies, including many amateur and major league sports\u2019 associations.\nThe side effects of synthetic hormones are often significant and non-reversible, and in some cases, fatal.\nAndrogens produce several complications such as liver dysfunctions prostate gland enlargement, difficulty\nurinating, premature closure of epiphyseal cartilages, testicular atrophy, infertility, and immune system\ndepression. The physiological strain caused by these substances is often greater than what the body can\nhandle, leading to unpredictable and dangerous effects and linking their use to heart attacks, strokes, and\nimpaired cardiac function.\nErythropoietin stimulates red blood cell production and thus increases the amount of oxygen supplied to muscles\nand, consequently, endurance. Explain why erythropoietin might be potentially dangerous if taken to enhance athletic\nperformance.\na.\nErythropoietin increases blood viscosity, which makes it difficult for blood to circulate within the body.\nb.\nErythropoietin decreases blood viscosity, which makes it difficult for blood to circulate within the body.\nc.\nErythropoietin increases the activity of anorexigenic neurons, which makes it difficult for blood to circulate\nwithin the body.\nd.\nErythropoietin increases blood viscosity, which reduces hunger and promotes a feeling of satiety.\nRegulation of the Female Reproductive System\nIn females, FSH stimulates development of egg cells, called ova, which develop in structures called follicles. Follicle cells\nproduce the hormone inhibin, which inhibits FSH production. LH also plays a role in the development of ova, induction of\novulation, and stimulation of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries, as illustrated in Figure 28.9. Estradiol\nand progesterone are steroid hormones that prepare the body for pregnancy. Estradiol produces secondary sex characteristics\nin females, while both estradiol and progesterone regulate the menstrual cycle.\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\n1221\nFigure 28.9 Hormonal regulation of the female reproductive system involves hormones from the hypothalamus,\npituitary, and ovaries.\nIn addition to producing FSH and LH, the anterior portion of the pituitary gland also produces the hormone prolactin (PRL)\nin females. Prolactin stimulates the production of milk by the mammary glands following childbirth. Prolactin levels are\nregulated by the hypothalamic hormones prolactin-releasing hormone (PRH) and prolactin-inhibiting hormone (PIH),\nwhich is now known to be dopamine. PRH stimulates the release of prolactin and PIH inhibits it.\nThe posterior pituitary releases the hormone oxytocin, which stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth. The uterine\nsmooth muscles are not very sensitive to oxytocin until late in pregnancy when the number of oxytocin receptors in the\nuterus peaks. Stretching of tissues in the uterus and cervix stimulates oxytocin release during childbirth. Contractions\nincrease in intensity as blood levels of oxytocin rise via a positive feedback mechanism until the birth is complete. Oxytocin\nalso stimulates the contraction of myoepithelial cells around the milk-producing mammary glands. As these cells contract,\nmilk is forced from the secretory alveoli into milk ducts and is ejected from the breasts in milk ejection (\u201clet-down\u201d) reflex.\nOxytocin release is stimulated by the suckling of an infant, which triggers the synthesis of oxytocin in the hypothalamus\nand its release into circulation at the posterior pituitary.\nHormonal Regulation of Metabolism\nBlood glucose levels vary widely over the course of a day as periods of food consumption alternate with periods of fasting.\nInsulin and glucagon are the two hormones primarily responsible for maintaining homeostasis of blood glucose levels.\nAdditional regulation is mediated by the thyroid hormones.\n1222\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nRegulation of Blood Glucose Levels by Insulin and Glucagon\nCells of the body require nutrients in order to function, and these nutrients are obtained through feeding. In order to manage\nnutrient intake, storing excess intake and utilizing reserves when necessary, the body uses hormones to moderate energy\nstores. Insulin is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, which are stimulated to release insulin as blood glucose levels\nrise (for example, after a meal is consumed). Insulin lowers blood glucose levels by enhancing the rate of glucose uptake and\nutilization by target cells, which use glucose for ATP production. It also stimulates the liver to convert glucose to glycogen,\nwhich is then stored by cells for later use. Insulin also increases glucose transport into certain cells, such as muscle cells and\nthe liver. This results from an insulin-mediated increase in the number of glucose transporter proteins in cell membranes,\nwhich remove glucose from circulation by facilitated diffusion. As insulin binds to its target cell via insulin receptors and\nsignal transduction, it triggers the cell to incorporate glucose transport proteins into its membrane. This allows glucose to\nenter the cell, where it can be used as an energy source. However, this does not occur in all cells: some cells, including those\nin the kidneys and brain, can access glucose without the use of insulin. Insulin also stimulates the conversion of glucose to\nfat in adipocytes and the synthesis of proteins. These actions mediated by insulin cause blood glucose concentrations to fall,\ncalled a hypoglycemic \u201clow sugar\u201d effect, which inhibits further insulin release from beta cells through a negative feedback\nloop.\nThis animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/insulin) describe the role of insulin and the pancreas in diabetes.\nDescribe why Type 1 diabetes is considered an autoimmune disease.\na.\nThe immune system attacks the hypothalamus, which prevents thyroxine production to regulate blood\nglucose.\nb.\nThe immune system attacks cells of the pituitary gland, which prevents insulin production to regulate blood\nglucose.\nc.\nThe immune system attacks beta cells of the pancreas, which prevents insulin production to regulate blood\nglucose.\nd.\nThe immune system attacks beta cells of the pancreas, which prevents insulin production to regulate growth.\nImpaired insulin function can lead to a condition called diabetes mellitus, the main symptoms of which are illustrated\nin Figure 28.10. This can be caused by low levels of insulin production by the beta cells of the pancreas, or by reduced\nsensitivity of tissue cells to insulin. This prevents glucose from being absorbed by cells, causing high levels of blood\nglucose, or hyperglycemia (high sugar). High blood glucose levels make it difficult for the kidneys to recover all the\nglucose from nascent urine, resulting in glucose being lost in urine. High glucose levels also result in less water being\nreabsorbed by the kidneys, causing high amounts of urine to be produced; this may result in dehydration. Over time, high\nblood glucose levels can cause nerve damage to the eyes and peripheral body tissues, as well as damage to the kidneys and\ncardiovascular system. Oversecretion of insulin can cause hypoglycemia, low blood glucose levels. This causes insufficient\nglucose availability to cells, often leading to muscle weakness, and can sometimes cause unconsciousness or death if left\nuntreated.\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\n1223\nFigure 28.10 The main symptoms of diabetes are shown. (credit: modification of work by Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m)\nWhen blood glucose levels decline below normal levels, for example between meals or when glucose is utilized rapidly\nduring exercise, the hormone glucagon is released from the alpha cells of the pancreas. Glucagon raises blood glucose\nlevels, eliciting what is called a hyperglycemic effect, by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen to glucose in skeletal\nmuscle cells and liver cells in a process called glycogenolysis. Glucose can then be utilized as energy by muscle cells and\nreleased into circulation by the liver cells. Glucagon also stimulates absorption of amino acids from the blood by the liver,\nwhich then converts them to glucose. This process of glucose synthesis is called gluconeogenesis. Glucagon also stimulates\nadipose cells to release fatty acids into the blood. These actions mediated by glucagon result in an increase in blood glucose\nlevels to normal homeostatic levels. Rising blood glucose levels inhibit further glucagon release by the pancreas via a\nnegative feedback mechanism. In this way, insulin and glucagon work together to maintain homeostatic glucose levels, as\nshown in Figure 28.11.\n1224\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 28.11 Insulin and glucagon regulate blood glucose levels.\nPancreatic tumors may cause excess secretion of glucagon. Type I diabetes results from the failure of the pancreas to\nproduce insulin. Which of the following statement about these two conditions is true?\na.\nA pancreatic tumor and Type 1 diabetes will have the opposite effects on blood sugar levels.\nb.\nA pancreatic tumor and Type 1 diabetes can both cause hyperglycemia.\nc.\nA pancreatic tumor and Type 1 diabetes can both cause hypoglycemia.\nd.\nBoth pancreatic tumors and Type 1 diabetes result in the inability of cells to take up glucose.\nRegulation of Blood Glucose Levels by Thyroid Hormones\nThe basal metabolic rate, which is the amount of calories required by the body at rest, is determined by two hormones\nproduced by the thyroid gland: thyroxine, also known as tetraiodothyronine or T4, and triiodothyronine, also known as T3.\nThese hormones affect nearly every cell in the body except for the adult brain, uterus, testes, blood cells, and spleen. They\nare transported across the plasma membrane of target cells and bind to receptors on the mitochondria resulting in increased\nATP production. In the nucleus, T3 and T4 activate genes involved in energy production and glucose oxidation. This results\nin increased rates of metabolism and body heat production, which is known as the hormone\u2019s calorigenic effect.\nT3 and T4 release from the thyroid gland is stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced by the\nanterior pituitary. TSH binding at the receptors of the follicle of the thyroid triggers the production of T3 and T4 from a\nglycoprotein called thyroglobulin. Thyroglobulin is present in the follicles of the thyroid, and is converted into thyroid\nhormones with the addition of iodine. Iodine is formed from iodide ions that are actively transported into the thyroid follicle\nfrom the bloodstream. A peroxidase enzyme then attaches the iodine to the tyrosine amino acid found in thyroglobulin. T3\nhas three iodine ions attached, while T4 has four iodine ions attached. T3 and T4 are then released into the bloodstream, with\nT4 being released in much greater amounts than T3. As T3 is more active than T4 and is responsible for most of the effects\nof thyroid hormones, tissues of the body convert T4 to T3 by the removal of an iodine ion. Most of the released T3 and\nT4 becomes attached to transport proteins in the bloodstream and is unable to cross the plasma membrane of cells. These\nprotein-bound molecules are only released when blood levels of the unattached hormone begin to decline. In this way, a\nweek\u2019s worth of reserve hormone is maintained in the blood. Increased T3 and T4 levels in the blood inhibit the release of\nTSH, which results in lower T3 and T4 release from the thyroid.\nThe follicular cells of the thyroid require iodides (anions of iodine) in order to synthesize T3 and T4. Iodides obtained\nfrom the diet are actively transported into follicle cells resulting in a concentration that is approximately 30 times higher\nthan in blood. The typical diet in North America provides more iodine than required due to the addition of iodide to table\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\n1225\nsalt. Inadequate iodine intake, which occurs in many developing countries, results in an inability to synthesize T3 and T4\nhormones. The thyroid gland enlarges in a condition called goiter, which is caused by overproduction of TSH without the\nformation of thyroid hormone. Thyroglobulin is contained in a fluid called colloid, and TSH stimulation results in higher\nlevels of colloid accumulation in the thyroid. In the absence of iodine, this is not converted to thyroid hormone, and colloid\nbegins to accumulate more and more in the thyroid gland, leading to goiter.\nDisorders can arise from both the underproduction and overproduction of thyroid hormones. Hypothyroidism,\nunderproduction of the thyroid hormones, can cause a low metabolic rate leading to weight gain, sensitivity to cold,\nand reduced mental activity, among other symptoms. In children, hypothyroidism can cause cretinism, which can lead to\nmental retardation and growth defects. Hyperthyroidism, the overproduction of thyroid hormones, can lead to an increased\nmetabolic rate and its effects: weight loss, excess heat production, sweating, and an increased heart rate. Graves\u2019 disease is\none example of a hyperthyroid condition.\nHormonal Control of Blood Calcium Levels\nRegulation of blood calcium concentrations is important for generation of muscle contractions and nerve impulses, which\nare electrically stimulated. If calcium levels get too high, membrane permeability to sodium decreases and membranes\nbecome less responsive. If calcium levels get too low, membrane permeability to sodium increases and convulsions or\nmuscle spasms can result.\nBlood calcium levels are regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is produced by the parathyroid glands, as\nillustrated in Figure 28.12. PTH is released in response to low blood Ca2+ levels. PTH increases Ca2+ levels by targeting\nthe skeleton, the kidneys, and the intestine. In the skeleton, PTH stimulates osteoclasts, which causes bone to be reabsorbed,\nreleasing Ca2+ from bone into the blood. PTH also inhibits osteoblasts, reducing Ca2+ deposition in bone. In the intestines,\nPTH increases dietary Ca2+ absorption, and in the kidneys, PTH stimulates reabsorption of the CA2+. While PTH acts\ndirectly on the kidneys to increase Ca2+ reabsorption, its effects on the intestine are indirect. PTH triggers the formation of\ncalcitriol, an active form of vitamin D, which acts on the intestines to increase absorption of dietary calcium. PTH release\nis inhibited by rising blood calcium levels.\nFigure 28.12 Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is released in response to low blood calcium levels. It increases blood\ncalcium levels by targeting the skeleton, the kidneys, and the intestine. (credit: modification of work by Mikael\nH\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m)\nHyperparathyroidism results from an overproduction of parathyroid hormone. This results in excessive calcium being\nremoved from bones and introduced into blood circulation, producing structural weakness of the bones, which can lead\nto deformation and fractures, plus nervous system impairment due to high blood calcium levels. Hypoparathyroidism, the\nunderproduction of PTH, results in extremely low levels of blood calcium, which causes impaired muscle function and may\nresult in tetany (severe sustained muscle contraction).\nThe hormone calcitonin, which is produced by the parafollicular or C cells of the thyroid, has the opposite effect on blood\n1226\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\ncalcium levels as does PTH. Calcitonin decreases blood calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclasts, stimulating osteoblasts,\nand stimulating calcium excretion by the kidneys. This results in calcium being added to the bones to promote structural\nintegrity. Calcitonin is most important in children (when it stimulates bone growth), during pregnancy (when it reduces\nmaternal bone loss), and during prolonged starvation (because it reduces bone mass loss). In healthy nonpregnant, unstarved\nadults, the role of calcitonin is unclear.\nHormonal Regulation of Growth\nHormonal regulation is required for the growth and replication of most cells in the body. Growth hormone (GH), produced\nby the anterior portion of the pituitary gland, accelerates the rate of protein synthesis, particularly in skeletal muscle and\nbones. Growth hormone has direct and indirect mechanisms of action. The first direct action of GH is stimulation of\ntriglyceride breakdown (lipolysis) and release into the blood by adipocytes. This results in a switch by most tissues from\nutilizing glucose as an energy source to utilizing fatty acids. This process is called a glucose-sparing effect. In another\ndirect mechanism, GH stimulates glycogen breakdown in the liver; the glycogen is then released into the blood as glucose.\nBlood glucose levels increase as most tissues are utilizing fatty acids instead of glucose for their energy needs. The GH\nmediated increase in blood glucose levels is called a diabetogenic effect because it is similar to the high blood glucose\nlevels seen in diabetes mellitus.\nThe indirect mechanism of GH action is mediated by insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) or somatomedins, which are a\nfamily of growth-promoting proteins produced by the liver, which stimulates tissue growth. IGFs stimulate the uptake of\namino acids from the blood, allowing the formation of new proteins, particularly in skeletal muscle cells, cartilage cells,\nand other target cells, as shown in Figure 28.13. This is especially important after a meal, when glucose and amino acid\nconcentration levels are high in the blood. GH levels are regulated by two hormones produced by the hypothalamus. GH\nrelease is stimulated by growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and is inhibited by growth hormone-inhibiting\nhormone (GHIH), also called somatostatin.\nFigure 28.13 Growth hormone directly accelerates the rate of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and bones. Insulin-\nlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is activated by growth hormone and also allows formation of new proteins in muscle cells\nand bone. (credit: modification of work by Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m)\nA balanced production of growth hormone is critical for proper development. Underproduction of GH in adults does\nnot appear to cause any abnormalities, but in children it can result in pituitary dwarfism, in which growth is reduced.\nPituitary dwarfism is characterized by symmetric body formation. In some cases, individuals are under 30 inches in height.\nOversecretion of growth hormone can lead to gigantism in children, causing excessive growth. In some documented cases,\nindividuals can reach heights of over eight feet. In adults, excessive GH can lead to acromegaly, a condition in which there\nis enlargement of bones in the face, hands, and feet that are still capable of growth.\nHormonal Regulation of Stress\nWhen a threat or danger is perceived, the body responds by releasing hormones that will ready it for the \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d\nresponse. The effects of this response are familiar to anyone who has been in a stressful situation: increased heart rate, dry\nmouth, and hair standing up.\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\n1227\nFight-or-Flight Response\nInteractions of the endocrine hormones have evolved to ensure the body\u2019s internal environment remains\nstable. Stressors are stimuli that disrupt homeostasis. The sympathetic division of the vertebrate autonomic\nnervous system has evolved the fight-or-flight response to counter stress-induced disruptions of\nhomeostasis. In the initial alarm phase, the sympathetic nervous system stimulates an increase in energy\nlevels through increased blood glucose levels. This prepares the body for physical activity that may be\nrequired to respond to stress: to either fight for survival or to flee from danger.\nHowever, some stresses, such as illness or injury, can last for a long time. Glycogen reserves, which provide\nenergy in the short-term response to stress, are exhausted after several hours and cannot meet long-term\nenergy needs. If glycogen reserves were the only energy source available, neural functioning could not be\nmaintained once the reserves became depleted due to the nervous system\u2019s high requirement for glucose.\nIn this situation, the body has evolved a response to counter long-term stress through the actions of the\nglucocorticoids, which ensure that long-term energy requirements can be met. The glucocorticoids mobilize\nlipid and protein reserves, stimulate gluconeogenesis, conserve glucose for use by neural tissue, and\nstimulate the conservation of salts and water. The mechanisms to maintain homeostasis that are described\nhere are those observed in the human body. However, the fight-or-flight response exists in some form in all\nvertebrates.\nExplain why the fight-or-flight response is advantageous in the short-term but not in the long-term.\na.\nFight-or-flight reduces access to glucose reserves and these get depleted fairly quickly.\nb.\nFight-or-flight reduces access to glycogen reserves and these get depleted fairly quickly.\nc.\nFight-or-flight stimulates access to glucose reserves, but these get depleted fairly quickly.\nd.\nFight-or-flight stimulates access to glycogen reserves, but these get depleted fairly quickly.\nThe sympathetic nervous system regulates the stress response via the hypothalamus. Stressful stimuli cause the\nhypothalamus to signal the adrenal medulla (which mediates short-term stress responses) via nerve impulses, and the\nadrenal cortex, which mediates long-term stress responses, via the hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which\nis produced by the anterior pituitary.\nShort-term Stress Response\nWhen presented with a stressful situation, the body responds by calling for the release of hormones that provide a burst\nof energy. The hormones epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) and norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline)\nare released by the adrenal medulla. How do these hormones provide a burst of energy? Epinephrine and norepinephrine\nincrease blood glucose levels by stimulating the liver and skeletal muscles to break down glycogen and by stimulating\nglucose release by liver cells. Additionally, these hormones increase oxygen availability to cells by increasing the heart rate\nand dilating the bronchioles. The hormones also prioritize body function by increasing blood supply to essential organs such\nas the heart, brain, and skeletal muscles, while restricting blood flow to organs not in immediate need, such as the skin,\ndigestive system, and kidneys. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are collectively called catecholamines.\n1228\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nWatch this Discovery Channel animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/adrenaline) describing the flight-or-flight\nresponse.\nWhen would you receive a burst of energy as your body undergoes a fight-or-flight response.\na.\nincrease in blood calcium levels\nb.\nrelease of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere\nc.\nany threat or life-or-death scenario\nd.\nphysical exercise such as running and swimming\nLong-term Stress Response\nLong-term stress response differs from short-term stress response. The body cannot sustain the bursts of energy mediated\nby epinephrine and norepinephrine for long times. Instead, other hormones come into play. In a long-term stress response,\nthe hypothalamus triggers the release of ACTH from the anterior pituitary gland. The adrenal cortex is stimulated by ACTH\nto release steroid hormones called corticosteroids. Corticosteroids turn on transcription of certain genes in the nuclei of\ntarget cells. They change enzyme concentrations in the cytoplasm and affect cellular metabolism. There are two main\ncorticosteroids: glucocorticoids such as cortisol, and mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone. These hormones target the\nbreakdown of fat into fatty acids in the adipose tissue. The fatty acids are released into the bloodstream for other tissues\nto use for ATP production. The glucocorticoids primarily affect glucose metabolism by stimulating glucose synthesis.\nGlucocorticoids also have anti-inflammatory properties through inhibition of the immune system. For example, cortisone is\nused as an anti-inflammatory medication; however, it cannot be used long term as it increases susceptibility to disease due\nto its immune-suppressing effects.\nMineralocorticoids function to regulate ion and water balance of the body. The hormone aldosterone stimulates the\nreabsorption of water and sodium ions in the kidney, which results in increased blood pressure and volume.\nHypersecretion of glucocorticoids can cause a condition known as Cushing\u2019s disease, characterized by a shifting of fat\nstorage areas of the body. This can cause the accumulation of adipose tissue in the face and neck, and excessive glucose\nin the blood. Hyposecretion of the corticosteroids can cause Addison\u2019s disease, which may result in bronzing of the skin,\nhypoglycemia, and low electrolyte levels in the blood.\nActivity\nSelecting a hormone of your choice, create a visual representation (e.g., diagram) to describe the effect(s)\nof the hormone on a body system, for example, reproductive system, or process, for example, maintaining\nnormal blood glucose levels.\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\n1229\n28.4 | Regulation of Hormone Production\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow is hormone production regulated?\n\u2022\nWhat are examples of different stimuli that control hormone levels in the body?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nHormone production and release are often controlled by negative feedback or positive feedback, although regulation\nby negative feedback is more common. In negative feedback, a stimulus elicits the release of a hormone that produces a\nresponse, and once the response reaches a certain level, it sends a signal that stops additional release of the hormone. In\nthis way, the concentration of hormones in blood is maintained within a narrow range. For example, the anterior pituitary\nstimulates the thyroid gland to release thyroid hormones T3 and T4. Increased levels of these hormones result in feedback\nto the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to inhibit further signaling to the thyroid gland.\nSome hormones are regulated by positive feedback in which the response is amplified; an example of hormone regulation\nby positive feedback is the production of oxytocin during labor and childbirth as uterine contractions cause the production\nand release of more oxytocin.

        "summary": "Hormones regulate numerous body processes, including water and electrolyte balance, reproduction, metabolism, blood calcium levels, growth, and stress responses. In the excretory system, antidiuretic hormone (ADH) conserves water by increasing kidney reabsorption, while aldosterone enhances sodium retention, affecting water balance and blood pressure. Reproductive regulation involves gonadotropins (FSH and LH) controlling gamete production and sex hormone secretion, with additional roles for prolactin in milk production and oxytocin in childbirth and lactation. Metabolism is regulated primarily by insulin and glucagon for blood glucose homeostasis, and thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) for basal metabolic rate, with disorders arising from their over- or underproduction. Blood calcium is balanced by parathyroid hormone (PTH), which raises calcium levels, and calcitonin, which lowers them. Growth hormone (GH) promotes growth directly and via insulin-like growth factors, with imbalances leading to dwarfism, gigantism, or acromegaly. Stress responses involve adrenal medulla catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine) for short-term \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d effects and adrenal cortex corticosteroids (cortisol, aldosterone) for long-term energy management and homeostasis."

A humoral stimulus\nrefers to the control of hormone release in response to changes in extracellular fluids such as blood or the ion concentration\nin the blood. For example, a rise in blood glucose levels triggers the pancreatic release of insulin. Insulin causes blood\nglucose levels to drop, which signals the pancreas to stop producing insulin in a negative feedback loop.\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\n1231\nHormonal Stimuli\nHormonal stimuli refers to the release of a hormone in response to another hormone. A number of endocrine glands release\nhormones when stimulated by hormones released by other endocrine glands. For example, the hypothalamus produces\nhormones that stimulate the anterior portion of the pituitary gland. The anterior pituitary in turn releases hormones that\nregulate hormone production by other endocrine glands. The anterior pituitary releases the thyroid-stimulating hormone,\nwhich then stimulates the thyroid gland to produce the hormones T3 and T4. As blood concentrations of T3 and T4 rise, they\ninhibit both the pituitary and the hypothalamus in a negative feedback loop.\nNeural Stimuli\nIn some cases, the nervous system directly stimulates endocrine glands to release hormones, which is referred to as\nneural stimuli. Recall that in a short-term stress response, the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine are important for\nproviding the bursts of energy required for the body to respond.

For example, the anterior pituitary stimulates the thyroid to produce T3 and T4, and rising levels of these hormones inhibit further stimulation from both the pituitary and hypothalamus. Positive feedback, though less common, amplifies responses, as in oxytocin release during childbirth, where contractions stimulate more hormone secretion. Endocrine glands can be stimulated in three ways: humoral stimuli, where changes in blood composition (e.g., elevated glucose triggering insulin release) regulate hormones; hormonal stimuli, where one hormone stimulates the release of another (e.g., hypothalamic hormones stimulating the pituitary, which in turn stimulates other glands); and neural stimuli, where nerve signals directly trigger hormone release (e.g., sympathetic nervous system activation of the adrenal medulla to release epinephrine and norepinephrine during stress).

Because the neurons can regulate the release of hormones, the nervous and endocrine\nsystems work in a coordinated manner to regulate the body's physiology.\nHypothalamic-Pituitary Axis\nThe hypothalamus in vertebrates integrates the endocrine and nervous systems. The hypothalamus is an endocrine organ\n1232\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nlocated in the diencephalon of the brain. It receives input from the body and other brain areas and initiates endocrine\nresponses to environmental changes. The hypothalamus acts as an endocrine organ, synthesizing hormones and transporting\nthem along axons to the posterior pituitary gland. It synthesizes and secretes regulatory hormones that control the endocrine\ncells in the anterior pituitary gland. The hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal\nmedulla via neuronal control.\nThe pituitary gland, sometimes called the hypophysis or \u201cmaster gland\u201d is located at the base of the brain in the sella\nturcica, a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull, illustrated in Figure 28.15. It is attached to the hypothalamus via a\nstalk called the pituitary stalk (or infundibulum). The anterior portion of the pituitary gland is regulated by releasing or\nrelease-inhibiting hormones produced by the hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary receives signals via neurosecretory\ncells to release hormones produced by the hypothalamus. The pituitary has two distinct regions\u2014the anterior pituitary and\nthe posterior pituitary\u2014which between them secrete nine different peptide or protein hormones. The posterior lobe of the\npituitary gland contains axons of the hypothalamic neurons.\nFigure 28.15 The pituitary gland is located at (a) the base of the brain and (b) connected to the hypothalamus by the\npituitary stalk. (credit a: modification of work by NCI; credit b: modification of work by Gray\u2019s Anatomy)\nAnterior Pituitary\nThe anterior pituitary gland, or adenohypophysis, is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the\nhypothalamus, down along the infundibulum, and to the anterior pituitary. This capillary network is a part of the\nhypophyseal portal system that carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and hormones from the\nanterior pituitary into the circulatory system. A portal system carries blood from one capillary network to another; therefore,\nthe hypophyseal portal system allows hormones produced by the hypothalamus to be carried directly to the anterior pituitary\nwithout first entering the circulatory system.\nThe anterior pituitary produces seven hormones: growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid-stimulating hormone\n(TSH), melanin-stimulating hormone (MSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),\nand luteinizing hormone (LH). Anterior pituitary hormones are sometimes referred to as tropic hormones, because they\ncontrol the functioning of other organs. While these hormones are produced by the anterior pituitary, their production is\ncontrolled by regulatory hormones produced by the hypothalamus. These regulatory hormones can be releasing hormones\nor inhibiting hormones, causing more or less of the anterior pituitary hormones to be secreted. These travel from the\nhypothalamus through the hypophyseal portal system to the anterior pituitary where they exert their effect. Negative\nfeedback then regulates how much of these regulatory hormones are released and how much anterior pituitary hormone is\nsecreted.\nPosterior Pituitary\nThe posterior pituitary is significantly different in structure from the anterior pituitary. It is a part of the brain, extending\ndown from the hypothalamus, and contains mostly nerve fibers and neuroglial cells, which support axons that extend from\nthe hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary and the infundibulum together are referred to as the\nneurohypophysis.\nThe hormones antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, and oxytocin are produced by neurons in the\nhypothalamus and transported within these axons along the infundibulum to the posterior pituitary. They are released\ninto the circulatory system via neural signaling from the hypothalamus. These hormones are considered to be posterior\npituitary hormones, even though they are produced by the hypothalamus, because that is where they are released into the\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\n1233\ncirculatory system. The posterior pituitary itself does not produce hormones, but instead stores hormones produced by the\nhypothalamus and releases them into the blood stream.\nThyroid Gland\nThe thyroid gland is located in the neck, just below the larynx and in front of the trachea, as shown in Figure 28.16. It is a\nbutterfly-shaped gland with two lobes that are connected by the isthmus. It has a dark red color due to its extensive vascular\nsystem. When the thyroid swells due to dysfunction, it can be felt under the skin of the neck.\nFigure 28.16 This illustration shows the location of the thyroid gland.\nThe thyroid gland is made up of many spherical thyroid follicles, which are lined with a simple cuboidal epithelium. These\nfollicles contain a viscous fluid, called colloid, which stores the glycoprotein thyroglobulin, the precursor to the thyroid\nhormones. The follicles produce hormones that can be stored in the colloid or released into the surrounding capillary\nnetwork for transport to the rest of the body via the circulatory system.\nThyroid follicle cells synthesize the hormone thyroxine, which is also known as T4 because it contains four atoms of iodine,\nand triiodothyronine, also known as T3 because it contains three atoms of iodine. Follicle cells are stimulated to release\nstored T3 and T4 by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced by the anterior pituitary. These thyroid hormones\nincrease the rates of mitochondrial ATP production.\nA third hormone, calcitonin, is produced by parafollicular cells of the thyroid either releasing hormones or inhibiting\nhormones. Calcitonin release is not controlled by TSH, but instead is released when calcium ion concentrations in the blood\nrise. Calcitonin functions to help regulate calcium concentrations in body fluids. It acts in the bones to inhibit osteoclast\nactivity and in the kidneys to stimulate excretion of calcium. The combination of these two events lowers body fluid levels\nof calcium.\nParathyroid Glands\nMost people have four parathyroid glands; however, the number can vary from two to six. These glands are located on the\nposterior surface of the thyroid gland, as shown in Figure 28.17. Normally, there is a superior gland and an inferior gland\nassociated with each of the thyroid\u2019s two lobes. Each parathyroid gland is covered by connective tissue and contains many\nsecretory cells that are associated with a capillary network.\n1234\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 28.17 The parathyroid glands are located on the posterior of the thyroid gland. (credit: modification of work by\nNCI)\nThe parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH increases blood calcium concentrations when calcium\nion levels fall below normal. PTH (1) enhances reabsorption of Ca2+ by the kidneys, (2) stimulates osteoclast activity\nand inhibits osteoblast activity, and (3) it stimulates synthesis and secretion of calcitriol by the kidneys, which enhances\nCa2+ absorption by the digestive system. PTH is produced by chief cells of the parathyroid. PTH and calcitonin work in\nopposition to one another to maintain homeostatic Ca2+ levels in body fluids. Another type of cells, oxyphil cells, exist\nin the parathyroid but their function is not known. These hormones encourage bone growth, muscle mass, and blood cell\nformation in children and women.\nAdrenal Glands\nThe adrenal glands are associated with the kidneys; one gland is located on top of each kidney as illustrated in Figure\n28.18. The adrenal glands consist of an outer adrenal cortex and an inner adrenal medulla. These regions secrete different\nhormones.\nFigure 28.18 The location of the adrenal glands on top of the kidneys is shown. (credit: modification of work by NCI)\nAdrenal Cortex\nThe adrenal cortex is made up of layers of epithelial cells and associated capillary networks. These layers form three\ndistinct regions: an outer zona glomerulosa that produces mineralocorticoids, a middle zona fasciculata that produces\nglucocorticoids, and an inner zona reticularis that produces androgens.\nThe main mineralocorticoid is aldosterone, which regulates the concentration of Na+ ions in urine, sweat, pancreas, and\nsaliva. Aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex is stimulated by a decrease in blood concentrations of sodium ions,\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\n1235\nblood volume, or blood pressure, or by an increase in blood potassium levels.\nThe three main glucocorticoids are cortisol, corticosterone, and cortisone. The glucocorticoids stimulate the synthesis of\nglucose and gluconeogenesis (converting a non-carbohydrate to glucose) by liver cells and they promote the release of fatty\nacids from adipose tissue. These hormones increase blood glucose levels to maintain levels within a normal range between\nmeals. These hormones are secreted in response to ACTH and levels are regulated by negative feedback.\nAndrogens are sex hormones that promote masculinity. They are produced in small amounts by the adrenal cortex in both\nmales and females. They do not affect sexual characteristics and may supplement sex hormones released from the gonads.\nAdrenal Medulla\nThe adrenal medulla contains large, irregularly shaped cells that are closely associated with blood vessels. These cells are\ninnervated by preganglionic autonomic nerve fibers from the central nervous system.\nThe adrenal medulla contains two types of secretory cells: one that produces epinephrine (adrenaline) and another that\nproduces norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Epinephrine is the primary adrenal medulla hormone accounting for 75 to 80\npercent of its secretions. Epinephrine and norepinephrine increase heart rate, breathing rate, cardiac muscle contractions,\nblood pressure, and blood glucose levels. They also accelerate the breakdown of glucose in skeletal muscles and stored fats\nin adipose tissue.\nThe release of epinephrine and norepinephrine is stimulated by neural impulses from the sympathetic nervous system.\nSecretion of these hormones is stimulated by acetylcholine release from preganglionic sympathetic fibers innervating the\nadrenal medulla. These neural impulses originate from the hypothalamus in response to stress to prepare the body for the\nfight-or-flight response.\nPancreas\nThe pancreas, illustrated in Figure 28.19, is an elongated organ that is located between the stomach and the proximal\nportion of the small intestine. It contains both exocrine cells that excrete digestive enzymes and endocrine cells that release\nhormones. It is sometimes referred to as a heterocrine gland because it has both endocrine and exocrine functions.\nFigure 28.19 The pancreas is found underneath the stomach and points toward the spleen. (credit: modification of\nwork by NCI)\nThe endocrine cells of the pancreas form clusters called pancreatic islets or the islets of Langerhans, as visible in the\nmicrograph shown in Figure 28.20. The pancreatic islets contain two primary cell types: alpha cells, which produce the\nhormone glucagon, and beta cells, which produce the hormone insulin. These hormones regulate blood glucose levels. As\nblood glucose levels decline, alpha cells release glucagon to raise the blood glucose levels by increasing rates of glycogen\nbreakdown and glucose release by the liver. When blood glucose levels rise, such as after a meal, beta cells release insulin to\nlower blood glucose levels by increasing the rate of glucose uptake in most body cells, and by increasing glycogen synthesis\nin skeletal muscles and the liver. Together, glucagon and insulin regulate blood glucose levels.\n1236\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 28.20 The islets of Langerhans are clusters of endocrine cells found in the pancreas; they stain lighter than\nsurrounding cells. (credit: modification of work by Muhammad T. Tabiin, Christopher P. White, Grant Morahan, and\nBernard E. Tuch; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nPineal Gland\nThe pineal gland produces melatonin. The rate of melatonin production is affected by the photoperiod. Collaterals from the\nvisual pathways innervate the pineal gland. During the day photoperiod, little melatonin is produced; however, melatonin\nproduction increases during the dark photoperiod (night). In some mammals, melatonin has an inhibitory affect on\nreproductive functions by decreasing production and maturation of sperm, oocytes, and reproductive organs. Melatonin is\nan effective antioxidant, protecting the CNS from free radicals such as nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide. Lastly, melatonin\nis involved in biological rhythms, particularly circadian rhythms such as the sleep-wake cycle and eating habits.\nGonads\nThe gonads\u2014the male testes and female ovaries\u2014produce steroid hormones. The testes produce androgens, testosterone\nbeing the most prominent, which allow for the development of secondary sex characteristics and the production of sperm\ncells. The ovaries produce estradiol and progesterone, which cause secondary sex characteristics and prepare the body for\nchildbirth.\nEndocrine Glands and their Associated Hormones\nEndocrine\nGland\nAssociated\nHormones\nEffect\nreleasing and\ninhibiting hormones\nregulate hormone release from pituitary gland; produce oxytocin;\nproduce uterine contractions and milk secretion in females\nHypothalamus\nantidiuretic hormone\n(ADH)\nwater reabsorption from kidneys; vasoconstriction to increase blood\npressure\ngrowth hormone\n(GH)\npromotes growth of body tissues, protein synthesis; metabolic functions\nprolactin (PRL)\npromotes milk production\nthyroid stimulating\nhormone (TSH)\nstimulates thyroid hormone release\nadrenocorticotropic\nhormone (ACTH)\nstimulates hormone release by adrenal cortex, glucocorticoids\nfollicle-stimulating\nhormone (FSH)\nstimulates gamete production (both ova and sperm); secretion of\nestradiol\nPituitary\n(Anterior)\nluteinizing hormone\n(LH)\nstimulates androgen production by gonads; ovulation, secretion of\nprogesterone\nTable 28.1\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\n1237\nEndocrine Glands and their Associated Hormones\nEndocrine\nGland\nAssociated\nHormones\nEffect\nmelanocyte-\nstimulating hormone\n(MSH)\nstimulates melanocytes of the skin increasing melanin pigment\nproduction.\nantidiuretic hormone\n(ADH)\nstimulates water reabsorption by kidneys\nPituitary\n(Posterior)\noxytocin\nstimulates uterine contractions during childbirth; milk ejection;\nstimulates ductus deferens and prostate gland contraction during\nemission\nthyroxine,\ntriiodothyronine\nstimulate and maintain metabolism; growth and development\nThyroid\ncalcitonin\nreduces blood Ca2+ levels\nParathyroid\nparathyroid\nhormone (PTH)\nincreases blood Ca2+ levels\naldosterone\nincreases blood Na+ levels; increase K+ secretion\nAdrenal\n(Cortex)\ncortisol,\ncorticosterone,\ncortisone\nincrease blood glucose levels; anti-inflammatory effects\nAdrenal\n(Medulla)\nepinephrine,\nnorepinephrine\nstimulate fight-or-flight response; increase blood gluclose levels;\nincrease metabolic activities\ninsulin\nreduces blood glucose levels\nPancreas\nglucagon\nincreases blood glucose levels\nPineal gland\nmelatonin\nregulates some biological rhythms and protects CNS from free radicals\nTestes\nandrogens\nregulate, promote, increase or maintain sperm production; male\nsecondary sexual characteristics\nestrogen\npromotes uterine lining growth; female secondary sexual characteristics\nOvaries\nprogestins\npromote and maintain uterine lining growth\nTable 28.1\nOrgans with Secondary Endocrine Functions\nThere are several organs whose primary functions are non-endocrine but that also possess endocrine functions. These\ninclude the heart, kidneys, intestines, thymus, gonads, and adipose tissue.\nThe heart possesses endocrine cells in the walls of the atria that are specialized cardiac muscle cells. These cells release\nthe hormone atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in response to increased blood volume. High blood volume causes the cells\nto be stretched, resulting in hormone release. ANP acts on the kidneys to reduce the reabsorption of Na+, causing Na+ and\nwater to be excreted in the urine. ANP also reduces the amounts of renin released by the kidneys and aldosterone released\nby the adrenal cortex, further preventing the retention of water. In this way, ANP causes a reduction in blood volume and\nblood pressure, and reduces the concentration of Na+ in the blood.\nThe gastrointestinal tract produces several hormones that aid in digestion. The endocrine cells are located in the mucosa\nof the GI tract throughout the stomach and small intestine. Some of the hormones produced include gastrin, secretin, and\ncholecystokinin, which are secreted in the presence of food, and some of which act on other organs such as the pancreas,\ngallbladder, and liver. They trigger the release of gastric juices, which help to break down and digest food in the GI tract.\nWhile the adrenal glands associated with the kidneys are major endocrine glands, the kidneys themselves also possess\nendocrine function. Renin is released in response to decreased blood volume or pressure and is part of the renin-angiotensin-\n1238\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\naldosterone system that leads to the release of aldosterone. Aldosterone then causes the retention of Na+ and water, raising\nblood volume. The kidneys also release calcitriol, which aids in the absorption of Ca2+ and phosphate ions. Erythropoietin\n(EPO) is a protein hormone that triggers the formation of red blood cells in the bone marrow. EPO is released in response\nto low oxygen levels. Because red blood cells are oxygen carriers, increased production results in greater oxygen delivery\nthroughout the body. EPO has been used by athletes to improve performance, as greater oxygen delivery to muscle cells\nallows for greater endurance. Because red blood cells increase the viscosity of blood, artificially high levels of EPO can\ncause severe health risks.\nThe thymus is found behind the sternum; it is most prominent in infants, becoming smaller in size through adulthood. The\nthymus produces hormones referred to as thymosins, which contribute to the development of the immune response.\nAdipose tissue is a connective tissue found throughout the body. It produces the hormone leptin in response to food intake.\nLeptin increases the activity of anorexigenic neurons and decreases that of orexigenic neurons, producing a feeling of satiety\nafter eating, thus affecting appetite and reducing the urge for further eating. Leptin is also associated with reproduction. It\nmust be present for GnRH and gonadotropin synthesis to occur. Extremely thin females may enter puberty late; however, if\nadipose levels increase, more leptin will be produced, improving fertility.\nChapter 28 | The Endocrine System\n1239\nacromegaly\nAddison\u2019s disease\nadenylate cyclase\nadrenal cortex\nadrenal gland\nadrenal medulla\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)\naldosterone\nalpha cell\namino acid-derived hormone\nandrogen\nanterior pituitary\nantidiuretic hormone (ADH)\natrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)\nbeta cell\ncalcitonin\ncolloid\ncorticosteroid\ncortisol\nCushing\u2019s disease\ndiabetes insipidus\ndiabetes mellitus\ndiabetogenic effect\ndown-regulation\nendocrine gland\nepinephrine\nerythropoietin (EPO)\nestrogens\nKEY TERMS\ncondition caused by overproduction of GH in adults\ndisorder caused by the hyposecretion of corticosteroids\nan enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP\nouter portion of adrenal glands that produces corticosteroids\nendocrine glands associated with the kidneys\ninner portion of adrenal glands that produces epinephrine and norepinephrine\nhormone released by the anterior pituitary, which stimulates the adrenal cortex\nto release corticosteroids during the long-term stress response\nsteroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex that stimulates the reabsorption of Na+ from extracellular\nfluids and secretion of K+.\nendocrine cell of the pancreatic islets that produces the hormone glucagon\nhormone derived from amino acids\nmale sex hormone such as testosterone\nportion of the pituitary gland that produces six hormones;

        "summary": "The endocrine glands work together, often in coordination with the nervous system, to regulate the body\u2019s physiology and maintain homeostasis through hormone secretion. The hypothalamus integrates nervous and endocrine functions, controlling the pituitary gland, which in turn regulates other glands. The anterior pituitary produces tropic hormones like GH, PRL, TSH, ACTH, FSH, and LH, while the posterior pituitary stores and releases ADH and oxytocin from the hypothalamus. The thyroid gland secretes T3, T4, and calcitonin to regulate metabolism and calcium levels, whereas the parathyroid glands release PTH to increase blood calcium. The adrenal glands consist of the cortex, which produces mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens, and the medulla, which secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine for the fight-or-flight response. The pancreas has endocrine islets that produce insulin and glucagon to control blood glucose. The pineal gland regulates circadian rhythm via melatonin. Gonads\u2014the testes in males and ovaries in females\u2014produce sex hormones such as androgens, estrogens, and progestins for reproduction and secondary sexual characteristics. Several non-endocrine organs, including the heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, thymus, and adipose tissue, also have endocrine functions, producing hormones like ANP, EPO, calcitriol, gastrin, secretin, thymosins, and leptin to contribute to homeostatic regulation."

(credit:\nmodification of work by Stuart Grout)\nChapter Outline\n29.1: Types of Skeletal Systems\n29.2: Bone\n29.3: Joints and Skeletal Movement\n29.4: Muscle Contraction and Locomotion\nIntroduction\nThe muscular and skeletal systems provide support to the body and allow for a wide range of movement. The bones of the\nskeletal system protect the body\u2019s internal organs and support the weight of the body. The muscles of the muscular system\ncontract and pull on the bones, allowing for movements as diverse as standing, walking, running, and grasping items.\nInjury or disease affecting the musculoskeletal system can be very debilitating. In humans, the most common\nmusculoskeletal diseases worldwide are caused by malnutrition. Ailments that affect the joints are also widespread, such\nas arthritis, which can make movement difficult and\u2014in advanced cases\u2014completely impair mobility. In severe cases in\nwhich the joint has suffered extensive damage, joint replacement surgery may be needed.\nProgress in the science of prosthesis design has resulted in the development of artificial joints, with joint replacement\nsurgery in the hips and knees being the most common. Replacement joints for shoulders, elbows, and fingers are also\navailable. Even with this progress, there is still room for improvement in the design of prostheses. The state-of-the-art\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\n1257\nprostheses have limited durability and therefore wear out quickly, particularly in young or active individuals.\nThe field of robotic prosthesis focuses on prosthetics that are attached directly to the skeleton and can be controlled by the\nmind by using implanted neuromuscular interfaces. You can read more about this exciting research at the Science Daily\nwebsite (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32prosthesis) .\n29.1 | Types of Skeletal Systems\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the characteristics of the different types of animal skeletal systems?\n\u2022\nWhat are the roles of the various components of the human skeletal system?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nMuch of the information in this section is not in scope for AP\u00ae. However, as a student of biology you should have a\nfundamental understanding of how the muscular and skeletal systems work together to provide support and protection while\nallowing for a range of movement. Bones provide a storage area for calcium and phosphorus salts and also are the site of\nblood cell formation. In a later section, knowledge of the nervous system will be used to understand the musculoskeletal\nsystem because muscle contraction depends on neural input. Events occurring at the neuromuscular junction are similar\nto events occurring at synapses between neurons as discussed in the chapter on the nervous system. Humans, and most\nanimals depend on movement for daily activities. From an evolutionary perspective, the transition of animals onto land\nrequired changes in body design as locomotion on land presented a number of new challenges for animals that were adapted\nto movement in the water, such as the effect of gravity and lack of buoyancy. Literally step-by-step, these adaptations\naccumulated. Exploring the evolution of the musculoskeletal system in animals would provide information on this history.\nInformation presented and examples highlighted in this section are not within the scope for AP\u00ae and do not align to the\nCurriculum Framework.\nHydrostatic Skeleton\nA hydrostatic skeleton is a skeleton formed by a fluid-filled compartment within the body, called the coelom. The organs\nof the coelom are supported by the aqueous fluid, which also resists external compression. This compartment is under\nhydrostatic pressure because of the fluid and supports the other organs of the organism. This type of skeletal system is found\nin soft-bodied animals such as sea anemones, earthworms, Cnidaria, and other invertebrates (Figure 29.2).\nFigure 29.2 The skeleton of the red-knobbed sea star (Protoreaster linckii) is an example of a hydrostatic skeleton.\n(credit: \u201cAmada44\u201d/Wikimedia Commons)\nMovement in a hydrostatic skeleton is provided by muscles that surround the coelom. The muscles in a hydrostatic skeleton\ncontract to change the shape of the coelom; the pressure of the fluid in the coelom produces movement. For example,\nearthworms move by waves of muscular contractions of the skeletal muscle of the body wall hydrostatic skeleton, called\nperistalsis, which alternately shorten and lengthen the body. Lengthening the body extends the anterior end of the organism.\nMost organisms have a mechanism to fix themselves in the substrate. Shortening the muscles then draws the posterior\nportion of the body forward. Although a hydrostatic skeleton is well-suited to invertebrate organisms such as earthworms\n1258\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nand some aquatic organisms, it is not an efficient skeleton for terrestrial animals.\nExoskeleton\nAn exoskeleton is an external skeleton that consists of a hard encasement on the surface of an organism. For example, the\nshells of crabs and insects are exoskeletons (Figure 29.3). This skeleton type provides defence against predators, supports\nthe body, and allows for movement through the contraction of attached muscles. As with vertebrates, muscles must cross\na joint inside the exoskeleton. Shortening of the muscle changes the relationship of the two segments of the exoskeleton.\nArthropods such as crabs and lobsters have exoskeletons that consist of 30\u201350 percent chitin, a polysaccharide derivative\nof glucose that is a strong but flexible material. Chitin is secreted by the epidermal cells. The exoskeleton is further\nstrengthened by the addition of calcium carbonate in organisms such as the lobster. Because the exoskeleton is acellular,\narthropods must periodically shed their exoskeletons because the exoskeleton does not grow as the organism grows.\nFigure 29.3 Muscles attached to the exoskeleton of the Halloween crab (Gecarcinus quadratus) allow it to move.\nEndoskeleton\nAn endoskeleton is a skeleton that consists of hard, mineralized structures located within the soft tissue of organisms. An\nexample of a primitive endoskeletal structure is the spicules of sponges. The bones of vertebrates are composed of tissues,\nwhereas sponges have no true tissues (Figure 29.4). Endoskeletons provide support for the body, protect internal organs,\nand allow for movement through contraction of muscles attached to the skeleton.\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\n1259\nFigure 29.4 The skeletons of humans and horses are examples of endoskeletons. (credit: Ross Murphy)\nThe human skeleton is an endoskeleton that consists of 206 bones in the adult. It has five main functions: providing support\nto the body, storing minerals and lipids, producing blood cells, protecting internal organs, and allowing for movement. The\nskeletal system in vertebrates is divided into the axial skeleton (which consists of the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage),\nand the appendicular skeleton (which consists of the shoulders, limb bones, the pectoral girdle, and the pelvic girdle).\nVisit the interactive body (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/virt_skeleton) site to build a virtual skeleton: select \"skeleton\"\nand click through the activity to place each bone.\nList at least three bones that you positioned in the virtual body (in this simulation (http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/\nhumanbody/body/interactives/3djigsaw_02/index.shtml?skeleton) ).\na.\nribs, fibula, sacrum\nb.\nfibula, patella, sternum\nc.\ngliding joint, sacrum, sternum\nd.\nribs, mandible, fibula\nHuman Axial Skeleton\nThe axial skeleton forms the central axis of the body and includes the bones of the skull, ossicles of the middle ear, hyoid\nbone of the throat, vertebral column, and the thoracic cage (ribcage) (Figure 29.5). The function of the axial skeleton is to\nprovide support and protection for the brain, the spinal cord, and the organs in the ventral body cavity. It provides a surface\n1260\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nfor the attachment of muscles that move the head, neck, and trunk, performs respiratory movements, and stabilizes parts of\nthe appendicular skeleton.\nFigure 29.5 The axial skeleton consists of the bones of the skull, ossicles of the middle ear, hyoid bone, vertebral\ncolumn, and rib cage. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nThe Skull\nThe bones of the skull support the structures of the face and protect the brain. The skull consists of 22 bones, which are\ndivided into two categories: cranial bones and facial bones. The cranial bones are eight bones that form the cranial cavity,\nwhich encloses the brain and serves as an attachment site for the muscles of the head and neck. The eight cranial bones are\nthe frontal bone, two parietal bones, two temporal bones, occipital bone, sphenoid bone, and the ethmoid bone. Although the\nbones developed separately in the embryo and fetus, in the adult, they are tightly fused with connective tissue and adjoining\nbones do not move (Figure 29.6).\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\n1261\nFigure 29.6 The bones of the skull support the structures of the face and protect the brain. (credit: modification of work\nby Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nThe auditory ossicles of the middle ear transmit sounds from the air as vibrations to the fluid-filled cochlea. The auditory\nossicles consist of three bones each: the malleus, incus, and stapes. These are the smallest bones in the body and are unique\nto mammals.\nFourteen facial bones form the face, provide cavities for the sense organs (eyes, mouth, and nose), protect the entrances\nto the digestive and respiratory tracts, and serve as attachment points for facial muscles. The 14 facial bones are the nasal\nbones, the maxillary bones, zygomatic bones, palatine, vomer, lacrimal bones, the inferior nasal conchae, and the mandible.\nAll of these bones occur in pairs except for the mandible and the vomer (Figure 29.7).\n1262\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 29.7 The cranial bones, including the frontal, parietal, and sphenoid bones, cover the top of the head. The facial\nbones of the skull form the face and provide cavities for the eyes, nose, and mouth.\nAlthough it is not found in the skull, the hyoid bone is considered a component of the axial skeleton. The hyoid bone lies\nbelow the mandible in the front of the neck. It acts as a movable base for the tongue and is connected to muscles of the jaw,\nlarynx, and tongue. The mandible articulates with the base of the skull. The mandible controls the opening to the airway\nand gut. In animals with teeth, the mandible brings the surfaces of the teeth in contact with the maxillary teeth.\nThe Vertebral Column\nThe vertebral column, or spinal column, surrounds and protects the spinal cord, supports the head, and acts as an\nattachment point for the ribs and muscles of the back and neck. The adult vertebral column comprises 26 bones: the 24\nvertebrae, the sacrum, and the coccyx bones. In the adult, the sacrum is typically composed of five vertebrae that fuse into\none. The coccyx is typically 3\u20134 vertebrae that fuse into one. Around the age of 70, the sacrum and the coccyx may fuse\ntogether. We begin life with approximately 33 vertebrae, but as we grow, several vertebrae fuse together. The adult vertebrae\nare further divided into the 7 cervical vertebrae, 12 thoracic vertebrae, and 5 lumbar vertebrae (Figure 29.8).\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\n1263\nFigure 29.8 (a) The vertebral column consists of seven cervical vertebrae (C1\u20137) twelve thoracic vertebrae (Th1\u201312),\nfive lumbar vertebrae (L1\u20135), the os sacrum, and the coccyx. (b) Spinal curves increase the strength and flexibility of\nthe spine. (credit a: modification of work by Uwe Gille based on original work by Gray's Anatomy; credit b: modification\nof work by NCI, NIH)\nEach vertebral body has a large hole in the center through which the nerves of the spinal cord pass. There is also a notch on\neach side through which the spinal nerves, which serve the body at that level, can exit from the spinal cord. The vertebral\ncolumn is approximately 71 cm (28 inches) in adult male humans and is curved, which can be seen from a side view. The\nnames of the spinal curves correspond to the region of the spine in which they occur. The thoracic and sacral curves are\nconcave (curve inwards relative to the front of the body) and the cervical and lumbar curves are convex (curve outwards\nrelative to the front of the body). The arched curvature of the vertebral column increases its strength and flexibility, allowing\nit to absorb shocks like a spring (Figure 29.8).\nIntervertebral discs composed of fibrous cartilage lie between adjacent vertebral bodies from the second cervical vertebra\nto the sacrum. Each disc is part of a joint that allows for some movement of the spine and acts as a cushion to absorb shocks\nfrom movements such as walking and running. Intervertebral discs also act as ligaments to bind vertebrae together. The\ninner part of discs, the nucleus pulposus, hardens as people age and becomes less elastic. This loss of elasticity diminishes\nits ability to absorb shocks.\nThe Thoracic Cage\nThe thoracic cage, also known as the ribcage, is the skeleton of the chest, and consists of the ribs, sternum, thoracic\nvertebrae, and costal cartilages (Figure 29.9). The thoracic cage encloses and protects the organs of the thoracic cavity,\nincluding the heart and lungs. It also provides support for the shoulder girdles and upper limbs, and serves as the attachment\npoint for the diaphragm, muscles of the back, chest, neck, and shoulders. Changes in the volume of the thorax enable\nbreathing.\nThe sternum, or breastbone, is a long, flat bone located at the anterior of the chest. It is formed from three bones that fuse\nin the adult. The ribs are 12 pairs of long, curved bones that attach to the thoracic vertebrae and curve toward the front of\nthe body, forming the ribcage. Costal cartilages connect the anterior ends of the ribs to the sternum, with the exception of\nrib pairs 11 and 12, which are free-floating ribs.\n1264\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 29.9 The thoracic cage, or rib cage, protects the heart and the lungs. (credit: modification of work by NCI, NIH)\nHuman Appendicular Skeleton\nThe appendicular skeleton is composed of the bones of the upper limbs (which function to grasp and manipulate objects)\nand the lower limbs (which permit locomotion). It also includes the pectoral girdle, or shoulder girdle, that attaches the\nupper limbs to the body, and the pelvic girdle that attaches the lower limbs to the body (Figure 29.10).\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\n1265\nFigure 29.10 The appendicular skeleton is composed of the bones of the pectoral limbs (arm, forearm, hand), the\npelvic limbs (thigh, leg, foot), the pectoral girdle, and the pelvic girdle. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz\nVillareal)\nThe Pectoral Girdle\nThe pectoral girdle bones provide the points of attachment of the upper limbs to the axial skeleton. The human pectoral\ngirdle consists of the clavicle (or collarbone) in the anterior, and the scapula (or shoulder blades) in the posterior (Figure\n29.11).\nFigure 29.11 (a) The pectoral girdle in primates consists of the clavicles and scapulae. (b) The posterior view reveals\nthe spine of the scapula to which muscle attaches.\n1266\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nThe clavicles are S-shaped bones that position the arms on the body. The clavicles lie horizontally across the front of the\nthorax (chest) just above the first rib. These bones are fairly fragile and are susceptible to fractures. For example, a fall\nwith the arms outstretched causes the force to be transmitted to the clavicles, which can break if the force is excessive. The\nclavicle articulates with the sternum and the scapula.\nThe scapulae are flat, triangular bones that are located at the back of the pectoral girdle. They support the muscles crossing\nthe shoulder joint. A ridge, called the spine, runs across the back of the scapula and can easily be felt through the skin\n(Figure 29.11). The spine of the scapula is a good example of a bony protrusion that facilitates a broad area of attachment\nfor muscles to bone.\nThe Upper Limb\nThe upper limb contains 30 bones in three regions: the arm (shoulder to elbow), the forearm (ulna and radius), and the wrist\nand hand (Figure 29.12).\nFigure 29.12 The upper limb consists of the humerus of the upper arm, the radius and ulna of the forearm, eight bones\nof the carpus, five bones of the metacarpus, and 14 bones of the phalanges.\nAn articulation is any place at which two bones are joined. The humerus is the largest and longest bone of the upper limb\nand the only bone of the arm. It articulates with the scapula at the shoulder and with the forearm at the elbow. The forearm\nextends from the elbow to the wrist and consists of two bones: the ulna and the radius. The radius is located along the\nlateral (thumb) side of the forearm and articulates with the humerus at the elbow. The ulna is located on the medial aspect\n(pinky-finger side) of the forearm. It is longer than the radius. The ulna articulates with the humerus at the elbow. The radius\nand ulna also articulate with the carpal bones and with each other, which in vertebrates enables a variable degree of rotation\nof the carpus with respect to the long axis of the limb. The hand includes the eight bones of the carpus (wrist), the five\nbones of the metacarpus (palm), and the 14 bones of the phalanges (digits). Each digit consists of three phalanges, except\nfor the thumb, when present, which has only two.\nThe Pelvic Girdle\nThe pelvic girdle attaches to the lower limbs of the axial skeleton. Because it is responsible for bearing the weight of the\nbody and for locomotion, the pelvic girdle is securely attached to the axial skeleton by strong ligaments. It also has deep\nsockets with robust ligaments to securely attach the femur to the body. The pelvic girdle is further strengthened by two large\nhip bones. In adults, the hip bones, or coxal bones, are formed by the fusion of three pairs of bones: the ilium, ischium, and\npubis. The pelvis joins together in the anterior of the body at a joint called the pubic symphysis and with the bones of the\nsacrum at the posterior of the body.\nThe female pelvis is slightly different from the male pelvis. Over generations of evolution, females with a wider pubic\nangle and larger diameter pelvic canal reproduced more successfully. Therefore, their offspring also had pelvic anatomy that\nenabled successful childbirth (Figure 29.13).\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\n1267\nFigure 29.13 To adapt to reproductive fitness, the (a) female pelvis is lighter, wider, shallower, and has a broader angle\nbetween the pubic bones than (b) the male pelvis.\nThe Lower Limb\nThe lower limb consists of the thigh, the leg, and the foot. The bones of the lower limb are the femur (thigh bone), patella\n(kneecap), tibia and fibula (bones of the leg), tarsals (bones of the ankle), and metatarsals and phalanges (bones of the foot)\n(Figure 29.14). The bones of the lower limbs are thicker and stronger than the bones of the upper limbs because of the need\nto support the entire weight of the body and the resulting forces from locomotion. In addition to evolutionary fitness, the\nbones of an individual will respond to forces exerted upon them.\nFigure 29.14 The lower limb consists of the thigh (femur), kneecap (patella), leg (tibia and fibula), ankle (tarsals), and\nfoot (metatarsals and phalanges) bones.\nThe femur, or thighbone, is the longest, heaviest, and strongest bone in the body. The femur and pelvis form the hip joint at\nthe proximal end. At the distal end, the femur, tibia, and patella form the knee joint. The patella, or kneecap, is a triangular\nbone that lies anterior to the knee joint. The patella is embedded in the tendon of the femoral extensors (quadriceps). It\nimproves knee extension by reducing friction. The tibia, or shinbone, is a large bone of the leg that is located directly below\nthe knee. The tibia articulates with the femur at its proximal end, with the fibula and the tarsal bones at its distal end. It is\nthe second largest bone in the human body and is responsible for transmitting the weight of the body from the femur to the\nfoot. The fibula, or calf bone, parallels and articulates with the tibia. It does not articulate with the femur and does not bear\nweight. The fibula acts as a site for muscle attachment and forms the lateral part of the ankle joint.\nThe tarsals are the seven bones of the ankle. The ankle transmits the weight of the body from the tibia and the fibula to the\n1268\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nfoot. The metatarsals are the five bones of the foot. The phalanges are the 14 bones of the toes. Each toe consists of three\nphalanges, except for the big toe that has only two (Figure 29.15). Variations exist in other species; for example, the horse\u2019s\nmetacarpals and metatarsals are oriented vertically and do not make contact with the substrate.\nFigure 29.15 This drawing shows the bones of the human foot and ankle, including the metatarsals and the phalanges.\nEvolution of Body Design for Locomotion on Land\nThe transition of vertebrates onto land required a number of changes in body design, as movement on\nland presents a number of challenges for animals that are adapted to movement in water. The buoyancy\nof water provides a certain amount of lift, and a common form of movement by fish is lateral undulations\nof the entire body. This back and forth movement pushes the body against the water, creating forward\nmovement. In most fish, the muscles of paired fins attach to girdles within the body, allowing for some\ncontrol of locomotion. As certain fish began moving onto land, they retained their lateral undulation form of\nlocomotion (anguilliform). However, instead of pushing against water, their fins or flippers became points of\ncontact with the ground, around which they rotated their bodies.\nThe effect of gravity and the lack of buoyancy on land meant that body weight was suspended on the limbs,\nleading to increased strengthening and ossification of the limbs. The effect of gravity also required changes\nto the axial skeleton. Lateral undulations of land animal vertebral columns cause torsional strain. A firmer,\nmore ossified vertebral column became common in terrestrial tetrapods because it reduces strain while\nproviding the strength needed to support the body\u2019s weight. In later tetrapods, the vertebrae began allowing\nfor vertical motion rather than lateral flexion. Another change in the axial skeleton was the loss of a direct\nattachment between the pectoral girdle and the head. This reduced the jarring to the head caused by the\nimpact of the limbs on the ground. The vertebrae of the neck also evolved to allow movement of the head\nindependently of the body.\nThe appendicular skeleton of land animals is also different from aquatic animals. The shoulders attach to the\npectoral girdle through muscles and connective tissue, thus reducing the jarring of the skull. Because of a\nlateral undulating vertebral column, in early tetrapods, the limbs were splayed out to the side and movement\noccurred by performing \u201cpush-ups.\u201d The vertebrae of these animals had to move side-to-side in a similar\nmanner to fish and reptiles. This type of motion requires large muscles to move the limbs toward the midline;\nit was almost like walking while doing push-ups, and it is not an efficient use of energy. Later tetrapods have\ntheir limbs placed under their bodies, so that each stride requires less force to move forward. This resulted\nin decreased adductor muscle size and an increased range of motion of the scapulae. This also restricts\nmovement primarily to one plane, creating forward motion rather than moving the limbs upward as well as\nforward. The femur and humerus were also rotated, so that the ends of the limbs and digits were pointed\nforward, in the direction of motion, rather than out to the side. By placement underneath the body, limbs can\nswing forward like a pendulum to produce a stride that is more efficient for moving over land.\nWhich of the following changes evolved in the animal skeletal system as animals moved from water to land?\na.\ndecreased ossification of bones\nb.\nincreased attachment between pectoral girdle and head\nc.\nrotation of femur and humerus to point to the side\nd.\nplacement of limbs under the body\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\n1269\n29.2 | Bone\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are examples of the different types of bones and their functions in the human skeleton?\n\u2022\nWhat are the roles of the different cell types and tissue types in bone?\n\u2022\nHow do bones develop, grow, and undergo remodeling and repair?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe information in this section is not within the scope for AP\u00ae and does not align with the curriculum framework.

        "summary": "There are three main types of skeletal systems in animals: hydrostatic, exoskeleton, and endoskeleton. A hydrostatic skeleton, found in soft-bodied invertebrates like earthworms and sea anemones, consists of a fluid-filled coelom that provides support and enables movement via muscle contractions that change the body's shape. An exoskeleton is an external, hard structure made of materials like chitin (and sometimes strengthened with calcium carbonate) that supports the body, protects internal organs, and facilitates movement through muscle attachment, but must be periodically shed for growth. An endoskeleton, found in vertebrates and some invertebrates, is an internal framework of mineralized structures that supports the body, protects organs, produces blood cells, stores minerals, and enables movement. In humans, the endoskeleton is divided into the axial skeleton\u2014which includes the skull, vertebral column, and ribcage\u2014and the appendicular skeleton\u2014which includes the limbs and girdles. The axial skeleton provides central support and protection for vital organs, while the appendicular skeleton facilitates locomotion and manipulation. Human skeletal adaptations have evolved to meet the challenges of terrestrial life, including stronger, more ossified bones, repositioned limbs under the body, and structural modifications that improve locomotion efficiency on land."

Calcification is the\nprocess of deposition of mineral salts on the collagen fiber matrix that crystallizes and hardens the tissue. The process of\ncalcification only occurs in the presence of collagen fibers.\nThe bones of the human skeleton are classified by their shape: long bones, short bones, flat bones, sutural bones, sesamoid\nbones, and irregular bones (Figure 29.16).\n1270\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 29.16 Shown are different types of bones: flat, irregular, long, short, and sesamoid.\nLong bones are longer than they are wide and have a shaft and two ends. The diaphysis, or central shaft, contains bone\nmarrow in a marrow cavity. The rounded ends, the epiphyses, are covered with articular cartilage and are filled with red\nbone marrow, which produces blood cells (Figure 29.17). Most of the limb bones are long bones\u2014for example, the femur,\ntibia, ulna, and radius. Exceptions to this include the patella and the bones of the wrist and ankle.\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\n1271\nFigure 29.17 The long bone is covered by articular cartilage at either end and contains bone marrow (shown in yellow\nin this illustration) in the marrow cavity.\nShort bones, or cuboidal bones, are bones that are the same width and length, giving them a cube-like shape. For example,\nthe bones of the wrist (carpals) and ankle (tarsals) are short bones (Figure 29.16).\nFlat bones are thin and relatively broad bones that are found where extensive protection of organs is required or where\nbroad surfaces of muscle attachment are required. Examples of flat bones are the sternum (breast bone), ribs, scapulae\n(shoulder blades), and the roof of the skull (Figure 29.16).\nIrregular bones are bones with complex shapes. These bones may have short, flat, notched, or ridged surfaces. Examples\nof irregular bones are the vertebrae, hip bones, and several skull bones.\nSesamoid bones are small, flat bones and are shaped similarly to a sesame seed. The patellae are sesamoid bones (Figure\n29.18). Sesamoid bones develop inside tendons and may be found near joints at the knees, hands, and feet.\n1272\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 29.18 The patella of the knee is an example of a sesamoid bone.\nSutural bones are small, flat, irregularly shaped bones. They may be found between the flat bones of the skull. They vary\nin number, shape, size, and position.\nBone Tissue\nBones are considered organs because they contain various types of tissue, such as blood, connective tissue, nerves, and bone\ntissue. Osteocytes, the living cells of bone tissue, form the mineral matrix of bones. There are two types of bone tissue:\ncompact and spongy.\nCompact Bone Tissue\nCompact bone (or cortical bone) forms the hard external layer of all bones and surrounds the medullary cavity, or bone\nmarrow. It provides protection and strength to bones. Compact bone tissue consists of units called osteons or Haversian\nsystems. Osteons are cylindrical structures that contain a mineral matrix and living osteocytes connected by canaliculi,\nwhich transport blood. They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone. Each osteon consists of lamellae, which are\nlayers of compact matrix that surround a central canal called the Haversian canal. The Haversian canal (osteonic canal)\ncontains the bone\u2019s blood vessels and nerve fibers (Figure 29.19). Osteons in compact bone tissue are aligned in the same\ndirection along lines of stress and help the bone resist bending or fracturing. Therefore, compact bone tissue is prominent in\nareas of bone at which stresses are applied in only a few directions.\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\n1273\nFigure 29.19 Compact bone tissue consists of osteons that are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone, and\nthe Haversian canal that contains the bone\u2019s blood vessels and nerve fibers. The inner layer of bones consists\nof spongy bone tissue. The small dark ovals in the osteon represent the living osteocytes. (credit: modification of\nwork by NCI, NIH)\nSpongy Bone Tissue\nWhereas compact bone tissue forms the outer layer of all bones, spongy bone or cancellous bone forms the inner layer of all\nbones. Spongy bone tissue does not contain osteons that constitute compact bone tissue. Instead, it consists of trabeculae,\nwhich are lamellae that are arranged as rods or plates. Red bone marrow is found between the trabuculae. Blood vessels\nwithin this tissue deliver nutrients to osteocytes and remove waste. The red bone marrow of the femur and the interior of\nother large bones, such as the ileum, forms blood cells.\nSpongy bone reduces the density of bone and allows the ends of long bones to compress as the result of stresses applied\nto the bone. Spongy bone is prominent in areas of bones that are not heavily stressed or where stresses arrive from many\ndirections. The epiphyses of bones, such as the neck of the femur, are subject to stress from many directions. Imagine laying\na heavy framed picture flat on the floor. You could hold up one side of the picture with a toothpick if the toothpick was\nperpendicular to the floor and the picture. Now drill a hole and stick the toothpick into the wall to hang up the picture. In\nthis case, the function of the toothpick is to transmit the downward pressure of the picture to the wall. The force on the\npicture is straight down to the floor, but the force on the toothpick is both the picture wire pulling down and the bottom of\nthe hole in the wall pushing up. The toothpick will break off right at the wall.\nThe neck of the femur is horizontal like the toothpick in the wall. The weight of the body pushes it down near the joint, but\nthe vertical diaphysis of the femur pushes it up at the other end. The neck of the femur must be strong enough to transfer\nthe downward force of the body weight horizontally to the vertical shaft of the femur (Figure 29.20).\n1274\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 29.20 Trabeculae in spongy bone are arranged such that one side of the bone bears tension and the other\nwithstands compression.\nView micrographs (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/muscle_tissue) of musculoskeletal tissues as you review the anatomy.\nWhich type of connective tissue lacks collagen fibers?\na.\nblood\nb.\nloose connective tissue\nc.\ncartilage\nd.\nbone\nCell Types in Bones\nBone consists of four types of cells: osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes, and osteoprogenitor cells. Osteoblasts are bone\ncells that are responsible for bone formation. Osteoblasts synthesize and secrete the organic part and inorganic part of the\nextracellular matrix of bone tissue, and collagen fibers. Osteoblasts become trapped in these secretions and differentiate\ninto less active osteocytes. Osteoclasts are large bone cells with up to 50 nuclei. They remove bone structure by releasing\nlysosomal enzymes and acids that dissolve the bony matrix. These minerals, released from bones into the blood, help\nregulate calcium concentrations in body fluids. Bone may also be resorbed for remodeling, if the applied stresses have\nchanged. Osteocytes are mature bone cells and are the main cells in bony connective tissue; these cells cannot divide.\nOsteocytes maintain normal bone structure by recycling the mineral salts in the bony matrix. Osteoprogenitor cells are\nsquamous stem cells that divide to produce daughter cells that differentiate into osteoblasts. Osteoprogenitor cells are\nimportant in the repair of fractures.\nDevelopment of Bone\nOssification, or osteogenesis, is the process of bone formation by osteoblasts. Ossification is distinct from the process\nof calcification; whereas calcification takes place during the ossification of bones, it can also occur in other tissues.\nOssification begins approximately six weeks after fertilization in an embryo. Before this time, the embryonic skeleton\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\n1275\nconsists entirely of fibrous membranes and hyaline cartilage. The development of bone from fibrous membranes is\ncalled intramembranous ossification; development from hyaline cartilage is called endochondral ossification. Bone growth\ncontinues until approximately age 25. Bones can grow in thickness throughout life, but after age 25, ossification functions\nprimarily in bone remodeling and repair.\nIntramembranous Ossification\nIntramembranous ossification is the process of bone development from fibrous membranes. It is involved in the formation\nof the flat bones of the skull, the mandible, and the clavicles. Ossification begins as mesenchymal cells form a template\nof the future bone. They then differentiate into osteoblasts at the ossification center. Osteoblasts secrete the extracellular\nmatrix and deposit calcium, which hardens the matrix. The non-mineralized portion of the bone or osteoid continues to form\naround blood vessels, forming spongy bone. Connective tissue in the matrix differentiates into red bone marrow in the fetus.\nThe spongy bone is remodeled into a thin layer of compact bone on the surface of the spongy bone.\nEndochondral Ossification\nEndochondral ossification is the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage. All of the bones of the body, except\nfor the flat bones of the skull, mandible, and clavicles, are formed through endochondral ossification.\nIn long bones, chondrocytes form a template of the hyaline cartilage diaphysis. Responding to complex developmental\nsignals, the matrix begins to calcify. This calcification prevents diffusion of nutrients into the matrix, resulting in\nchondrocytes dying and the opening up of cavities in the diaphysis cartilage. Blood vessels invade the cavities, and\nosteoblasts and osteoclasts modify the calcified cartilage matrix into spongy bone. Osteoclasts then break down some of the\nspongy bone to create a marrow, or medullary, cavity in the center of the diaphysis. Dense, irregular connective tissue forms\na sheath (periosteum) around the bones. The periosteum assists in attaching the bone to surrounding tissues, tendons, and\nligaments. The bone continues to grow and elongate as the cartilage cells at the epiphyses divide.\nIn the last stage of prenatal bone development, the centers of the epiphyses begin to calcify. Secondary ossification centers\nform in the epiphyses as blood vessels and osteoblasts enter these areas and convert hyaline cartilage into spongy bone. Until\nadolescence, hyaline cartilage persists at the epiphyseal plate (growth plate), which is the region between the diaphysis and\nepiphysis that is responsible for the lengthwise growth of long bones (Figure 29.21).\nFigure 29.21 Endochondral ossification is the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage. The periosteum\nis the connective tissue on the outside of bone that acts as the interface between bone, blood vessels, tendons, and\nligaments.\nGrowth of Bone\nLong bones continue to lengthen, potentially until adolescence, through the addition of bone tissue at the epiphyseal plate.\nThey also increase in width through appositional growth.\nLengthening of Long Bones\nChondrocytes on the epiphyseal side of the epiphyseal plate divide; one cell remains undifferentiated near the epiphysis,\nand one cell moves toward the diaphysis. The cells, which are pushed from the epiphysis, mature and are destroyed by\ncalcification. This process replaces cartilage with bone on the diaphyseal side of the plate, resulting in a lengthening of the\nbone.\nLong bones stop growing at around the age of 18 in females and the age of 21 in males in a process called epiphyseal plate\nclosure. During this process, cartilage cells stop dividing and all of the cartilage is replaced by bone. The epiphyseal plate\nfades, leaving a structure called the epiphyseal line or epiphyseal remnant, and the epiphysis and diaphysis fuse.\n1276\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nThickening of Long Bones\nAppositional growth is the increase in the diameter of bones by the addition of bony tissue at the surface of bones.\nOsteoblasts at the bone surface secrete bone matrix, and osteoclasts on the inner surface break down bone. The osteoblasts\ndifferentiate into osteocytes. A balance between these two processes allows the bone to thicken without becoming too heavy.\nBone Remodeling and Repair\nBone renewal continues after birth into adulthood. Bone remodeling is the replacement of old bone tissue by new bone\ntissue. It involves the processes of bone deposition by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts. Normal bone growth\nrequires vitamins D, C, and A, plus minerals such as calcium, phosphorous, and magnesium. Hormones such as parathyroid\nhormone, growth hormone, and calcitonin are also required for proper bone growth and maintenance.\nBone turnover rates are quite high, with five to seven percent of bone mass being recycled every week. Differences in\nturnover rate exist in different areas of the skeleton and in different areas of a bone. For example, the bone in the head of\nthe femur may be fully replaced every six months, whereas the bone along the shaft is altered much more slowly.\nBone remodeling allows bones to adapt to stresses by becoming thicker and stronger when subjected to stress. Bones that\nare not subject to normal stress, for example when a limb is in a cast, will begin to lose mass. A fractured or broken bone\nundergoes repair through four stages:\n1.\nBlood vessels in the broken bone tear and hemorrhage, resulting in the formation of clotted blood, or a hematoma, at\nthe site of the break. The severed blood vessels at the broken ends of the bone are sealed by the clotting process, and\nbone cells that are deprived of nutrients begin to die.\n2.\nWithin days of the fracture, capillaries grow into the hematoma, and phagocytic cells begin to clear away the dead\ncells. Though fragments of the blood clot may remain, fibroblasts and osteoblasts enter the area and begin to reform\nbone. Fibroblasts produce collagen fibers that connect the broken bone ends, and osteoblasts start to form spongy bone.\nThe repair tissue between the broken bone ends is called the fibrocartilaginous callus, as it is composed of both hyaline\nand fibrocartilage (Figure 29.22). Some bone spicules may also appear at this point.\n3.\nThe fibrocartilaginous callus is converted into a bony callus of spongy bone. It takes about two months for the broken\nbone ends to be firmly joined together after the fracture. This is similar to the endochondral formation of bone, as\ncartilage becomes ossified; osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and bone matrix are present.\n4.\nThe bony callus is then remodelled by osteoclasts and osteoblasts, with excess material on the exterior of the bone and\nwithin the medullary cavity being removed. Compact bone is added to create bone tissue that is similar to the original,\nunbroken bone. This remodeling can take many months, and the bone may remain uneven for years.\nFigure 29.22 After this bone is set, a callus will knit the two ends together.

        "summary": "Bone, or osseous tissue, is a connective tissue composed of specialized cells within a mineralized collagen matrix, classified by shape into long, short, flat, irregular, sesamoid, and sutural bones, each adapted for specific structural or protective roles. Bone tissue occurs as compact bone, forming the dense outer layer composed of osteons for strength along stress lines, and spongy bone, forming the inner layer with trabeculae housing red marrow for blood cell production and adapting to multidirectional stresses. Four cell types are involved in bone function: osteoblasts (form bone matrix), osteoclasts (break down bone), osteocytes (maintain bone), and osteoprogenitor cells (stem cells for repair). Bone develops via ossification\u2014intramembranous ossification forming flat bones from fibrous membranes, and endochondral ossification forming most other bones from hyaline cartilage\u2014with growth occurring in length at the epiphyseal plates until early adulthood and in thickness through appositional growth. Bone remodeling, a lifelong balance of deposition and resorption regulated by nutrients and hormones, adapts bone to stress and maintains calcium balance, while repair after fracture proceeds through hematoma formation, fibrocartilaginous callus formation, bony callus development, and remodeling to restore original structure."

However,\nthe material in this section is important to understanding how joints provide stability to the skeletal system. Furthermore,\nunderstanding the different types of joints will help one understand how the muscles are able to move bones in specific\nways.\nThe point at which two or more bones meet is called a joint, or articulation. Joints are responsible for movement, such as\nthe movement of limbs, and stability, such as the stability found in the bones of the skull.\nClassification of Joints on the Basis of Structure\nThere are two ways to classify joints: on the basis of their structure or on the basis of their function. The structural\nclassification divides joints into bony, fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints depending on the material composing the\njoint and the presence or absence of a cavity in the joint.\nFibrous Joints\nThe bones of fibrous joints are held together by fibrous connective tissue. There is no cavity, or space, present between\nthe bones and so most fibrous joints do not move at all, or are only capable of minor movements. There are three types\nof fibrous joints: sutures, syndesmoses, and gomphoses. Sutures are found only in the skull and possess short fibers of\nconnective tissue that hold the skull bones tightly in place (Figure 29.23).\n1278\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 29.23 Sutures are fibrous joints found only in the skull.\nSyndesmoses are joints in which the bones are connected by a band of connective tissue, allowing for more movement\nthan in a suture. An example of a syndesmosis is the joint of the tibia and fibula in the ankle. The amount of movement in\nthese types of joints is determined by the length of the connective tissue fibers. Gomphoses occur between teeth and their\nsockets; the term refers to the way the tooth fits into the socket like a peg (Figure 29.24). The tooth is connected to the\nsocket by a connective tissue referred to as the periodontal ligament.\nFigure 29.24 Gomphoses are fibrous joints between the teeth and their sockets. (credit: modification of work by Gray's\nAnatomy)\nCartilaginous Joints\nCartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage. There are two types of cartilaginous joints:\nsynchondroses and symphyses. In a synchondrosis, the bones are joined by hyaline cartilage. Synchondroses are found\nin the epiphyseal plates of growing bones in children. In symphyses, hyaline cartilage covers the end of the bone but the\nconnection between bones occurs through fibrocartilage. Symphyses are found at the joints between vertebrae. Either type\nof cartilaginous joint allows for very little movement.\nSynovial Joints\nSynovial joints are the only joints that have a space between the adjoining bones (Figure 29.25). This space is referred to as\nthe synovial (or joint) cavity and is filled with synovial fluid. Synovial fluid lubricates the joint, reducing friction between\nthe bones and allowing for greater movement. The ends of the bones are covered with articular cartilage, a hyaline cartilage,\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\n1279\nand the entire joint is surrounded by an articular capsule composed of connective tissue that allows movement of the joint\nwhile resisting dislocation. Articular capsules may also possess ligaments that hold the bones together. Synovial joints are\ncapable of the greatest movement of the three structural joint types; however, the more mobile a joint, the weaker the joint.\nKnees, elbows, and shoulders are examples of synovial joints.\nFigure 29.25 Synovial joints are the only joints that have a space or \u201csynovial cavity\u201d in the joint.\nClassification of Joints on the Basis of Function\nThe functional classification divides joints into three categories: synarthroses, amphiarthroses, and diarthroses. A\nsynarthrosis is a joint that is immovable. This includes sutures, gomphoses, and synchondroses. Amphiarthroses are joints\nthat allow slight movement, including syndesmoses and symphyses. Diarthroses are joints that allow for free movement of\nthe joint, as in synovial joints.\nMovement at Synovial Joints\nThe wide range of movement allowed by synovial joints produces different types of movements. The movement of synovial\njoints can be classified as one of four different types: gliding, angular, rotational, or special movement.\nGliding Movement\nGliding movements occur as relatively flat bone surfaces move past each other. Gliding movements produce very little\nrotation or angular movement of the bones. The joints of the carpal and tarsal bones are examples of joints that produce\ngliding movements.\nAngular Movement\nAngular movements are produced when the angle between the bones of a joint changes. There are several different types\nof angular movements, including flexion, extension, hyperextension, abduction, adduction, and circumduction. Flexion, or\nbending, occurs when the angle between the bones decreases. Moving the forearm upward at the elbow or moving the wrist\nto move the hand toward the forearm are examples of flexion. Extension is the opposite of flexion in that the angle between\nthe bones of a joint increases. Straightening a limb after flexion is an example of extension. Extension past the regular\nanatomical position is referred to as hyperextension. This includes moving the neck back to look upward, or bending the\nwrist so that the hand moves away from the forearm.\nAbduction occurs when a bone moves away from the midline of the body. Examples of abduction are moving the arms or\nlegs laterally to lift them straight out to the side. Adduction is the movement of a bone toward the midline of the body.\nMovement of the limbs inward after abduction is an example of adduction. Circumduction is the movement of a limb in a\ncircular motion, as in moving the arm in a circular motion.\n1280\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nRotational Movement\nRotational movement is the movement of a bone as it rotates around its longitudinal axis. Rotation can be toward the\nmidline of the body, which is referred to as medial rotation, or away from the midline of the body, which is referred to as\nlateral rotation. Movement of the head from side to side is an example of rotation.\nSpecial Movements\nSome movements that cannot be classified as gliding, angular, or rotational are called special movements. Inversion\ninvolves the soles of the feet moving inward, toward the midline of the body. Eversion is the opposite of inversion,\nmovement of the sole of the foot outward, away from the midline of the body. Protraction is the anterior movement of\na bone in the horizontal plane. Retraction occurs as a joint moves back into position after protraction. Protraction and\nretraction can be seen in the movement of the mandible as the jaw is thrust outwards and then back inwards. Elevation is\nthe movement of a bone upward, such as when the shoulders are shrugged, lifting the scapulae. Depression is the opposite\nof elevation\u2014movement downward of a bone, such as after the shoulders are shrugged and the scapulae return to their\nnormal position from an elevated position. Dorsiflexion is a bending at the ankle such that the toes are lifted toward the\nknee. Plantar flexion is a bending at the ankle when the heel is lifted, such as when standing on the toes. Supination is the\nmovement of the radius and ulna bones of the forearm so that the palm faces forward. Pronation is the opposite movement,\nin which the palm faces backward. Opposition is the movement of the thumb toward the fingers of the same hand, making\nit possible to grasp and hold objects.\nTypes of Synovial Joints\nSynovial joints are further classified into six different categories on the basis of the shape and structure of the joint. The\nshape of the joint affects the type of movement permitted by the joint (Figure 29.26). These joints can be described as\nplanar, hinge, pivot, condyloid, saddle, or ball-and-socket joints.\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\n1281\nFigure 29.26 Different types of joints allow different types of movement. Planar, hinge, pivot, condyloid, saddle, and\nball-and-socket are all types of synovial joints.\nPlanar Joints\nPlanar joints have bones with articulating surfaces that are flat or slightly curved faces. These joints allow for gliding\nmovements, and so the joints are sometimes referred to as gliding joints. The range of motion is limited in these joints and\ndoes not involve rotation. Planar joints are found in the carpal bones in the hand and the tarsal bones of the foot, as well as\nbetween vertebrae (Figure 29.27).\n1282\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 29.27 The joints of the carpal bones in the wrist are examples of planar joints. (credit: modification of work by\nBrian C. Goss)\nHinge Joints\nIn hinge joints, the slightly rounded end of one bone fits into the slightly hollow end of the other bone. In this way, one\nbone moves while the other remains stationary, like the hinge of a door. The elbow is an example of a hinge joint. The knee\nis sometimes classified as a modified hinge joint (Figure 29.28).\nFigure 29.28 The elbow joint, where the radius articulates with the humerus, is an example of a hinge joint. (credit:\nmodification of work by Brian C. Goss)\nPivot Joints\nPivot joints consist of the rounded end of one bone fitting into a ring formed by the other bone. This structure allows\nrotational movement, as the rounded bone moves around its own axis. An example of a pivot joint is the joint of the first\nand second vertebrae of the neck that allows the head to move back and forth (Figure 29.29). The joint of the wrist that\nallows the palm of the hand to be turned up and down is also a pivot joint.\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\n1283\nFigure 29.29 The joint in the neck that allows the head to move back and forth is an example of a pivot joint.\nCondyloid Joints\nCondyloid joints consist of an oval-shaped end of one bone fitting into a similarly oval-shaped hollow of another bone\n(Figure 29.30). This is also sometimes called an ellipsoidal joint. This type of joint allows angular movement along two\naxes, as seen in the joints of the wrist and fingers, which can move both side to side and up and down.\nFigure 29.30 The metacarpophalangeal joints in the finger are examples of condyloid joints. (credit: modification of\nwork by Gray's Anatomy)\nSaddle Joints\nSaddle joints are so named because the ends of each bone resemble a saddle, with concave and convex portions that fit\ntogether. Saddle joints allow angular movements similar to condyloid joints but with a greater range of motion. An example\nof a saddle joint is the thumb joint, which can move back and forth and up and down, but more freely than the wrist or\n1284\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nfingers (Figure 29.31).\nFigure 29.31 The carpometacarpal joints in the thumb are examples of saddle joints. (credit: modification of work by\nBrian C. Goss)\nBall-and-Socket Joints\nBall-and-socket joints possess a rounded, ball-like end of one bone fitting into a cuplike socket of another bone. This\norganization allows the greatest range of motion, as all movement types are possible in all directions. Examples of ball-and-\nsocket joints are the shoulder and hip joints (Figure 29.32).\nFigure 29.32 The shoulder joint is an example of a ball-and-socket joint.\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\n1285\nWatch this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/synovial_joints) showing the six types of synovial joints.\nThe shoulder and hip joints are an example of a ball-and-socket joint which _____.\na.\npermits extension\nb.\nallows only gliding movement\nc.\nallows abduction or adduction\nd.\nallows rotation\nRheumatologist\nRheumatologists are medical doctors who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the\njoints, muscles, and bones. They diagnose and treat diseases such as arthritis, musculoskeletal disorders,\nosteoporosis, and autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis.\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints of the hands,\nfeet, and cervical spine. Affected joints become swollen, stiff, and painful. Although it is known that RA is an\nautoimmune disease in which the body\u2019s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, the cause of RA\nremains unknown. Immune cells from the blood enter joints and the synovium causing cartilage breakdown,\nswelling, and inflammation of the joint lining. Breakdown of cartilage causes bones to rub against each other\ncausing pain. RA is more common in women than men and the age of onset is usually 40\u201350 years of age.\nRheumatologists can diagnose RA on the basis of symptoms such as joint inflammation and pain, X-ray and\nMRI imaging, and blood tests. Arthrography is a type of medical imaging of joints that uses a contrast agent,\nsuch as a dye, that is opaque to X-rays. This allows the soft tissue structures of joints\u2014such as cartilage,\ntendons, and ligaments\u2014to be visualized. An arthrogram differs from a regular X-ray by showing the surface\nof soft tissues lining the joint in addition to joint bones. An arthrogram allows early degenerative changes in\njoint cartilage to be detected before bones become affected.\nThere is currently no cure for RA; however, rheumatologists have a number of treatment options available.\nEarly stages can be treated with rest of the affected joints by using a cane or by using joint splints that\nminimize inflammation. When inflammation has decreased, exercise can be used to strengthen the muscles\nthat surround the joint and to maintain joint flexibility. If joint damage is more extensive, medications can\nbe used to relieve pain and decrease inflammation. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, topical pain\nrelievers, and corticosteroid injections may be used. Surgery may be required in cases in which joint\ndamage is severe.\n1286\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\n29.4 | Muscle Contraction and Locomotion\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the different types of muscle tissue?\n\u2022\nWhat is the role of muscle contraction in locomotion?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nMuscles move bones, and, in turn, muscle contraction is dependent upon input from the nervous systems. The activities at\nthe neuromuscular junction are similar to the activities occurring at the synapses between neurons.\nThere are approximately 650 skeletal muscles in the human body, each of which is composed of muscle fibers. (The body\nalso contains specialized smooth and cardiac muscle tissue.) In addition to the collection of organelles typical of eukaryotic\ncells, each muscle fiber contains myofibrils, which, in turn, consist of arrangements of protein filaments called actin and\nmyosin. In the sliding filament model of muscle contraction, the thicker myosin filaments have cross-bridges that attach and\ndetach to thinner actin filaments. The binding of myosin to actin causes the actin filaments to slide, shortening the muscle\nfiber. ATP produced in cellular respiration provides the energy needed for contraction. However, contraction requires a\nsignal from the nervous system (excitation-contraction coupling).\nNerve impulses traveling down motor neurons cause the release of the acetylcholine from vesicles in the axon terminus\ninto the synapse between the neuron and the muscle fiber. Acetylcholine binds to receptors on the plasma membrane\n(sarcolemma) of the muscle fiber, allowing an action potential to move to the endoplasmic reticulum where calcium ions\nare stored. When Ca2+ is released in response to the change in voltage, it binds to actin, causing actin filaments to shift\nposition and revealing myosin binding sites for the cross-bridges. The muscle contracts until the nerve impulse stops and\nCa2+ returns to its storage sites.

        "summary": "Joints, or articulations, are points where two or more bones meet, providing both movement and stability to the skeleton. Structurally, they are classified as bony, fibrous, cartilaginous, or synovial, with fibrous and cartilaginous joints allowing little to no movement, and synovial joints permitting the greatest mobility due to a fluid-filled cavity, articular cartilage, and a surrounding capsule. Functionally, joints are categorized as synarthroses (immovable), amphiarthroses (slightly movable), or diarthroses (freely movable). Synovial joints enable various movements: gliding, angular (flexion, extension, hyperextension, abduction, adduction, circumduction), rotational (medial and lateral), and special movements (such as inversion, eversion, protraction, retraction, elevation, depression, dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, supination, pronation, and opposition). They are further divided into six types\u2014planar, hinge, pivot, condyloid, saddle, and ball-and-socket\u2014based on shape and motion range. Joint health is crucial, as seen in disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease primarily affecting synovial joints, leading to inflammation, cartilage breakdown, pain, and loss of mobility; while incurable, RA can be managed through rest, exercise, medication, and sometimes surgery."

Muscles allow for motions such as walking, and they also facilitate bodily\nprocesses such as respiration and digestion. The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle,\nand smooth muscle (Figure 29.33).\nFigure 29.33 The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle,\nvisualized here using light microscopy. Smooth muscle cells are short, tapered at each end, and have only one plump\nnucleus in each. Cardiac muscle cells are branched and striated, but short. The cytoplasm may branch, and they have\none nucleus in the center of the cell. (credit: modification of work by NCI, NIH; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nSkeletal muscle tissue forms skeletal muscles, which attach to bones or skin and control locomotion and any movement\nthat can be consciously controlled. Because it can be controlled by thought, skeletal muscle is also called voluntary muscle.\nSkeletal muscles are long and cylindrical in appearance; when viewed under a microscope, skeletal muscle tissue has\na striped or striated appearance. The striations are caused by the regular arrangement of contractile proteins (actin and\nmyosin). Actin is a globular contractile protein that interacts with myosin for muscle contraction. Skeletal muscle also has\nmultiple nuclei present in a single cell.\nSmooth muscle tissue occurs in the walls of hollow organs such as the intestines, stomach, and urinary bladder, and around\npassages such as the respiratory tract and blood vessels. Smooth muscle has no striations, is not under voluntary control,\nhas only one nucleus per cell, is tapered at both ends, and is called involuntary muscle.\nCardiac muscle tissue is only found in the heart, and cardiac contractions pump blood throughout the body and maintain\nblood pressure. Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated, but unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cannot be\nconsciously controlled and is called involuntary muscle. It has one nucleus per cell, is branched, and is distinguished by the\npresence of intercalated disks.\nSkeletal Muscle Fiber Structure\nEach skeletal muscle fiber is a skeletal muscle cell. These cells are incredibly large, with diameters of up to 100 \u00b5m and\nlengths of up to 30 cm. The plasma membrane of a skeletal muscle fiber is called the sarcolemma. The sarcolemma is\nthe site of action potential conduction, which triggers muscle contraction. Within each muscle fiber are myofibrils\u2014long\ncylindrical structures that lie parallel to the muscle fiber. Myofibrils run the entire length of the muscle fiber, and because\nthey are only approximately 1.2 \u00b5m in diameter, hundreds to thousands can be found inside one muscle fiber. They attach\nto the sarcolemma at their ends, so that as myofibrils shorten, the entire muscle cell contracts (Figure 29.34).\n1288\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 29.34 A skeletal muscle cell is surrounded by a plasma membrane called the sarcolemma with a cytoplasm\ncalled the sarcoplasm. A muscle fiber is composed of many fibrils, packaged into orderly units.\nThe striated appearance of skeletal muscle tissue is a result of repeating bands of the proteins actin and myosin that are\npresent along the length of myofibrils. Dark A bands and light I bands repeat along myofibrils, and the alignment of\nmyofibrils in the cell causes the entire cell to appear striated or banded.\nEach I band has a dense line running vertically through the middle called a Z disc or Z line. The Z discs mark the border\nof units called sarcomeres, which are the functional units of skeletal muscle. One sarcomere is the space between two\nconsecutive Z discs and contains one entire A band and two halves of an I band, one on either side of the A band. A\nmyofibril is composed of many sarcomeres running along its length, and as the sarcomeres individually contract, the\nmyofibrils and muscle cells shorten (Figure 29.35).\nFigure 29.35 A sarcomere is the region from one Z line to the next Z line. Many sarcomeres are present in a myofibril,\nresulting in the striation pattern characteristic of skeletal muscle.\nMyofibrils are composed of smaller structures called myofilaments. There are two main types of filaments: thick filaments\nand thin filaments; each has different compositions and locations. Thick filaments occur only in the A band of a myofibril.\nThin filaments attach to a protein in the Z disc called alpha-actinin and occur across the entire length of the I band and\npartway into the A band. The region at which thick and thin filaments overlap has a dense appearance, as there is little\nspace between the filaments. Thin filaments do not extend all the way into the A bands, leaving a central region of the A\nband that only contains thick filaments. This central region of the A band looks slightly lighter than the rest of the A band\nand is called the H zone. The middle of the H zone has a vertical line called the M line, at which accessory proteins hold\ntogether thick filaments. Both the Z disc and the M line hold myofilaments in place to maintain the structural arrangement\nand layering of the myofibril. Myofibrils are connected to each other by intermediate, or desmin, filaments that attach to the\nZ disc.\nThick and thin filaments are themselves composed of proteins. Thick filaments are composed of the protein myosin. The\ntail of a myosin molecule connects with other myosin molecules to form the central region of a thick filament near the M\nline, whereas the heads align on either side of the thick filament where the thin filaments overlap. The primary component\nof thin filaments is the actin protein. Two other components of the thin filament are tropomyosin and troponin. Actin has\nbinding sites for myosin attachment. Strands of tropomyosin block the binding sites and prevent actin\u2013myosin interactions\nwhen the muscles are at rest. Troponin consists of three globular subunits. One subunit binds to tropomyosin, one subunit\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\n1289\nbinds to actin, and one subunit binds Ca2+ ions.\nView this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/skeletal_muscle) showing the organization of muscle fibers.\n____ are among the largest cells in the human body.\na.\nmyofibrils\nb.\nT-Tubules\nc.\nmuscle fibers\nd.\nsarcomeres\nSliding Filament Model of Contraction\nFor a muscle cell to contract, the sarcomere must shorten. However, thick and thin filaments\u2014the components of\nsarcomeres\u2014do not shorten. Instead, they slide by one another, causing the sarcomere to shorten while the filaments remain\nthe same length. The sliding filament theory of muscle contraction was developed to fit the differences observed in the\nnamed bands on the sarcomere at different degrees of muscle contraction and relaxation. The mechanism of contraction is\nthe binding of myosin to actin, forming cross-bridges that generate filament movement (Figure 29.36).\n1290\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 29.36 When (a) a sarcomere (b) contracts, the Z lines move closer together and the I band gets smaller. The A\nband stays the same width and, at full contraction, the thin filaments overlap.\nWhen a sarcomere shortens, some regions shorten whereas others stay the same length. A sarcomere is defined as the\ndistance between two consecutive Z discs or Z lines; when a muscle contracts, the distance between the Z discs is reduced.\nThe H zone\u2014the central region of the A zone\u2014contains only thick filaments and is shortened during contraction. The I\nband contains only thin filaments and also shortens. The A band does not shorten\u2014it remains the same length\u2014but A bands\nof different sarcomeres move closer together during contraction, eventually disappearing. Thin filaments are pulled by the\nthick filaments toward the center of the sarcomere until the Z discs approach the thick filaments. The zone of overlap, in\nwhich thin filaments and thick filaments occupy the same area, increases as the thin filaments move inward.\nATP and Muscle Contraction\nThe motion of muscle shortening occurs as myosin heads bind to actin and pull the actin inwards. This action requires\nenergy, which is provided by ATP. Myosin binds to actin at a binding site on the globular actin protein. Myosin has another\nbinding site for ATP at which enzymatic activity hydrolyzes ATP to ADP, releasing an inorganic phosphate molecule and\nenergy.\nATP binding causes myosin to release actin, allowing actin and myosin to detach from each other. After this happens, the\nnewly bound ATP is converted to ADP and inorganic phosphate, Pi. The enzyme at the binding site on myosin is called\nATPase. The energy released during ATP hydrolysis changes the angle of the myosin head into a \u201ccocked\u201d position. The\nmyosin head is then in a position for further movement, possessing potential energy, but ADP and Pi are still attached.\nIf actin binding sites are covered and unavailable, the myosin will remain in the high energy configuration with ATP\nhydrolyzed, but still attached.\nIf the actin binding sites are uncovered, a cross-bridge will form; that is, the myosin head spans the distance between the\nactin and myosin molecules. Pi is then released, allowing myosin to expend the stored energy as a conformational change.\nThe myosin head moves toward the M line, pulling the actin along with it. As the actin is pulled, the filaments move\napproximately 10 nm toward the M line. This movement is called the power stroke, as it is the step at which force is\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\n1291\nproduced. As the actin is pulled toward the M line, the sarcomere shortens and the muscle contracts.\nWhen the myosin head is \u201ccocked,\u201d it contains energy and is in a high-energy configuration. This energy is expended as the\nmyosin head moves through the power stroke; at the end of the power stroke, the myosin head is in a low-energy position.\nAfter the power stroke, ADP is released; however, the cross-bridge formed is still in place, and actin and myosin are bound\ntogether. ATP can then attach to myosin, which allows the cross-bridge cycle to start again and further muscle contraction\ncan occur (Figure 29.37).\nWatch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/contract_muscle) explaining how a muscle contraction is signaled.\nWhy can\u2019t actin and myosin interact in the absence of calcium?\na.\nActin binding sites are covered by acetylcholine to which the troponin complex is attached.

Another ATP binds to the actin head,\ncausing the cross-bridge to detach and returning actin to the cocked configuration.\nRegulatory Proteins\nWhen a muscle is in a resting state, actin and myosin are separated. To keep actin from binding to the active site\non myosin, regulatory proteins block the molecular binding sites. Tropomyosin blocks myosin binding sites on actin\nmolecules, preventing cross-bridge formation and preventing contraction in a muscle without nervous input. Troponin\nbinds to tropomyosin and helps to position it on the actin molecule; it also binds calcium ions.\nTo enable a muscle contraction, tropomyosin must change conformation, uncovering the myosin-binding site on an actin\nmolecule and allowing cross-bridge formation. This can only happen in the presence of calcium, which is kept at extremely\nlow concentrations in the sarcoplasm. If present, calcium ions bind to troponin, causing conformational changes in troponin\nthat allow tropomyosin to move away from the myosin binding sites on actin. Once the tropomyosin is removed, a cross-\nbridge can form between actin and myosin, triggering contraction. Cross-bridge cycling continues until Ca2+ ions and ATP\nare no longer available and tropomyosin again covers the binding sites on actin.\nExcitation\u2013Contraction Coupling\nExcitation\u2013contraction coupling is the link (transduction) between the action potential generated in the sarcolemma and the\nstart of a muscle contraction. The trigger for calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcoplasm is a neural\nsignal. Each skeletal muscle fiber is controlled by a motor neuron, which conducts signals from the brain or spinal cord to\nthe muscle. The area of the sarcolemma on the muscle fiber that interacts with the neuron is called the motor end plate.\nThe end of the neuron\u2019s axon is called the synaptic terminal, and it does not actually contact the motor end plate. A small\nspace called the synaptic cleft separates the synaptic terminal from the motor end plate. Electrical signals travel along the\nneuron\u2019s axon, which branches through the muscle and connects to individual muscle fibers at a neuromuscular junction.\nThe ability of cells to communicate electrically requires that the cells expend energy to create an electrical gradient across\ntheir cell membranes. This charge gradient is carried by ions, which are differentially distributed across the membrane. Each\nion exerts an electrical influence and a concentration influence. Just as milk will eventually mix with coffee without the\nneed to stir, ions also distribute themselves evenly, if they are permitted to do so. In this case, they are not permitted to\nreturn to an evenly mixed state.\nThe sodium\u2013potassium ATPase uses cellular energy to move K+ ions inside the cell and Na+ ions outside. This alone\naccumulates a small electrical charge, but a big concentration gradient. There is lots of K+ in the cell and lots of Na+ outside\nthe cell. Potassium is able to leave the cell through K+ channels that are open 90% of the time, and it does. However, Na+\n1294\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nchannels are rarely open, so Na+ remains outside the cell. When K+ leaves the cell, obeying its concentration gradient, that\neffectively leaves a negative charge behind. So at rest, there is a large concentration gradient for Na+ to enter the cell, and\nthere is an accumulation of negative charges left behind in the cell. This is the resting membrane potential. Potential in this\ncontext means a separation of electrical charge that is capable of doing work. It is measured in volts, just like a battery.\nHowever, the transmembrane potential is considerably smaller (0.07 V); therefore, the small value is expressed as millivolts\n(mV) or 70 mV. Because the inside of a cell is negative compared with the outside, a minus sign signifies the excess of\nnegative charges inside the cell, \u221270 mV.\nIf an event changes the permeability of the membrane to Na+ ions, they will enter the cell. That will change the voltage. This\nis an electrical event, called an action potential, that can be used as a cellular signal. Communication occurs between nerves\nand muscles through neurotransmitters. Neuron action potentials cause the release of neurotransmitters from the synaptic\nterminal into the synaptic cleft, where they can then diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to a receptor molecule on the\nmotor end plate. The motor end plate possesses junctional folds\u2014folds in the sarcolemma that create a large surface area\nfor the neurotransmitter to bind to receptors. The receptors are actually sodium channels that open to allow the passage of\nNa+ into the cell when they receive neurotransmitter signal.\nAcetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter released by motor neurons that binds to receptors in the motor end plate.\nNeurotransmitter release occurs when an action potential travels down the motor neuron\u2019s axon, resulting in altered\npermeability of the synaptic terminal membrane and an influx of calcium. The Ca2+ ions allow synaptic vesicles to move to\nand bind with the presynaptic membrane (on the neuron), and release neurotransmitter from the vesicles into the synaptic\ncleft. Once released by the synaptic terminal, ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft to the motor end plate, where it binds\nwith ACh receptors. As a neurotransmitter binds, these ion channels open, and Na+ ions cross the membrane into the muscle\ncell. This reduces the voltage difference between the inside and outside of the cell, which is called depolarization. As ACh\nbinds at the motor end plate, this depolarization is called an end-plate potential. The depolarization then spreads along the\nsarcolemma, creating an action potential as sodium channels adjacent to the initial depolarization site sense the change in\nvoltage and open. The action potential moves across the entire cell, creating a wave of depolarization.\nACh is broken down by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) into acetyl and choline. AChE resides in the synaptic\ncleft, breaking down ACh so that it does not remain bound to ACh receptors, which would cause unwanted extended muscle\ncontraction (Figure 29.38).\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\n1295\nFigure 29.38 This diagram shows excitation-contraction coupling in a skeletal muscle contraction. The\nsarcoplasmic reticulum is a specialized endoplasmic reticulum found in muscle cells.\nWhere are the Ca2+ ions stored?\na.\nSarcomere\nb.\nsarcoplasm\nc.\nsarcolemma\nd.\nsarcoplasmic reticulum\nAfter depolarization, the membrane returns to its resting state. This is called repolarization, during which voltage-\ngated sodium channels close. Potassium channels continue at 90% conductance. Because the plasma membrane\nsodium\u2013potassium ATPase always transports ions, the resting state (negatively charged inside relative to the outside) is\nrestored. The period immediately following the transmission of an impulse in a nerve or muscle, in which a neuron or\nmuscle cell regains its ability to transmit another impulse, is called the refractory period. During the refractory period, the\nmembrane cannot generate another action potential. . The refractory period allows the voltage-sensitive ion channels to\nreturn to their resting configurations. The sodium potassium ATPase continually moves Na+ back out of the cell and K+\nback into the cell, and the K+ leaks out leaving negative charge behind. Very quickly, the membrane repolarizes, so that it\ncan again be depolarized.\n1296\nChapter 29 | The Musculoskeletal System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nControl of Muscle Tension\nNeural control initiates the formation of actin\u2013myosin cross-bridges, leading to the sarcomere shortening involved in muscle\ncontraction. These contractions extend from the muscle fiber through connective tissue to pull on bones, causing skeletal\nmovement. The pull exerted by a muscle is called tension, and the amount of force created by this tension can vary. This\nenables the same muscles to move very light objects and very heavy objects. In individual muscle fibers, the amount of\ntension produced depends on the cross-sectional area of the muscle fiber and the frequency of neural stimulation.\nThe number of cross-bridges formed between actin and myosin determine the amount of tension that a muscle fiber can\nproduce. Cross-bridges can only form where thick and thin filaments overlap, allowing myosin to bind to actin. If more\ncross-bridges are formed, more myosin will pull on actin, and more tension will be produced.\nThe ideal length of a sarcomere during production of maximal tension occurs when thick and thin filaments overlap to\nthe greatest degree. If a sarcomere at rest is stretched past an ideal resting length, thick and thin filaments do not overlap\nto the greatest degree, and fewer cross-bridges can form. This results in fewer myosin heads pulling on actin, and less\ntension is produced. As a sarcomere is shortened, the zone of overlap is reduced as the thin filaments reach the H zone,\nwhich is composed of myosin tails. Because it is myosin heads that form cross-bridges, actin will not bind to myosin in\nthis zone, reducing the tension produced by this myofiber. If the sarcomere is shortened even more, thin filaments begin\nto overlap with each other\u2014reducing cross-bridge formation even further, and producing even less tension. Conversely, if\nthe sarcomere is stretched to the point at which thick and thin filaments do not overlap at all, no cross-bridges are formed\nand no tension is produced. This amount of stretching does not usually occur because accessory proteins, internal sensory\nnerves, and connective tissue oppose extreme stretching.\nThe primary variable determining force production is the number of myofibers within the muscle that receive an action\npotential from the neuron that controls that fiber. When using the biceps to pick up a pencil, the motor cortex of the brain\nonly signals a few neurons of the biceps, and only a few myofibers respond. In vertebrates, each myofiber responds fully\nif stimulated. When picking up a piano, the motor cortex signals all of the neurons in the biceps and every myofiber\nparticipates. This is close to the maximum force the muscle can produce. As mentioned above, increasing the frequency of\naction potentials (the number of signals per second) can increase the force a bit more, because the tropomyosin is flooded\nwith calcium.\nThink About It\n\u2022\nThe deadly nerve gas Sarin irreversibly inhibits the enzyme, acetylcholinesterase.

Skeletal muscle fibers contain myofibrils made of repeating sarcomeres composed of thick (myosin) and thin (actin, tropomyosin, troponin) filaments, whose interactions produce contraction via the sliding filament model. Contraction is initiated by excitation\u2013contraction coupling, where nerve impulses at the neuromuscular junction trigger acetylcholine release, depolarizing the muscle fiber membrane and causing calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum; calcium binding to troponin shifts tropomyosin, exposing myosin-binding sites on actin. The cross-bridge cycle, powered by ATP, repeatedly forms and releases links between actin and myosin, producing the power strokes that shorten sarcomeres. Muscle tension depends on factors such as sarcomere length, the number of fibers activated, and frequency of neural stimulation, enabling the same muscles to handle tasks ranging from delicate to heavy movements."

How often a breath is taken and how much air is inhaled or exhaled are tightly regulated\nby the respiratory center in the brain. Humans, when they aren\u2019t exerting themselves, breathe approximately 15 times per\nminute on average. Canines, like the dog in Figure 30.1, have a respiratory rate of about 15\u201330 breaths per minute. In\naddition to exhaling carbon dioxide when we breathe, scientists believe people with cancerous lung cells also exhale tiny\namounts of volatile organic compounds. Researchers used specially trained dogs to see if they could tell the difference\nbetween people with and without lung cancer. The dogs correctly identified 71 out of 100 lung cancer patients and 372 out\nof 400 who did not. You can read more about this exciting research here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32lungcancer) .\n30.1 | Systems of Gas Exchange\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow does air pass from the outside environment to the lungs?\n\u2022\nHow are lungs protected from particulate matter?\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\n1309\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nMuch of the information in this chapter is not within the scope for AP\u00ae. However, studying the respiratory system provides\nan opportunity to apply concepts we have previously explored, including chemistry and pH, cell membrane structure, and\ndiffusion of molecules across membranes. The respiratory systems of both invertebrate and vertebrate animals\u2014from the\ntracheal system of insects and gills of fish to lungs in reptiles, birds, and mammals\u2014reflect a distinct pattern of evolution\nas animals transitioned from aquatic to terrestrial environments. The function of all respiratory systems is to facilitate the\nexchange of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) with the environment. Energy production in cellular respiration requires\nO2, and CO2 is produced as a toxic by-product. Some animals, such as worms and amphibians, use their entire body surface\nfor respiration. Terrestrial animals, including humans, needed a more efficient system for gas exchange. So, take a deep\nbreath (pun intended!) as we take a dive into the activities and functions of the respiratory system.\nDo not confuse the respiratory system with cellular respiration although both involve the movement of O2 and CO2 (gas\nexchange) between organism and environment.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 and Big Idea 4\nof the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP\u00ae Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide\na transparent foundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and\nAP\u00ae exam questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.\nBig Idea 2\nBiological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to reproduce,\nand to maintain dynamic homeostasis.\nEnduring\nUnderstanding\n2.A\nGrowth, reproduction and maintenance of living systems require free energy and matter.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n2.A.3 Organisms must exchange matter with the environment to grow, reproduce and\nmaintain organization.\nScience\nPractice\n6.2 The student can construct explanations of phenomena based on evidence produced\nthrough scientific practices.\nLearning\nObjective\n2.7 The student is able to explain how cell size and shape effect the overall rate of nutrient\nintake and the rate of waste elimination.\nBig Idea 4\nBiological systems interact, and these systems and their interactions possess complex\nproperties.\nEnduring\nUnderstanding\n4.A\nInteractions within biological systems lead to complex properties.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n4.A.6 Interactions among living systems and with their environment result in the movement\nof matter and energy.\nScience\nPractice\n1.3 The student can refine representations and models of natural or man-made phenomena\nand systems in the domain.\nLearning\nObjective\n4.15 The student is able to use visual representations to analyze situation or solve problems\nquantitatively to illustrate how interactions among living systems and within their environment\nresult in the movement of matter and energy.\nThe primary function of the respiratory system is to deliver oxygen to the cells of the body\u2019s tissues and remove carbon\ndioxide, a cell waste product. The main structures of the human respiratory system are the nasal cavity, the trachea, and\nlungs.\nAll aerobic organisms require oxygen to carry out their metabolic functions. Along the evolutionary tree, different\norganisms have devised different means of obtaining oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere. The environment in which\nthe animal lives greatly determines how an animal respires. The complexity of the respiratory system is correlated with the\nsize of the organism. As animal size increases, diffusion distances increase and the ratio of surface area to volume drops.\nIn unicellular organisms, diffusion across the cell membrane is sufficient for supplying oxygen to the cell (Figure 30.2).\n1310\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nDiffusion is a slow, passive transport process. In order for diffusion to be a feasible means of providing oxygen to the cell,\nthe rate of oxygen uptake must match the rate of diffusion across the membrane. In other words, if the cell were very large\nor thick, diffusion would not be able to provide oxygen quickly enough to the inside of the cell. Therefore, dependence\non diffusion as a means of obtaining oxygen and removing carbon dioxide remains feasible only for small organisms or\nthose with highly-flattened bodies, such as many flatworms (Platyhelminthes). Larger organisms had to evolve specialized\nrespiratory tissues, such as gills, lungs, and respiratory passages accompanied by complex circulatory systems, to transport\noxygen throughout their entire body.\nFigure 30.2 The cell of the unicellular algae Ventricaria ventricosa is one of the largest known, reaching one to five\ncentimeters in diameter. Like all single-celled organisms, V. ventricosa exchanges gases across the cell membrane.\nDirect Diffusion\nFor small multicellular organisms, diffusion across the outer membrane is sufficient to meet their oxygen needs. Gas\nexchange by direct diffusion across surface membranes is efficient for organisms less than 1 mm in diameter. In simple\norganisms, such as cnidarians and flatworms, every cell in the body is close to the external environment. Their cells\nare kept moist and gases diffuse quickly via direct diffusion. Flatworms are small, literally flat worms, which \u2018breathe\u2019\nthrough diffusion across the outer membrane (Figure 30.3). The flat shape of these organisms increases the surface area for\ndiffusion, ensuring that each cell within the body is close to the outer membrane surface and has access to oxygen. If the\nflatworm had a cylindrical body, then the cells in the center would not be able to get oxygen.\nFigure 30.3 This flatworm\u2019s process of respiration works by diffusion across the outer membrane. (credit: Stephen\nChilds)\nSkin and Gills\nEarthworms and amphibians use their skin (integument) as a respiratory organ. A dense network of capillaries lies just\nbelow the skin and facilitates gas exchange between the external environment and the circulatory system. The respiratory\nsurface must be kept moist in order for the gases to dissolve and diffuse across cell membranes.\nOrganisms that live in water need to obtain oxygen from the water. Oxygen dissolves in water but at a lower concentration\nthan in the atmosphere. The atmosphere has roughly 21 percent oxygen. In water, the oxygen concentration is much smaller\nthan that. Fish and many other aquatic organisms have evolved gills to take up the dissolved oxygen from water (Figure\n30.4). Gills are thin tissue filaments that are highly branched and folded. When water passes over the gills, the dissolved\noxygen in water rapidly diffuses across the gills into the bloodstream. The circulatory system can then carry the oxygenated\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\n1311\nblood to the other parts of the body. In animals that contain coelomic fluid instead of blood, oxygen diffuses across the gill\nsurfaces into the coelomic fluid. Gills are found in mollusks, annelids, and crustaceans.\nFigure 30.4 This common carp, like many other aquatic organisms, has gills that allow it to obtain oxygen from water.\n(credit: \"Guitardude012\"/Wikimedia Commons)\nThe folded surfaces of the gills provide a large surface area to ensure that the fish gets sufficient oxygen. Diffusion is a\nprocess in which material travels from regions of high concentration to low concentration until equilibrium is reached. In\nthis case, blood with a low concentration of oxygen molecules circulates through the gills. The concentration of oxygen\nmolecules in water is higher than the concentration of oxygen molecules in gills. As a result, oxygen molecules diffuse from\nwater (high concentration) to blood (low concentration), as shown in Figure 30.5. Similarly, carbon dioxide molecules in\nthe blood diffuse from the blood (high concentration) to water (low concentration).\nThe illustration shows a fish, with a box indicating the location of the gills, behind the head. A close-\nup image shows the gills, each of which resembles a feathery worm. Two stacks of gills attach to a\nstructure called a columnar gill arch, forming a tall V. Water travels in from the outside of the V,\nbetween each gill, then travels out of the top of the V. Veins travel into the gill from the base of the\ngill arch, and arteries travel back out on the opposite side. A close-up image of a single gill shows\nthat water travels over the gill, passing over deoxygenated veins first, then over oxygenated\narteries.\nFigure 30.5 As water flows over the gills, oxygen is transferred to blood via the veins. (credit \"fish\": modification of\nwork by Duane Raver, NOAA)\nTracheal Systems\nInsect respiration is independent of its circulatory system; therefore, the blood does not play a direct role in oxygen\ntransport. Insects have a highly specialized type of respiratory system called the tracheal system, which consists of a\nnetwork of small tubes that carries oxygen to the entire body. The tracheal system is the most direct and efficient respiratory\nsystem in active animals. The tubes in the tracheal system are made of a polymeric material called chitin.\nInsect bodies have openings, called spiracles, along the thorax and abdomen. These openings connect to the tubular network,\nallowing oxygen to pass into the body (Figure 30.6) and regulating the diffusion of CO2 and water vapor. Air enters and\nleaves the tracheal system through the spiracles. Some insects can ventilate the tracheal system with body movements.\n1312\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 30.6 Insects perform respiration via a tracheal system.\nMammalian Systems\nIn mammals, pulmonary ventilation occurs via inhalation (breathing). During inhalation, air enters the body through the\nnasal cavity located just inside the nose (Figure 30.7). As air passes through the nasal cavity, the air is warmed to body\ntemperature and humidified. The respiratory tract is coated with mucus to seal the tissues from direct contact with air. Mucus\nis high in water. As air crosses these surfaces of the mucous membranes, it picks up water. These processes help equilibrate\nthe air to the body conditions, reducing any damage that cold, dry air can cause. Particulate matter that is floating in the air\nis removed in the nasal passages via mucus and cilia. The processes of warming, humidifying, and removing particles are\nimportant protective mechanisms that prevent damage to the trachea and lungs. Thus, inhalation serves several purposes in\naddition to bringing oxygen into the respiratory system.\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\n1313\nFigure 30.7 Air enters the respiratory system through the nasal cavity and pharynx, and then passes through the\ntrachea and into the bronchi, which bring air into the lungs. (credit: modification of work by NCI)\nIn which order does inhaled air travel from the pharynx to the bronchioles?\na.\npharynx \u2192 trachea \u2192 larynx \u2192 bronchi\u2192 bronchioles.\nb.\npharynx \u2192 larynx \u2192 trachea \u2192 bronchi\u2192 bronchioles\nc.\npharynx \u2192 larynx \u2192 trachea \u2192 bronchioles \u2192 bronchi\nd.\npharynx \u2192 trachea \u2192 larynx \u2192 bronchioles \u2192 bronchi\nFrom the nasal cavity, air passes through the pharynx (throat) and the larynx (voice box), as it makes its way to the trachea\n(Figure 30.7). The main function of the trachea is to funnel the inhaled air to the lungs and the exhaled air back out of\nthe body. The human trachea is a cylinder about 10 to 12 cm long and 2 cm in diameter that sits in front of the esophagus\nand extends from the larynx into the chest cavity where it divides into the two primary bronchi at the midthorax. It is\nmade of incomplete rings of hyaline cartilage and smooth muscle (Figure 30.8). The trachea is lined with mucus-producing\ngoblet cells and ciliated epithelia. The cilia propel foreign particles trapped in the mucus toward the pharynx. The cartilage\nprovides strength and support to the trachea to keep the passage open. The smooth muscle can contract, decreasing the\ntrachea\u2019s diameter, which causes expired air to rush upwards from the lungs at a great force. The forced exhalation helps\nexpel mucus when we cough. Smooth muscle can contract or relax, depending on stimuli from the external environment or\nthe body\u2019s nervous system.\n1314\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 30.8 The trachea and bronchi are made of incomplete rings of cartilage. (credit: modification of work by Gray's\nAnatomy)\nLungs: Bronchi and Alveoli\nThe end of the trachea bifurcates (divides) to the right and left lungs. The lungs are not identical. The right lung is larger\nand contains three lobes, whereas the smaller left lung contains two lobes (Figure 30.9). The muscular diaphragm, which\nfacilitates breathing, is inferior to (below) the lungs and marks the end of the thoracic cavity.\nFigure 30.9 The trachea bifurcates into the right and left bronchi in the lungs. The right lung is made of three lobes\nand is larger. To accommodate the heart, the left lung is smaller and has only two lobes.\nIn the lungs, air is diverted into smaller and smaller passages, or bronchi. Air enters the lungs through the two primary\n(main) bronchi (singular: bronchus). Each bronchus divides into secondary bronchi, then into tertiary bronchi, which\nin turn divide, creating smaller and smaller diameter bronchioles as they split and spread through the lung. Like the\ntrachea, the bronchi are made of cartilage and smooth muscle. At the bronchioles, the cartilage is replaced with elastic\nfibers. Bronchi are innervated by nerves of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems that control\nmuscle contraction (parasympathetic) or relaxation (sympathetic) in the bronchi and bronchioles, depending on the nervous\nsystem\u2019s cues. In humans, bronchioles with a diameter smaller than 0.5 mm are the respiratory bronchioles. They lack\ncartilage and therefore rely on inhaled air to support their shape. As the passageways decrease in diameter, the relative\namount of smooth muscle increases.\nThe terminal bronchioles subdivide into microscopic branches called respiratory bronchioles. The respiratory bronchioles\nsubdivide into several alveolar ducts. Numerous alveoli and alveolar sacs surround the alveolar ducts. The alveolar sacs\nresemble bunches of grapes tethered to the end of the bronchioles (Figure 30.10). In the acinar region, the alveolar ducts\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\n1315\nare attached to the end of each bronchiole. At the end of each duct are approximately 100 alveolar sacs, each containing 20\nto 30 alveoli that are 200 to 300 microns in diameter. Gas exchange occurs only in alveoli. Alveoli are made of thin-walled\nparenchymal cells, typically one-cell thick, that look like tiny bubbles within the sacs. Alveoli are in direct contact with\ncapillaries (one-cell thick) of the circulatory system. Such intimate contact ensures that oxygen will diffuse from alveoli\ninto the blood and be distributed to the cells of the body. In addition, the carbon dioxide that was produced by cells as a\nwaste product will diffuse from the blood into alveoli to be exhaled. The anatomical arrangement of capillaries and alveoli\nemphasizes the structural and functional relationship of the respiratory and circulatory systems. Because there are so many\nalveoli (~300 million per lung) within each alveolar sac and so many sacs at the end of each alveolar duct, the lungs have a\nsponge-like consistency. This organization produces a very large surface area that is available for gas exchange. The surface\narea of alveoli in the lungs is approximately 75 m2. This large surface area, combined with the thin-walled nature of the\nalveolar parenchymal cells, allows gases to easily diffuse across the cells.\nFigure 30.10 Terminal bronchioles are connected by respiratory bronchioles to alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs. Each\nalveolar sac contains 20 to 30 spherical alveoli and has the appearance of a bunch of grapes. Air flows into the atrium\nof the alveolar sac, then circulates into alveoli where gas exchange occurs with the capillaries. Mucous glands secrete\nmucous into the airways, keeping them moist and flexible.

The respiratory system contains several protective mechanisms to avoid\nproblems or tissue damage. In the nasal cavity, hairs and mucus trap small particles, viruses, bacteria, dust, and dirt to\nprevent their entry.\nIf particulates do make it beyond the nose, or enter through the mouth, the bronchi and bronchioles of the lungs also contain\nseveral protective devices. The lungs produce mucus\u2014a sticky substance made of mucin, a complex glycoprotein, as well\nas salts and water\u2014that traps particulates. The bronchi and bronchioles contain cilia, small hair-like projections that line\nthe walls of the bronchi and bronchioles (Figure 30.11). These cilia beat in unison and move mucus and particles out of the\nbronchi and bronchioles back up to the throat where it is swallowed and eliminated via the esophagus.\nIn humans, for example, tar and other substances in cigarette smoke destroy or paralyze the cilia, making the removal of\nparticles more difficult. In addition, smoking causes the lungs to produce more mucus, which the damaged cilia are not able\nto move. This causes a persistent cough, as the lungs try to rid themselves of particulate matter, and makes smokers more\nsusceptible to respiratory ailments.\nFigure 30.11 The bronchi and bronchioles contain cilia that help move mucus and other particles out of the lungs.\n(credit: Louisa Howard, modification of work by Dartmouth Electron Microscope Facility)\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\n1317\nThink About It\nHow does the structure of alveoli maximize gas exchange?\n30.2 | Gas Exchange across Respiratory Surfaces\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the names and descriptions of lung volumes and capacities?\n\u2022\nHow does gas pressure influence the movement of gases into and out of the body?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe information in this section about lung volumes and capacities is outside the scope for AP\u00ae.

Because of the enormous number of alveoli\n(approximately 300 million in each human lung), the surface area of the lung is very large (75 m2). Having such a large\nsurface area increases the amount of gas that can diffuse into and out of the lungs.\nBasic Principles of Gas Exchange\nGas exchange during respiration occurs primarily through diffusion. Diffusion is a process in which transport is driven by\na concentration gradient. Gas molecules move from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration. Blood\nthat is low in oxygen concentration and high in carbon dioxide concentration undergoes gas exchange with air in the lungs.\nThe air in the lungs has a higher concentration of oxygen than that of oxygen-depleted blood and a lower concentration of\ncarbon dioxide. This concentration gradient allows for gas exchange during respiration.\nPartial pressure is a measure of the concentration of the individual components in a mixture of gases. The total pressure\nexerted by the mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the components in the mixture. The rate of diffusion of a gas is\nproportional to its partial pressure within the total gas mixture. This concept is discussed further in detail below.\nLung Volumes and Capacities\nDifferent animals have different lung capacities based on their activities. Cheetahs have evolved a much higher lung\ncapacity than humans; it helps provide oxygen to all the muscles in the body and allows them to run very fast. Elephants\nalso have a high lung capacity. In this case, it is not because they run fast but because they have a large body and must be\nable to take up oxygen in accordance with their body size.\nHuman lung size is determined by genetics, sex, and height. At maximal capacity, an average lung can hold almost six liters\nof air, but lungs do not usually operate at maximal capacity. Air in the lungs is measured in terms of lung volumes and\nlung capacities (Figure 30.12 and Table 30.1). Volume measures the amount of air for one function (such as inhalation\nor exhalation). Capacity is any two or more volumes (for example, how much can be inhaled from the end of a maximal\nexhalation).\nFigure 30.12 Human lung volumes and capacities are shown. The total lung capacity of the adult male is six liters.\nTidal volume is the volume of air inhaled in a single, normal breath. Inspiratory capacity is the amount of air taken in\nduring a deep breath, and residual volume is the amount of air left in the lungs after forceful respiration.\nLung Volumes and Capacities (Avg Adult Male)\nVolume/\nCapacity\nDefinition\nVolume\n(liters)\nEquations\nTidal volume (TV)\nAmount of air inhaled during a normal breath\n0.5\n-\nExpiratory reserve\nvolume (ERV)\nAmount of air that can be exhaled after a normal\nexhalation\n1.2\n-\nTable 30.1\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\n1319\nLung Volumes and Capacities (Avg Adult Male)\nVolume/\nCapacity\nDefinition\nVolume\n(liters)\nEquations\nInspiratory reserve\nvolume (IRV)\nAmount of air that can be further inhaled after a normal\ninhalation\n3.1\n-\nResidual volume\n(RV)\nAir left in the lungs after a forced exhalation\n1.2\n-\nVital capacity (VC)\nMaximum amount of air that can be moved in or out of\nthe lungs in a single respiratory cycle\n4.8\nERV+TV+IRV\nInspiratory capacity\n(IC)\nVolume of air that can be inhaled in addition to a\nnormal exhalation\n3.6\nTV+IRV\nFunctional residual\ncapacity (FRC)\nVolume of air remaining after a normal exhalation\n2.4\nERV+RV\nTotal lung capacity\n(TLC)\nTotal volume of air in the lungs after a maximal\ninspiration\n6.0\nRV+ERV+TV+IRV\nForced expiratory\nvolume (FEV1)\nHow much air can be forced out of the lungs over a\nspecific time period, usually one second\n~4.1 to 5.5\n-\nTable 30.1\nThe volume in the lung can be divided into four units: tidal volume, expiratory reserve volume, inspiratory reserve volume,\nand residual volume. Tidal volume (TV) measures the amount of air that is inspired and expired during a normal breath.\nOn average, this volume is around one-half liter, which is a little less than the capacity of a 20-ounce drink bottle. The\nexpiratory reserve volume (ERV) is the additional amount of air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation. It is the\nreserve amount that can be exhaled beyond what is normal. Conversely, the inspiratory reserve volume (IRV) is the\nadditional amount of air that can be inhaled after a normal inhalation. The residual volume (RV) is the amount of air that is\nleft after expiratory reserve volume is exhaled. The lungs are never completely empty: There is always some air left in the\nlungs after a maximal exhalation. If this residual volume did not exist and the lungs emptied completely, the lung tissues\nwould stick together and the energy necessary to re-inflate the lung could be too great to overcome. Therefore, there is\nalways some air remaining in the lungs. Residual volume is also important for preventing large fluctuations in respiratory\ngases (O2 and CO2). The residual volume is the only lung volume that cannot be measured directly because it is impossible\nto completely empty the lung of air. This volume can only be calculated rather than measured.\nCapacities are measurements of two or more volumes. The vital capacity (VC) measures the maximum amount of air that\ncan be inhaled or exhaled during a respiratory cycle. It is the sum of the expiratory reserve volume, tidal volume, and\ninspiratory reserve volume. The inspiratory capacity (IC) is the amount of air that can be inhaled after the end of a normal\nexpiration. It is, therefore, the sum of the tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume. The functional residual capacity\n(FRC) includes the expiratory reserve volume and the residual volume. The FRC measures the amount of additional air that\ncan be exhaled after a normal exhalation. Lastly, the total lung capacity (TLC) is a measurement of the total amount of air\nthat the lung can hold. It is the sum of the residual volume, expiratory reserve volume, tidal volume, and inspiratory reserve\nvolume.\nLung volumes are measured by a technique called spirometry. An important measurement taken during spirometry is the\nforced expiratory volume (FEV), which measures how much air can be forced out of the lung over a specific period,\nusually one second (FEV1). In addition, the forced vital capacity (FVC), which is the total amount of air that can be forcibly\nexhaled, is measured. The ratio of these values (FEV1/FVC ratio) is used to diagnose lung diseases including asthma,\nemphysema, and fibrosis. If the FEV1/FVC ratio is high, the lungs are not compliant (meaning they are stiff and unable\nto bend properly), and the patient most likely has lung fibrosis. Patients exhale most of the lung volume very quickly.\nConversely, when the FEV1/FVC ratio is low, there is resistance in the lung that is characteristic of asthma. In this instance,\nit is hard for the patient to get the air out of his or her lungs, and it takes a long time to reach the maximal exhalation volume.\nIn either case, breathing is difficult and complications arise.\n1320\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nRespiratory Therapist\nRespiratory therapists or respiratory practitioners evaluate and treat patients with lung and cardiovascular\ndiseases. They work as part of a medical team to develop treatment plans for patients. Respiratory\ntherapists may treat premature babies with underdeveloped lungs, patients with chronic conditions such\nas asthma, or older patients suffering from lung disease such as emphysema and chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease (COPD). They may operate advanced equipment such as compressed gas delivery\nsystems, ventilators, blood gas analyzers, and resuscitators. Specialized programs to become a respiratory\ntherapist generally lead to a bachelor\u2019s degree with a respiratory therapist specialty. Because of a growing\naging population, career opportunities as a respiratory therapist are expected to remain strong.\nGas Pressure and Respiration\nThe respiratory process can be better understood by examining the properties of gases. Gases move freely, but gas particles\nare constantly hitting the walls of their vessel, thereby producing gas pressure.\nAir is a mixture of gases, primarily nitrogen (N2; 78.6 percent), oxygen (O2; 20.9 percent), water vapor (H2O; 0.5 percent),\nand carbon dioxide (CO2; 0.04 percent). Each gas component of that mixture exerts a pressure. The pressure for an\nindividual gas in the mixture is the partial pressure of that gas. Approximately 21 percent of atmospheric gas is oxygen.\nCarbon dioxide, however, is found in relatively small amounts, 0.04 percent. The partial pressure for oxygen is much greater\nthan that of carbon dioxide. The partial pressure of any gas can be calculated by:\nP = (Patm)\u00d7(percent content in mixture).\nPatm, the atmospheric pressure, is the sum of all of the partial pressures of the atmospheric gases added together,\nPatm= PN2 + PO2 + PH2 O+ PCO2 = 760 mm Hg\n\u00d7 (percent content in mixture).\nThe pressure of the atmosphere at sea level is 760 mm Hg. Therefore, the partial pressure of oxygen is:\nPO2 = (760 mm Hg) (0.21) = 160 mm Hg\nand for carbon dioxide:\nPCO2 = (760 mm Hg) (0.0004) = 0.3 mm Hg.\nAt high altitudes, Patm decreases but concentration does not change; the partial pressure decrease is due to the reduction in\nPatm.\nWhen the air mixture reaches the lung, it has been humidified. The pressure of the water vapor in the lung does not change\nthe pressure of the air, but it must be included in the partial pressure equation. For this calculation, the water pressure (47\nmm Hg) is subtracted from the atmospheric pressure:\n760 mm Hg \u221247 mm Hg = 713 mm Hg\nand the partial pressure of oxygen is:\n(760 mm Hg \u221247 mm Hg)\u00d70.21 = 150 mm Hg.\nThese pressures determine the gas exchange, or the flow of gas, in the system. Oxygen and carbon dioxide will flow\naccording to their pressure gradient from high to low. Therefore, understanding the partial pressure of each gas will aid in\nunderstanding how gases move in the respiratory system.\nGas Exchange across the Alveoli\nIn the body, oxygen is used by cells of the body\u2019s tissues and carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product. The ratio of\ncarbon dioxide production to oxygen consumption is the respiratory quotient (RQ). RQ varies between 0.7 and 1.0. If just\nglucose were used to fuel the body, the RQ would equal one. One mole of carbon dioxide would be produced for every mole\nof oxygen consumed. Glucose, however, is not the only fuel for the body. Protein and fat are also used as fuels for the body.\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\n1321\nBecause of this, less carbon dioxide is produced than oxygen is consumed and the RQ is, on average, about 0.7 for fat and\nabout 0.8 for protein.\nThe RQ is used to calculate the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveolar spaces within the lung, the alveolar PO2 Above,\nthe partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs was calculated to be 150 mm Hg. However, lungs never fully deflate with an\nexhalation; therefore, the inspired air mixes with this residual air and lowers the partial pressure of oxygen within the\nalveoli. This means that there is a lower concentration of oxygen in the lungs than is found in the air outside the body.\nKnowing the RQ, the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli can be calculated:\nalveolar PO2 = inspired PO2 \u2212 (\nalveolar PO2\nRQ\n)\nWith an RQ of 0.8 and a PCO2 in the alveoli of 40 mm Hg, the alveolar PO2 is equal to:\nalveolar PO2 = 150 mm Hg \u2212 (40 mm Hg\n0.8\n) = mm Hg.\nNotice that this pressure is less than the external air. Therefore, the oxygen will flow from the inspired air in the lung ( PO2\n= 150 mm Hg) into the bloodstream ( PO2 = 100 mm Hg) (Figure 30.13).\nIn the lungs, oxygen diffuses out of the alveoli and into the capillaries surrounding the alveoli. Oxygen (about 98 percent)\nbinds reversibly to the respiratory pigment hemoglobin found in red blood cells (RBCs). RBCs carry oxygen to the tissues\nwhere oxygen dissociates from the hemoglobin and diffuses into the cells of the tissues. More specifically, alveolar PO2\nis higher in the alveoli ( PALVO 2 = 100 mm Hg) than blood PO2 (40 mm Hg) in the capillaries. Because this pressure\ngradient exists, oxygen diffuses down its pressure gradient, moving out of the alveoli and entering the blood of the\ncapillaries where O2 binds to hemoglobin. At the same time, alveolar PCO2 is lower PALVO 2 = 40 mm Hg than blood\nPCO2 = (45 mm Hg). CO2 diffuses down its pressure gradient, moving out of the capillaries and entering the alveoli.\nOxygen and carbon dioxide move independently of each other; they diffuse down their own pressure gradients. As blood\nleaves the lungs through the pulmonary veins, the venous PO2 = 100 mm Hg, whereas the venous PCO2 = 40 mm Hg. As\nblood enters the systemic capillaries, the blood will lose oxygen and gain carbon dioxide because of the pressure difference\nof the tissues and blood. In systemic capillaries, PO2 = 100 mm Hg, but in the tissue cells, PO2 = 40 mm Hg. This pressure\ngradient drives the diffusion of oxygen out of the capillaries and into the tissue cells. At the same time, blood PCO2 = 40\nmm Hg and systemic tissue PCO2 = 45 mm Hg. The pressure gradient drives CO2 out of tissue cells and into the capillaries.\nThe blood returning to the lungs through the pulmonary arteries has a venous PO2 = 40 mm Hg and a PCO2 = 45 mm Hg.\nThe blood enters the lung capillaries where the process of exchanging gases between the capillaries and alveoli begins again\n(Figure 30.13).\n1322\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 30.13 The partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide change as blood moves through the body.\nHow do PO2 and PCO2 change as blood passes from the arteries to the veins within body tissues?\na.\nPO2 drops and PCO2 drops.\nb.\nPO2 increases and PCO2 decreases.\nc.\nPO2 increases and PCO2 increases.\nd.\nPO2 drops and PCO2 increases.\nIn short, the change in partial pressure from the alveoli to the capillaries drives the oxygen into the tissues and the carbon\ndioxide into the blood from the tissues.

        "summary": "Gas exchange across respiratory surfaces occurs primarily by diffusion, with oxygen and carbon dioxide moving down their respective partial pressure gradients. The alveoli, with about 300 million per lung and a total surface area of 75 m\u00b2, maximize diffusion efficiency. Inhaled air, a mixture of gases, has oxygen at a higher partial pressure than oxygen-depleted blood, driving oxygen into pulmonary capillaries where it binds to hemoglobin. Conversely, carbon dioxide, at a higher partial pressure in the blood than in alveolar air, diffuses into the alveoli to be exhaled. This exchange is influenced by atmospheric pressure, gas composition, and factors like the respiratory quotient (RQ), which accounts for the ratio of CO\u2082 produced to O\u2082 consumed and slightly lowers alveolar oxygen levels compared to outside air. The process repeats in systemic circulation, where oxygen diffuses from blood into tissues and carbon dioxide moves from tissues into blood, maintaining homeostasis through continuous cycling between lungs and tissues."

Birds have evolved a respiratory system that supplies them with\n1324\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nthe oxygen needed to enable flying. Similar to mammals, birds have lungs, which are organs specialized for gas exchange.\nOxygenated air, taken in during inhalation, diffuses across the surface of the lungs into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide\ndiffuses from the blood into the lungs and expelled during exhalation. The details of breathing between birds and mammals\ndiffer substantially.\nIn addition to lungs, birds have air sacs inside their body. Air flows in one direction from the posterior air sacs to the lungs\nand out of the anterior air sacs. The flow of air is in the opposite direction from blood flow, and gas exchange takes place\nmuch more efficiently. This type of breathing enables birds to obtain the requisite oxygen, even at higher altitudes where\nthe oxygen concentration is low. This directionality of airflow requires two cycles of air intake and exhalation to completely\nget the air out of the lungs.\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\n1325\nAvian Respiration\nBirds have evolved a respiratory system that enables them to fly. Flying is a high-energy process and\nrequires a lot of oxygen. Furthermore, many birds fly in high altitudes where the concentration of oxygen in\nlow. How did birds evolve a respiratory system that is so unique?\nDecades of research by paleontologists have shown that birds evolved from therapods, meat-eating\ndinosaurs (Figure 30.14). In fact, fossil evidence shows that meat-eating dinosaurs that lived more than 100\nmillion years ago had a similar flow-through respiratory system with lungs and air sacs. Archaeopteryx and\nXiaotingia, for example, were flying dinosaurs and are believed to be early precursors of birds.\nFigure 30.14 (a) Birds have a flow-through respiratory system in which air flows unidirectionally from the posterior\nsacs into the lungs, then into the anterior air sacs. The air sacs connect to openings in hollow bones. (b)\nDinosaurs, from which birds descended, have similar hollow bones and are believed to have had a similar\nrespiratory system. (credit b: modification of work by Zina Deretsky, National Science Foundation)\nMost of us consider that dinosaurs are extinct. However, modern birds are descendants of avian dinosaurs.\nThe respiratory system of modern birds has been evolving for hundreds of millions of years.\n1326\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nRecall the exhalation pathway of birds. What is meant by the statement, \u201cthese animals have a \u2018flow-through\nrespiratory system,\u2019\u201d and how does this aid in flight?\na.\nThe \u201cflow-through respiratory system\u201d allows air to only entirely in one direction, without retracing its\npathway at all, allowing the animal to breathe faster while in flight\nb.\nThe \u201cflow-through respiratory system\u201d contains several air sacs that make the animal lighter compared to\nsimilar-sized animals with no air sacs.\nc.\nThe \u201cflow-through respiratory system\u201d contains many lungs, which allow the animals to take in the large\nquantities of oxygen needed for flight.\nd.\nThe \u201cflow-through respiratory system\u201d allows air to move in an almost unidirectional pathway to reach\na series of air sacs that provide air to hollow bones, making the animals lighter and providing efficient\nrespiration.\nAll mammals have lungs that are the main organs for breathing. Lung capacity has evolved to support the animal\u2019s activities.\nDuring inhalation, the lungs expand with air, and oxygen diffuses across the lung\u2019s surface and enters the bloodstream.\nDuring exhalation, the lungs expel air and lung volume decreases. In the next few sections, the process of human breathing\nwill be explained.\nThe Mechanics of Human Breathing\nBoyle\u2019s Law is the gas law that states that in a closed space, pressure and volume are inversely related. As volume decreases,\npressure increases and vice versa (Figure 30.15). The relationship between gas pressure and volume helps to explain the\nmechanics of breathing.\nFigure 30.15 This graph shows data from Boyle\u2019s original 1662 experiment, which shows that pressure and volume\nare inversely related. No units are given as Boyle used arbitrary units in his experiments.\nThere is always a slightly negative pressure within the thoracic cavity, which aids in keeping the airways of the lungs\nopen. During inhalation, volume increases as a result of contraction of the diaphragm, and pressure decreases (according\nto Boyle\u2019s Law). This decrease of pressure in the thoracic cavity relative to the environment makes the cavity less than\nthe atmosphere (Figure 30.16a). Because of this drop in pressure, air rushes into the respiratory passages. To increase the\nvolume of the lungs, the chest wall expands. This results from the contraction of the intercostal muscles, the muscles that\nare connected to the rib cage. Lung volume expands because the diaphragm contracts and the intercostals muscles contract,\nthus expanding the thoracic cavity. This increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity lowers pressure compared to the\natmosphere, so air rushes into the lungs, thus increasing its volume. The resulting increase in volume is largely attributed to\nan increase in alveolar space, because the bronchioles and bronchi are stiff structures that do not change in size.\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\n1327\nFigure 30.16 The lungs, chest wall, and diaphragm are all involved in respiration, both (a) inhalation and (b) expiration.\nThe chest wall expands out and away from the lungs. The lungs are elastic; therefore, when air fills the lungs, the elastic\nrecoil within the tissues of the lung exerts pressure back toward the interior of the lungs. These outward and inward forces\ncompete to inflate and deflate the lung with every breath. Upon exhalation, the lungs recoil to force the air out of the lungs,\nand the intercostal muscles relax, returning the chest wall back to its original position (Figure 30.16b). The diaphragm\nalso relaxes and moves higher into the thoracic cavity. This increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity relative to\nthe environment, and air rushes out of the lungs. The movement of air out of the lungs is a passive event. No muscles are\ncontracting to expel the air.\nEach lung is surrounded by an invaginated sac. The layer of tissue that covers the lung and dips into spaces is called the\nvisceral pleura. A second layer of parietal pleura lines the interior of the thorax (Figure 30.17). The space between these\nlayers, the intrapleural space, contains a small amount of fluid that protects the tissue and reduces the friction generated\nfrom rubbing the tissue layers together as the lungs contract and relax. Pleurisy results when these layers of tissue become\ninflamed; it is painful because the inflammation increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity and reduces the volume of\nthe lung.\n1328\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 30.17 A tissue layer called pleura surrounds the lung and interior of the thoracic cavity.

Therefore, the lungs control air\npressure by controlling the volume of the thoracic cavity, not vice versa.\nThe Work of Breathing\nThe number of breaths per minute is the respiratory rate. On average, under non-exertion conditions, the human respiratory\nrate is 12\u201315 breaths/minute. The respiratory rate contributes to the alveolar ventilation, or how much air moves into\nand out of the alveoli. Alveolar ventilation prevents carbon dioxide buildup in the alveoli. There are two ways to keep\nthe alveolar ventilation constant: increase the respiratory rate while decreasing the tidal volume of air per breath (shallow\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\n1329\nbreathing), or decrease the respiratory rate while increasing the tidal volume per breath. In either case, the ventilation\nremains the same, but the work done and type of work needed are quite different. Both tidal volume and respiratory rate are\nclosely regulated when oxygen demand increases.\nThere are two types of work conducted during respiration, flow-resistive and elastic work. Flow-resistive refers to the work\nof the alveoli and tissues in the lung, whereas elastic work refers to the work of the intercostal muscles, chest wall, and\ndiaphragm. Increasing the respiration rate increases the flow-resistive work of the airways and decreases the elastic work of\nthe muscles. Decreasing the respiratory rate reverses the type of work required.\nSurfactant\nThe air-tissue/water interface of the alveoli has a high surface tension. This surface tension is similar to the surface tension\nof water at the liquid-air interface of a water droplet that results in the bonding of the water molecules together. Surfactant\nis a complex mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins that works to reduce the surface tension that exists between the\nalveoli tissue and the air found within the alveoli. By lowering the surface tension of the alveolar fluid, it reduces the\ntendency of alveoli to collapse.\nSurfactant works like a detergent to reduce the surface tension and allows for easier inflation of the airways. When a balloon\nis first inflated, it takes a large amount of effort to stretch the plastic and start to inflate the balloon. If a little bit of detergent\nwas applied to the interior of the balloon, then the amount of effort or work needed to begin to inflate the balloon would\ndecrease, and it would become much easier to start blowing up the balloon. This same principle applies to the airways. A\nsmall amount of surfactant to the airway tissues reduces the effort or work needed to inflate those airways. Babies born\nprematurely sometimes do not produce enough surfactant. As a result, they suffer from respiratory distress syndrome,\nbecause it requires more effort to inflate their lungs. Surfactant is also important for preventing collapse of small alveoli\nrelative to large alveoli.\nLung Resistance and Compliance\nPulmonary diseases reduce the rate of gas exchange into and out of the lungs. Two main causes of decreased gas exchange\nare compliance (how elastic the lung is) and resistance (how much obstruction exists in the airways). A change in either\ncan dramatically alter breathing and the ability to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide.\nExamples of restrictive diseases are respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis. In both diseases, the airways are\nless compliant and they are stiff or fibrotic. There is a decrease in compliance because the lung tissue cannot bend and move.\nIn these types of restrictive diseases, the intrapleural pressure is more positive and the airways collapse upon exhalation,\nwhich traps air in the lungs. Forced or functional vital capacity (FVC), which is the amount of air that can be forcibly\nexhaled after taking the deepest breath possible, is much lower than in normal patients, and the time it takes to exhale most\nof the air is greatly prolonged (Figure 30.18). A patient suffering from these diseases cannot exhale the normal amount of\nair.\nObstructive diseases and conditions include emphysema, asthma, and pulmonary edema. In emphysema, which mostly\narises from smoking tobacco, the walls of the alveoli are destroyed, decreasing the surface area for gas exchange. The\noverall compliance of the lungs is increased, because as the alveolar walls are damaged, lung elastic recoil decreases due to a\nloss of elastic fibers, and more air is trapped in the lungs at the end of exhalation. Asthma is a disease in which inflammation\nis triggered by environmental factors. Inflammation obstructs the airways. The obstruction may be due to edema (fluid\naccumulation), smooth muscle spasms in the walls of the bronchioles, increased mucus secretion, damage to the epithelia of\nthe airways, or a combination of these events. Those with asthma or edema experience increased occlusion from increased\ninflammation of the airways. This tends to block the airways, preventing the proper movement of gases (Figure 30.18).\nThose with obstructive diseases have large volumes of air trapped after exhalation and breathe at a very high lung volume\nto compensate for the lack of airway recruitment.\n1330\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 30.18 The ratio of FEV1 (the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled in one second after taking a deep\nbreath) to FVC (the total amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled) can be used to diagnose whether a person has\nrestrictive or obstructive lung disease. In restrictive lung disease, FVC is reduced but airways are not obstructed, so\nthe person is able to expel air reasonably fast. In obstructive lung disease, airway obstruction results in slow exhalation\nas well as reduced FVC. Thus, the FEV1/FVC ratio is lower in persons with obstructive lung disease (less than 69\npercent) than in persons with restrictive disease (88 to 90 percent).\nDead Space: V/Q Mismatch\nPulmonary circulation pressure is very low compared to that of the systemic circulation. It is also independent of cardiac\noutput. This is because of a phenomenon called recruitment, which is the process of opening airways that normally remain\nclosed when cardiac output increases. As cardiac output increases, the number of capillaries and arteries that are perfused\n(filled with blood) increases. These capillaries and arteries are not always in use but are ready if needed. At times, however,\nthere is a mismatch between the amount of air (ventilation, V) and the amount of blood (perfusion, Q) in the lungs. This is\nreferred to as ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch.\nThere are two types of V/Q mismatch. Both produce dead space, regions of broken down or blocked lung tissue. Dead\nspaces can severely impact breathing, because they reduce the surface area available for gas diffusion. As a result, the\namount of oxygen in the blood decreases, whereas the carbon dioxide level increases. Dead space is created when no\nventilation and/or perfusion takes place. Anatomical dead space or anatomical shunt, arises from an anatomical failure,\nwhile physiological dead space or physiological shunt, arises from a functional impairment of the lung or arteries.\nAn example of an anatomical shunt is the effect of gravity on the lungs. The lung is particularly susceptible to changes in the\nmagnitude and direction of gravitational forces. When someone is standing or sitting upright, the pleural pressure gradient\nleads to increased ventilation further down in the lung. As a result, the intrapleural pressure is more negative at the base\nof the lung than at the top, and more air fills the bottom of the lung than the top. Likewise, it takes less energy to pump\nblood to the bottom of the lung than to the top when in a prone position. Perfusion of the lung is not uniform while standing\nor sitting. This is a result of hydrostatic forces combined with the effect of airway pressure. An anatomical shunt develops\nbecause the ventilation of the airways does not match the perfusion of the arteries surrounding those airways. As a result,\nthe rate of gas exchange is reduced. Note that this does not occur when lying down, because in this position, gravity does\nnot preferentially pull the bottom of the lung down.\nA physiological shunt can develop if there is infection or edema in the lung that obstructs an area. This will decrease\nventilation but not affect perfusion; therefore, the V/Q ratio changes and gas exchange is affected.\nThe lung can compensate for these mismatches in ventilation and perfusion. If ventilation is greater than perfusion, the\narterioles dilate and the bronchioles constrict. This increases perfusion and reduces ventilation. Likewise, if ventilation is\nless than perfusion, the arterioles constrict and the bronchioles dilate to correct the imbalance.\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\n1331\nVisit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/breathing) to view the mechanics of breathing.\nHow does the downward movement of the diaphragm allow us to breathe?\na.\nIt reduces the volume of the thoracic cavity, increasing the air pressure in the lungs and triggering inhalation.\nb.\nIt reduces the volume of the thoracic cavity, increasing the air pressure in the lungs and triggering exhalation.\nc.\nIt creates a partial vacuum in the thoracic cavity into which outside air flows during exhalation.\nd.\nIt creates a partial vacuum in the thoracic cavity into which outside air flows during inhalation.\n30.4 | Transport of Gases in Human Bodily Fluids\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow is oxygen bound to hemoglobin and transported to body tissues?\n\u2022\nHow is carbon dioxide transported from body tissues to the lungs?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nGas exchange at the tissue level also occurs by diffusion.

        "summary": "Breathing involves the coordinated action of the lungs, chest wall, and diaphragm to enable gas exchange, with variations across species such as amphibians relying on gills and skin diffusion, and birds using a highly efficient unidirectional flow-through respiratory system with air sacs for flight. In humans, inhalation occurs when diaphragm and intercostal muscle contraction expands the thoracic cavity, lowering pressure and drawing air in, while exhalation is passive as elastic recoil forces air out. The pleura reduces friction during breathing, and surfactant decreases alveolar surface tension to prevent collapse. Breathing efficiency depends on lung compliance and airway resistance, with restrictive diseases (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis) reducing compliance and obstructive diseases (e.g., emphysema, asthma) impeding airflow. Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatches, caused by anatomical or physiological shunts, reduce gas exchange efficiency, but the body can partially compensate by adjusting bronchiole and arteriole diameter to balance airflow and blood flow."

Although gas exchange is a\ncontinuous process, the oxygen and carbon dioxide are transported by different mechanisms.\nTransport of Oxygen in the Blood\nAlthough oxygen dissolves in blood, only a small amount of oxygen is transported this way. Only 1.5 percent of oxygen in\nthe blood is dissolved directly into the blood itself. Most oxygen\u201498.5 percent\u2014is bound to a protein called hemoglobin\nand carried to the tissues.\nHemoglobin\nHemoglobin, or Hb, is a protein molecule found in red blood cells (erythrocytes) made of four subunits: two alpha subunits\nand two beta subunits (Figure 30.19). Each subunit surrounds a central heme group that contains iron and binds one oxygen\nmolecule, allowing each hemoglobin molecule to bind four oxygen molecules. Molecules with more oxygen bound to the\nheme groups are brighter red. As a result, oxygenated arterial blood where the Hb is carrying four oxygen molecules is\nbright red, while venous blood that is deoxygenated is darker red.\nFigure 30.19 The protein inside (a) red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells and carbon dioxide to the lungs is (b)\nhemoglobin. Hemoglobin is made up of four symmetrical subunits and four heme groups. Iron associated with the\nheme binds oxygen. It is the iron in hemoglobin that gives blood its red color.\nIt is easier to bind a second and third oxygen molecule to Hb than the first molecule. This is because the hemoglobin\nmolecule changes its shape, or conformation, as oxygen binds. The fourth oxygen is then more difficult to bind. The binding\nof oxygen to hemoglobin can be plotted as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (x-axis) versus the\nrelative Hb-oxygen saturation (y-axis). The resulting graph\u2014an oxygen dissociation curve\u2014is sigmoidal, or S-shaped\n(Figure 30.20). As the partial pressure of oxygen increases, the hemoglobin becomes increasingly saturated with oxygen.\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\n1333\nFigure 30.20 The oxygen dissociation curve demonstrates that, as the partial pressure of oxygen increases,\nmore oxygen binds hemoglobin. However, the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen may shift to the left or the right\ndepending on environmental conditions.\nThe kidneys are responsible for removing excess hydrogen ions from the blood. If the kidneys fail, what would happen\nto blood pH and hemoglobin affinity for oxygen?\na.\nThe blood pH will drop and hemoglobin affinity for oxygen will increase.\nb.\nThe blood pH will increase and hemoglobin affinity for oxygen will drop.\nc.\nThe blood pH will drop and hemoglobin affinity for oxygen will decrease.\nd.\nThe blood pH will increase and hemoglobin affinity for oxygen will also increase.\nFactors That Affect Oxygen Binding\nThe oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin determines how much oxygen is carried in the blood. In addition to PO2 ,\nother environmental factors and diseases can affect oxygen carrying capacity and delivery.\nCarbon dioxide levels, blood pH, and body temperature affect oxygen-carrying capacity (Figure 30.20). When carbon\ndioxide is in the blood, it reacts with water to form bicarbonate (HCO3\n\u2212) and hydrogen ions (H+). As the level of carbon\ndioxide in the blood increases, more H+ is produced and the pH decreases. This increase in carbon dioxide and subsequent\ndecrease in pH reduce the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. The oxygen dissociates from the Hb molecule, shifting the\noxygen dissociation curve to the right. Therefore, more oxygen is needed to reach the same hemoglobin saturation level\nas when the pH was higher. A similar shift in the curve also results from an increase in body temperature. Increased\ntemperature, such as from increased activity of skeletal muscle, causes the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen to be reduced.\nDiseases like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia decrease the blood\u2019s ability to deliver oxygen to tissues and its oxygen-\ncarrying capacity. In sickle cell anemia, the shape of the red blood cell is crescent-shaped, elongated, and stiffened,\nreducing its ability to deliver oxygen (Figure 30.21). In this form, red blood cells cannot pass through the capillaries. This\nis painful when it occurs. Thalassemia is a rare genetic disease caused by a defect in either the alpha or the beta subunit\nof Hb. Patients with thalassemia produce a high number of red blood cells, but these cells have lower-than-normal levels of\nhemoglobin. Therefore, the oxygen-carrying capacity is diminished.\n1334\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 30.21 Individuals with sickle cell anemia have crescent-shaped red blood cells. (credit: modification of work by\nEd Uthman; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nTransport of Carbon Dioxide in the Blood\nCarbon dioxide molecules are transported in the blood from body tissues to the lungs by one of three methods: dissolution\ndirectly into the blood, binding to hemoglobin, or carried as a bicarbonate ion. Several properties of carbon dioxide in the\nblood affect its transport. First, carbon dioxide is more soluble in blood than oxygen. About 5 to 7 percent of all carbon\ndioxide is dissolved in the plasma. Second, carbon dioxide can bind to plasma proteins or can enter red blood cells and bind\nto hemoglobin. This form transports about 10 percent of the carbon dioxide. When carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin, a\nmolecule called carbaminohemoglobin is formed. Binding of carbon dioxide to hemoglobin is reversible. Therefore, when\nit reaches the lungs, the carbon dioxide can freely dissociate from the hemoglobin and be expelled from the body.\nThird, the majority of carbon dioxide molecules (85 percent) are carried as part of the bicarbonate buffer system.\nIn this system, carbon dioxide diffuses into the red blood cells. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) within the red blood cells\nquickly converts the carbon dioxide into carbonic acid (H2CO3). Carbonic acid is an unstable intermediate molecule\nthat immediately dissociates into bicarbonate ions (HCO3\n\u2212) and hydrogen (H+) ions. Since carbon dioxide is quickly\nconverted into bicarbonate ions, this reaction allows for the continued uptake of carbon dioxide into the blood down its\nconcentration gradient. It also results in the production of H+ ions. If too much H+ is produced, it can alter blood pH.\nHowever, hemoglobin binds to the free H+ ions and thus limits shifts in pH. The newly synthesized bicarbonate ion is\ntransported out of the red blood cell into the liquid component of the blood in exchange for a chloride ion (Cl-); this is\ncalled the chloride shift. When the blood reaches the lungs, the bicarbonate ion is transported back into the red blood cell in\nexchange for the chloride ion. The H+ ion dissociates from the hemoglobin and binds to the bicarbonate ion. This produces\nthe carbonic acid intermediate, which is converted back into carbon dioxide through the enzymatic action of CA. The carbon\ndioxide produced is expelled through the lungs during exhalation.\nCO2  + H2 O \u2194\nH2 CO3\n(carbonic acid) \u2194HCO3  + H+\n(bicarbonate)\n \nThe benefit of the bicarbonate buffer system is that carbon dioxide is \u201csoaked up\u201d into the blood with little change to the pH\nof the system. This is important because it takes only a small change in the overall pH of the body for severe injury or death\nto result. The presence of this bicarbonate buffer system also allows for people to travel and live at high altitudes: When\nthe partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide change at high altitudes, the bicarbonate buffer system adjusts to regulate\ncarbon dioxide while maintaining the correct pH in the body.\nCarbon Monoxide Poisoning\nWhile carbon dioxide can readily associate and dissociate from hemoglobin, other molecules such as carbon monoxide (CO)\ncannot. Carbon monoxide has a greater affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen. Therefore, when carbon monoxide is present,\nit binds to hemoglobin preferentially over oxygen. As a result, oxygen cannot bind to hemoglobin, so very little oxygen\nis transported through the body (Figure 30.22). Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas and is therefore difficult to\ndetect. It is produced by gas-powered vehicles and tools. Carbon monoxide can cause headaches, confusion, and nausea;\nlong-term exposure can cause brain damage or death. Administering 100 percent (pure) oxygen is the usual treatment for\ncarbon monoxide poisoning. Administration of pure oxygen speeds up the separation of carbon monoxide from hemoglobin.\nChapter 30 | The Respiratory System\n1335\nFigure 30.22 As percent CO increases, the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin decreases.\nThink About It\nHow does the administration of 100 percent oxygen save a patient from carbon monoxide poisoning?

        "summary": "In the transport of gases in human bodily fluids, oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the bloodstream, where only 1.5% is dissolved in plasma and the majority (98.5%) binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, each hemoglobin molecule carrying up to four oxygen molecules via its iron-containing heme groups. Hemoglobin\u2019s affinity for oxygen changes as oxygen binds, producing a sigmoidal oxygen dissociation curve, and is influenced by factors such as partial pressure of oxygen, carbon dioxide levels, pH, and temperature; increased CO\u2082, lowered pH, higher temperature, and certain diseases like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia reduce oxygen-binding capacity. Carbon dioxide is transported from tissues to the lungs by dissolving in plasma (5\u20137%), binding to hemoglobin as carbaminohemoglobin (10%), or\u2014most commonly\u2014being converted into bicarbonate ions (85%) via carbonic anhydrase in red blood cells, with the bicarbonate buffer system helping regulate blood pH through reversible reactions and chloride shifts. Unlike CO\u2082, carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin with much higher affinity than oxygen, preventing oxygen transport and posing serious health risks that require treatment with 100% oxygen to rapidly displace CO from hemoglobin."

The circulatory system has evolved over time from simple diffusion through cells in\nthe early evolution of animals to a complex network of blood vessels that reach all parts of the human body. This extensive\nnetwork supplies the cells, tissues, and organs with oxygen and nutrients, and removes carbon dioxide and waste, which are\nbyproducts of respiration.\nAt the core of the human circulatory system is the heart. The size of a clenched fist, the human heart is protected beneath\nthe rib cage. Made of specialized and unique cardiac muscle, it pumps blood throughout the body and to the heart itself.\nHeart contractions are driven by intrinsic electrical impulses that the brain and endocrine hormones help to regulate.\nUnderstanding the heart\u2019s basic anatomy and function is important to understanding the body\u2019s circulatory and respiratory\nsystems. Because one in four deaths in the United States is due to heart disease, billions of dollars are spent each year\nresearching ways to prevent and treat it. For example, researchers have been trying to find a way to get damaged cardiac\nmuscle to repair itself. A team of researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science recently discovered that activating a\nprotein called ERBB2 causes heart cells in adult mice to regenerate. The research team is continuing their research to\ndetermine how this knowledge might be applied to human medicine. You can read more about this exciting research on the\nScience Daily website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32ERBB2) .\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\n1349\n31.1 | Overview of the Circulatory System\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat is the difference between an open circulatory system and a closed circulatory system?\n\u2022\nWhat are the components of interstitial fluid and hemolymph?\n\u2022\nWhat are the differences and similarities among the organization and evolution of different vertebrate circulatory\nsystems?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nMuch of the information in this chapter is not in scope for AP\u00ae. However, the chapter is filled with examples that are\napplicable to concepts we have previously explored. The circulatory system links to all other organ systems. For example,\nnutrients pass from the digestive system into the blood, and the excretory system rids the blood of wastes. In addition,\nbecause heart disease is a leading cause of death in humans, the information is relevant.\nCirculatory systems in animals show a distinct pattern of evolution\u2014from none in sponges and jellyfish to open circulatory\nsystems characteristic of insects to closed circulatory systems with hearts, valves, and vessels in vertebrates. Circulatory\nsystems provide body cells with oxygen and nutrients, remove wastes, transports hormones, protect against invaders, and\naids in temperature regulation. Although some animals such as the sponge have had no adaptive need to develop a complex\ncirculatory system (they exchange nutrients and wastes directly with the environment), as demands for oxygen increased\nwith terrestrial living, natural selection favored a closed circulatory system in which blood is transported in vessels. To\nincrease efficiency, within closed systems the heart evolved from two chambers in fish (one atrium and one ventricle) to the\nfour-chambered heart (two atria and two ventricles) seen in crocodiles, birds, and mammals.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 1 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework.

In all vertebrate organisms, as well as some invertebrates, this is a closed-loop system, in which the blood is\nnot free in a cavity. In a closed circulatory system, blood is contained inside blood vessels and circulates unidirectionally\nfrom the heart around the systemic circulatory route, then returns to the heart again, as illustrated in Figure 31.2a. As\nopposed to a closed system, arthropods\u2014including insects, crustaceans, and most mollusks\u2014have an open circulatory\nsystem, as illustrated in Figure 31.2b. In an open circulatory system, the blood is not enclosed in the blood vessels but is\npumped into a cavity called a hemocoel and is called hemolymph because the blood mixes with the interstitial fluid. As\nthe heart beats and the animal moves, the hemolymph circulates around the organs within the body cavity and then reenters\nthe hearts through openings called ostia. This movement allows for gas and nutrient exchange. An open circulatory system\ndoes not use as much energy as a closed system to operate or to maintain; however, there is a trade-off with the amount of\nblood that can be moved to metabolically active organs and tissues that require high levels of oxygen. In fact, one reason\nthat insects with wing spans of up to two feet wide (70 cm) are not around today is probably because they were outcompeted\nby the arrival of birds 150 million years ago. Birds, having a closed circulatory system, are thought to have moved more\nagilely, allowing them to get food faster and possibly to prey on the insects.\nFigure 31.2 In (a) closed circulatory systems, the heart pumps blood through vessels that are separate from the\ninterstitial fluid of the body. Most vertebrates and some invertebrates, like this annelid earthworm, have a closed\ncirculatory system. In (b) open circulatory systems, a fluid called hemolymph is pumped through a blood vessel that\nempties into the body cavity. Hemolymph returns to the blood vessel through openings called ostia. Arthropods like\nthis bee and most mollusks have open circulatory systems.\nCirculatory System Variation in Animals\nThe circulatory system varies from simple systems in invertebrates to more complex systems in vertebrates. The simplest\nanimals, such as the sponges (Porifera) and rotifers (Rotifera), do not need a circulatory system because diffusion allows\nadequate exchange of water, nutrients, and waste, as well as dissolved gases, as shown in Figure 31.3a. Organisms that\nare more complex but still only have two layers of cells in their body plan, such as jellies (Cnidaria) and comb jellies\n(Ctenophora) also use diffusion through their epidermis and internally through the gastrovascular compartment. Both their\ninternal and external tissues are bathed in an aqueous environment and exchange fluids by diffusion on both sides, as\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\n1351\nillustrated in Figure 31.3b. Exchange of fluids is assisted by the pulsing of the jellyfish body.\nFigure 31.3 Simple animals consisting of a single cell layer such as the (a) sponge or only a few cell layers such as\nthe (b) jellyfish do not have a circulatory system. Instead, gases, nutrients, and wastes are exchanged by diffusion.\nFor more complex organisms, diffusion is not efficient for cycling gases, nutrients, and waste effectively through the\nbody; therefore, more complex circulatory systems evolved. Most arthropods and many mollusks have open circulatory\nsystems. In an open system, an elongated beating heart pushes the hemolymph through the body and muscle contractions\nhelp to move fluids. The larger more complex crustaceans, including lobsters, have developed arterial-like vessels to push\nblood through their bodies, and the most active mollusks, such as squids, have evolved a closed circulatory system and\nare able to move rapidly to catch prey. Closed circulatory systems are a characteristic of vertebrates; however, there are\nsignificant differences in the structure of the heart and the circulation of blood between the different vertebrate groups due\nto adaptation during evolution and associated differences in anatomy. Figure 31.4 illustrates the basic circulatory systems\nof some vertebrates: fish, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals.\n1352\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 31.4 (a) Fish have the simplest circulatory systems of the vertebrates: blood flows unidirectionally from the two-\nchambered heart through the gills and then the rest of the body. (b) Amphibians have two circulatory routes: one for\noxygenation of the blood through the lungs and skin, and the other to take oxygen to the rest of the body. The blood\nis pumped from a three-chambered heart with two atria and a single ventricle. (c) Reptiles also have two circulatory\nroutes; however, blood is only oxygenated through the lungs. The heart is three chambered, but the ventricles are\npartially separated so some mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood occurs except in crocodilians and birds.\n(d) Mammals and birds have the most efficient heart with four chambers that completely separate the oxygenated and\ndeoxygenated blood; it pumps only oxygenated blood through the body and deoxygenated blood to the lungs.\nAs illustrated in Figure 31.4a Fish have a single circuit for blood flow and a two-chambered heart that has only a single\natrium and a single ventricle. The atrium collects blood that has returned from the body and the ventricle pumps the blood to\nthe gills where gas exchange occurs and the blood is re-oxygenated; this is called gill circulation. The blood then continues\nthrough the rest of the body before arriving back at the atrium; this is called systemic circulation. This unidirectional flow\nof blood produces a gradient of oxygenated to deoxygenated blood around the fish\u2019s systemic circuit. The result is a limit in\nthe amount of oxygen that can reach some of the organs and tissues of the body, reducing the overall metabolic capacity of\nfish.\nIn amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, blood flow is directed in two circuits: one through the lungs and back to the\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\n1353\nheart, which is called pulmonary circulation, and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the\nbrain (systemic circulation). In amphibians, gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is\nreferred to as pulmocutaneous circulation.\nAs shown in Figure 31.4b, amphibians have a three-chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the\ntwo-chambered heart of fish. The two atria (superior heart chambers) receive blood from the two different circuits (the\nlungs and the systems), and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart\u2019s ventricle (inferior heart chamber), which\nreduces the efficiency of oxygenation. The advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood\nto the lungs and body. The mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the ventricle that diverts oxygen-rich blood through the\nsystemic circulatory system and deoxygenated blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit. For this reason, amphibians are often\ndescribed as having double circulation.\nMost reptiles also have a three-chambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the pulmonary and\nsystemic circuits, as shown in Figure 31.4c. The ventricle is divided more effectively by a partial septum, which results in\nless mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Some reptiles (alligators and crocodiles) are the most primitive animals\nto exhibit a four-chambered heart. Crocodilians have a unique circulatory mechanism where the heart shunts blood from\nthe lungs toward the stomach and other organs during long periods of submergence, for instance, while the animal waits for\nprey or stays underwater waiting for prey to rot. One adaptation includes two main arteries that leave the same part of the\nheart: one takes blood to the lungs and the other provides an alternate route to the stomach and other parts of the body. Two\nother adaptations include a hole in the heart between the two ventricles, called the foramen of Panizza, which allows blood\nto move from one side of the heart to the other, and specialized connective tissue that slows the blood flow to the lungs.\nTogether these adaptations have made crocodiles and alligators one of the most evolutionarily successful animal groups on\nearth.\nIn mammals and birds, the heart is also divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles, as illustrated in Figure\n31.4d. The oxygenated blood is separated from the deoxygenated blood, which improves the efficiency of double circulation\nand is probably required for the warm-blooded lifestyle of mammals and birds. The four-chambered heart of birds and\nmammals evolved independently from a three-chambered heart. The independent evolution of the same or a similar\nbiological trait is referred to as convergent evolution.\nThink About It\nWhat advantages are supplied by closed circulatory systems with chambered hearts in terrestrial vertebrates?\n31.2 | Components of the Blood\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the basic components of blood?\n\u2022\nWhat are the differences between red blood cells and white blood cells?\n\u2022\nWhat is the difference between blood plasma and blood serum?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nMost of us have suffered a cut or a scraped knee and have seen our own blood. Blood consists of different types of cells\nbathed in a water-based liquid called plasma. Red blood cells are specialized to carry hemoglobin (Hgb), a quaternary\nprotein that transports oxygen and some carbon dioxide around the body, to and from the heart and lungs. Hemoglobin\nalso has an affinity for carbon monoxide, a toxic and deadly gas. Variants of hemoglobin help animals adapt to different\nenvironments. For example, Hgb-S causes sickle-cell anemia; although this variant of hemoglobin is not as efficient at\ntransporting O2, it does provide some protection against malaria, thus providing an advantage to heterozygous individuals.\nAnother variant is Hgb-F or fetal hemoglobin, which transports O2 efficiently in low oxygen conditions.

        "summary": "The circulatory system transports oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and wastes throughout the body, with two main types found in animals: open systems, in which hemolymph flows freely within body cavities, and closed systems, in which blood is contained in vessels. Simple animals like sponges and jellyfish rely on diffusion for exchange, while more complex invertebrates such as insects and mollusks use open systems, and vertebrates generally have closed systems with hearts that evolved in complexity over time. Fish possess a two-chambered heart and single circulation; amphibians and most reptiles have three chambers and double circulation, with partial separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood; crocodilians exhibit four chambers and specialized shunting adaptations; and birds and mammals have fully separated four-chambered hearts, enabling highly efficient double circulation, an adaptation that evolved independently in these groups. The efficiency of closed systems with multi-chambered hearts supports higher metabolic demands, particularly in active and warm-blooded animals."

For example, persons with type A blood have A\nglycoproteins on the surface of their red blood cells. We will take a deeper dive into blood typing, antigens, and antibodies\nwhen we explore the immune system in a later chapter, and we also will learn in that the five types of white blood cells play\nimportant roles in immunity.

The blood is more than the proteins, though. Blood is actually a term\nused to describe the liquid that moves through the vessels and includes plasma (the liquid portion, which contains water,\nproteins, salts, lipids, and glucose) and the cells (red and white cells) and cell fragments called platelets. Blood plasma\nis actually the dominant component of blood and contains the water, proteins, electrolytes, lipids, and glucose. The cells\nare responsible for carrying the gases (red cells) and immune the response (white). The platelets are responsible for blood\nclotting. Interstitial fluid that surrounds cells is separate from the blood, but in hemolymph, they are combined. In humans,\ncellular components make up approximately 45 percent of the blood and the liquid plasma 55 percent. Blood is 20 percent\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\n1355\nof a person\u2019s extracellular fluid and eight percent of weight.\nThe Role of Blood in the Body\nBlood, like the human blood illustrated in Figure 31.5 is important for regulation of the body\u2019s systems and homeostasis.\nBlood helps maintain homeostasis by stabilizing pH, temperature, osmotic pressure, and by eliminating excess heat.\nBlood supports growth by distributing nutrients and hormones, and by removing waste. Blood plays a protective role by\ntransporting clotting factors and platelets to prevent blood loss and transporting the disease-fighting agents or white blood\ncells to sites of infection.\nFigure 31.5 The cells and cellular components of human blood are shown. Red blood cells deliver oxygen to the\ncells and remove carbon dioxide. White blood cells\u2014including neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and\nbasophils\u2014are involved in the immune response. Platelets form clots that prevent blood loss after injury.\nRed Blood Cells\nRed blood cells, or erythrocytes (erythro- = \u201cred\u201d; -cyte = \u201ccell\u201d), are specialized cells that circulate through the body\ndelivering oxygen to cells; they are formed from stem cells in the bone marrow. In mammals, red blood cells are small\nbiconcave cells that at maturity do not contain a nucleus or mitochondria and are only 7\u20138 \u00b5m in size. In birds and non-\navian reptiles, a nucleus is still maintained in red blood cells.\nThe red coloring of blood comes from the iron-containing protein hemoglobin, illustrated in Figure 31.6a. The principal job\nof this protein is to carry oxygen, but it also transports carbon dioxide as well. Hemoglobin is packed into red blood cells at\na rate of about 250 million molecules of hemoglobin per cell. Each hemoglobin molecule binds four oxygen molecules so\nthat each red blood cell carries one billion molecules of oxygen. There are approximately 25 trillion red blood cells in the\nfive liters of blood in the human body, which could carry up to 25 sextillion (25 \u00d7 1021) molecules of oxygen in the body at\nany time. In mammals, the lack of organelles in erythrocytes leaves more room for the hemoglobin molecules, and the lack\nof mitochondria also prevents use of the oxygen for metabolic respiration. Only mammals have anucleated red blood cells,\nand some mammals (camels, for instance) even have nucleated red blood cells. The advantage of nucleated red blood cells\nis that these cells can undergo mitosis. Anucleated red blood cells metabolize anaerobically (without oxygen), making use\nof a primitive metabolic pathway to produce ATP and increase the efficiency of oxygen transport.\nNot all organisms use hemoglobin as the method of oxygen transport. Invertebrates that utilize hemolymph rather than blood\nuse different pigments to bind to the oxygen. These pigments use copper or iron to bind the oxygen. Invertebrates have\na variety of other respiratory pigments. Hemocyanin, a blue-green, copper-containing protein, illustrated in Figure 31.6b\nis found in mollusks, crustaceans, and some of the arthropods. Chlorocruorin, a green-colored, iron-containing pigment is\nfound in four families of polychaete tubeworms. Hemerythrin, a red, iron-containing protein is found in some polychaete\nworms and annelids and is illustrated in Figure 31.6c. Despite the name, hemerythrin does not contain a heme group and\nits oxygen-carrying capacity is poor compared to hemoglobin.\n1356\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 31.6 In most vertebrates, (a) hemoglobin delivers oxygen to the body and removes some carbon dioxide.\nHemoglobin is composed of four protein subunits, two alpha chains and two beta chains, and a heme group that has\niron associated with it. The iron reversibly associates with oxygen, and in so doing is oxidized from Fe2+ to Fe3+. In\nmost mollusks and some arthropods, (b) hemocyanin delivers oxygen. Unlike hemoglobin, hemolymph is not carried in\nblood cells, but floats free in the hemolymph. Copper instead of iron binds the oxygen, giving the hemolymph a blue-\ngreen color. In annelids, such as the earthworm, and some other invertebrates, (c) hemerythrin carries oxygen. Like\nhemoglobin, hemerythrin is carried in blood cells and has iron associated with it, but despite its name, hemerythrin\ndoes not contain heme.\nThe small size and large surface area of red blood cells allows for rapid diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide across the\nplasma membrane. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is taken in by the blood. In the tissues, oxygen is\nreleased from the blood and carbon dioxide is bound for transport back to the lungs. Studies have found that hemoglobin\nalso binds nitrous oxide (NO). NO is a vasodilator that relaxes the blood vessels and capillaries and may help with gas\nexchange and the passage of red blood cells through narrow vessels. Nitroglycerin, a heart medication for angina and heart\nattacks, is converted to NO to help relax the blood vessels and increase oxygen flow through the body.\nA characteristic of red blood cells is their glycolipid and glycoprotein coating; these are lipids and proteins that have\ncarbohydrate molecules attached. In humans, the surface glycoproteins and glycolipids on red blood cells vary between\nindividuals, producing the different blood types, such as A, B, and O. Red blood cells have an average life span of 120 days,\nat which time they are broken down and recycled in the liver and spleen by phagocytic macrophages, a type of white blood\ncell.\nWhite Blood Cells\nWhite blood cells, also called leukocytes (leuko = white), make up approximately one percent by volume of the cells in\nblood. The role of white blood cells is very different than that of red blood cells: they are primarily involved in the immune\nresponse to identify and target pathogens, such as invading bacteria, viruses, and other foreign organisms. White blood cells\nare formed continually; some only live for hours or days, but some live for years.\nThe morphology of white blood cells differs significantly from red blood cells. They have nuclei and do not contain\nhemoglobin. The different types of white blood cells are identified by their microscopic appearance after histologic staining,\nand each has a different specialized function. The two main groups, both illustrated in Figure 31.7 are the granulocytes,\nwhich include the neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, and the agranulocytes, which include the monocytes and\nlymphocytes.\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\n1357\nFigure 31.7 (a) Granulocytes\u2014including neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils\u2014are characterized by a lobed nucleus\nand granular inclusions in the cytoplasm. Granulocytes are typically first-responders during injury or infection. (b)\nAgranulocytes include lymphocytes and monocytes. Lymphocytes, including B and T cells, are responsible for adaptive\nimmune response. Monocytes differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells, which in turn respond to infection or\ninjury.\nGranulocytes contain granules in their cytoplasm; the agranulocytes are so named because of the lack of granules in their\ncytoplasm. Some leukocytes become macrophages that either stay at the same site or move through the blood stream and\ngather at sites of infection or inflammation where they are attracted by chemical signals from foreign particles and damaged\ncells. Lymphocytes are the primary cells of the immune system and include B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells. B\ncells destroy bacteria and inactivate their toxins. They also produce antibodies. T cells attack viruses, fungi, some bacteria,\ntransplanted cells, and cancer cells. T cells attack viruses by releasing toxins that kill the viruses. Natural killer cells attack\na variety of infectious microbes and certain tumor cells.\nOne reason that HIV poses significant management challenges is because the virus directly targets T cells by gaining entry\nthrough a receptor. Once inside the cell, HIV then multiplies using the T cell\u2019s own genetic machinery. After the HIV virus\nreplicates, it is transmitted directly from the infected T cell to macrophages. The presence of HIV can remain unrecognized\nfor an extensive period of time before full disease symptoms develop.\nPlatelets and Coagulation Factors\nBlood must clot to heal wounds and prevent excess blood loss. Small cell fragments called platelets (thrombocytes) are\nattracted to the wound site where they adhere by extending many projections and releasing their contents. These contents\nactivate other platelets and also interact with other coagulation factors, which convert fibrinogen, a water-soluble protein\npresent in blood serum into fibrin (a non-water soluble protein), causing the blood to clot. Many of the clotting factors\nrequire vitamin K to work, and vitamin K deficiency can lead to problems with blood clotting. Many platelets converge and\nstick together at the wound site forming a platelet plug (also called a fibrin clot), as illustrated in Figure 31.8b. The plug or\nclot lasts for a number of days and stops the loss of blood. Platelets are formed from the disintegration of larger cells called\nmegakaryocytes, like that shown in Figure 31.8a. For each megakaryocyte, 2000\u20133000 platelets are formed with 150,000\nto 400,000 platelets present in each cubic millimeter of blood. Each platelet is disc shaped and 2\u20134 \u03bcm in diameter. They\ncontain many small vesicles but do not contain a nucleus.\n1358\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 31.8 (a) Platelets are formed from large cells called megakaryocytes. The megakaryocyte breaks up into\nthousands of fragments that become platelets. (b) Platelets are required for clotting of the blood. The platelets collect\nat a wound site in conjunction with other clotting factors, such as fibrinogen, to form a fibrin clot that prevents blood\nloss and allows the wound to heal.\nPlasma and Serum\nThe liquid component of blood is called plasma, and it is separated by spinning or centrifuging the blood at high rotations\n(3000 rpm or higher). The blood cells and platelets are separated by centrifugal forces to the bottom of a specimen tube.\nThe upper liquid layer, the plasma, consists of 90 percent water along with various substances required for maintaining the\nbody\u2019s pH, osmotic load, and for protecting the body. The plasma also contains the coagulation factors and antibodies.\nThe plasma component of blood without the coagulation factors is called the serum. Serum is similar to interstitial fluid in\nwhich the correct composition of key ions acting as electrolytes is essential for normal functioning of muscles and nerves.\nOther components in the serum include proteins that assist with maintaining pH and osmotic balance while giving viscosity\nto the blood. The serum also contains antibodies, specialized proteins that are important for defense against viruses and\nbacteria. Lipids, including cholesterol, are also transported in the serum, along with various other substances including\nnutrients, hormones, metabolic waste, plus external substances, such as, drugs, viruses, and bacteria.\nHuman serum albumin is the most abundant protein in human blood plasma and is synthesized in the liver. Albumin, which\nconstitutes about half of the blood serum protein, transports hormones and fatty acids, buffers pH, and maintains osmotic\npressures. Immunoglobin is a protein antibody produced in the mucosal lining and plays an important role in antibody\nmediated immunity.\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\n1359\nBlood Types Related to Proteins on the Surface of the Red Blood\nCells\nRed blood cells are coated in antigens made of glycolipids and glycoproteins. The composition of these\nmolecules is determined by genetics, which have evolved over time. In humans, the different surface\nantigens are grouped into 24 different blood groups with more than 100 different antigens on each red\nblood cell. The two most well known blood groups are the ABO, shown in Figure 31.9, and Rh systems.\nThe surface antigens in the ABO blood group are glycolipids, called antigen A and antigen B. People with\nblood type A have antigen A, those with blood type B have antigen B, those with blood type AB have both\nantigens, and people with blood type O have neither antigen. Antibodies called agglutinougens are found in\nthe blood plasma and react with the A or B antigens, if the two are mixed. When type A and type B blood are\ncombined, agglutination (clumping) of the blood occurs because of antibodies in the plasma that bind with\nthe opposing antigen; this causes clots that coagulate in the kidney causing kidney failure. Type O blood\nhas neither A or B antigens, and therefore, type O blood can be given to all blood types. Type O negative\nblood is the universal donor. Type AB positive blood is the universal acceptor because it has both A and B\nantigen. The ABO blood groups were discovered in 1900 and 1901 by Karl Landsteiner at the University of\nVienna.\nThe Rh blood group was first discovered in Rhesus monkeys. Most people have the Rh antigen (Rh+) and\ndo not have anti-Rh antibodies in their blood. The few people who do not have the Rh antigen and are\nRh\u2013 can develop anti-Rh antibodies if exposed to Rh+ blood. This can happen after a blood transfusion\nor after an Rh\u2013 woman has an Rh+ baby. The first exposure does not usually cause a reaction; however,\nat the second exposure, enough antibodies have built up in the blood to produce a reaction that causes\nagglutination and breakdown of red blood cells. An injection can prevent this reaction.\nFigure 31.9 Human red blood cells may have either type A or B glycoproteins on their surface, both glycoproteins\ncombined (AB), or neither (O). The glycoproteins serve as antigens and can elicit an immune response in a person\nwho receives a transfusion containing unfamiliar antigens. Type O blood, which has no A or B antigens, does not\nelicit an immune response when injected into a person of any blood type. Thus, O is considered the universal\ndonor. Persons with type AB blood can accept blood from any blood type, and type AB is considered the universal\nacceptor.\n1360\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nWhich of the following phylogenies, created based on features of the circulatory system of vertebrates, is most\naccurate?\na.\nA\nb.\nB\nc.\nC\nd.\nD\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\n1361\nPlay a blood typing game on the Nobel Prize website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/blood_typing) to solidify your\nunderstanding of blood types.\nThis simplified phylogeny shows the currently accepted evolutionary history of vertebrates, which are part of the phylum\nChordata.

        "summary": "Blood is composed of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, each with specialized functions essential for maintaining homeostasis. Plasma, which makes up about 55% of blood, is mostly water and contains proteins, salts, lipids, glucose, coagulation factors, antibodies, and other substances; plasma without coagulation factors is called serum. Red blood cells, produced in bone marrow and lacking nuclei and mitochondria in mammals, contain hemoglobin to transport oxygen and some carbon dioxide, with surface glycoproteins determining blood types such as ABO and Rh. White blood cells, which comprise about 1% of blood volume, are immune cells that identify and combat pathogens, including granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils) and agranulocytes (monocytes, lymphocytes). Platelets are cell fragments from megakaryocytes that initiate blood clotting by forming plugs with fibrin. Blood types depend on genetically determined surface antigens on red cells, with type O negative as the universal donor and type AB positive as the universal acceptor; Rh incompatibility can cause immune reactions upon repeated exposure. Overall, blood transports gases, nutrients, hormones, and waste, regulates pH, temperature, and osmotic pressure, and protects the body through clotting and immune responses."

This ensures that oxygen-rich blood is delivered to all tissues and cells of the body where it will be used\nfor cellular respiration. Blood returning from the tissues is high in CO2 and low in O2 will return to the heart and be pumped\nto the lungs, where gases are exchanged by diffusion at capillary beds.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 4 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework.

Coronary\ncirculation intrinsic to the heart takes blood directly from the main artery (aorta) coming from the heart. For pulmonary and\nsystemic circulation, the heart has to pump blood to the lungs or the rest of the body, respectively. In vertebrates, the lungs\nare relatively close to the heart in the thoracic cavity. The shorter distance to pump means that the muscle wall on the right\nside of the heart is not as thick as the left side which must have enough pressure to pump blood all the way to your big toe.\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\n1363\nFigure 31.10 The mammalian circulatory system is divided into three circuits: the systemic circuit, the pulmonary\ncircuit, and the coronary circuit. Blood is pumped from veins of the systemic circuit into the right atrium of the\nheart, then into the right ventricle. Blood then enters the pulmonary circuit, and is oxygenated by the lungs. From\nthe pulmonary circuit, blood re-enters the heart through the left atrium. From the left ventricle, blood re-enters the\nsystemic circuit through the aorta and is distributed to the rest of the body. The coronary circuit, which provides\nblood to the heart, is not shown.\nCompare the functions and structures of red and white blood cells.\na.\nRed blood cells lack nuclei at maturity and contain hemoglobin, which distributes oxygen throughout the\nbody.

White blood cells distribute oxygen throughout the\nbody. They have nuclei and lack hemoglobin.\nStructure of the Heart\nThe heart muscle is asymmetrical as a result of the distance blood must travel in the pulmonary and systemic circuits. Since\nthe right side of the heart sends blood to the pulmonary circuit it is smaller than the left side which must send blood out to\nthe whole body in the systemic circuit, as shown in Figure 31.11. In humans, the heart is about the size of a clenched fist; it\nis divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. There is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one\natrium and one ventricle on the left side. The atria are the chambers that receive blood, and the ventricles are the chambers\nthat pump blood. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava, which drains blood from the\njugular vein that comes from the brain and from the veins that come from the arms, as well as from the inferior vena cava\nwhich drains blood from the veins that come from the lower organs and the legs. In addition, the right atrium receives blood\nfrom the coronary sinus which drains deoxygenated blood from the heart itself. This deoxygenated blood then passes to the\n1364\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nright ventricle through the atrioventricular valve or the tricuspid valve, a flap of connective tissue that opens in only one\ndirection to prevent the backflow of blood. The valve separating the chambers on the left side of the heart valve is called the\nbiscuspid or mitral valve. After it is filled, the right ventricle pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries, by-passing\nthe semilunar valve (or pulmonic valve) to the lungs for re-oxygenation. After blood passes through the pulmonary arteries,\nthe right semilunar valves close preventing the blood from flowing backwards into the right ventricle. The left atrium then\nreceives the oxygen-rich blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins. This blood passes through the bicuspid valve or\nmitral valve (the atrioventricular valve on the left side of the heart) to the left ventricle where the blood is pumped out\nthrough aorta, the major artery of the body, taking oxygenated blood to the organs and muscles of the body. Once blood\nis pumped out of the left ventricle and into the aorta, the aortic semilunar valve (or aortic valve) closes preventing blood\nfrom flowing backward into the left ventricle. This pattern of pumping is referred to as double circulation and is found in\nall mammals.\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\n1365\nFigure 31.11 (a) The heart is primarily made of a thick muscle layer, called the myocardium, surrounded by\nmembranes. One-way valves separate the four chambers. (b) Blood vessels of the coronary system, including the\ncoronary arteries and veins, keep the heart musculature oxygenated.\nPlasma and serum are common terms. Both are important parts of blood. What is the difference between blood plasma\nand blood serum?\na.\nBlood plasma is made up of blood serum and other components. Serum is the component of plasma\ncontaining blood coagulation factors.\nb.\nBlood serum is made up of blood plasma and other components.

Serum is the component of plasma, which\nlacks antibodies and hormones.\nThe heart is composed of three layers; the epicardium, the myocardium, and the endocardium, illustrated in Figure 31.11.\nThe inner wall of the heart has a lining called the endocardium. The myocardium consists of the heart muscle cells that\nmake up the middle layer and the bulk of the heart wall. The outer layer of cells is called the epicardium, of which the\nsecond layer is a membranous layered structure called the pericardium that surrounds and protects the heart; it allows\nenough room for vigorous pumping but also keeps the heart in place to reduce friction between the heart and other\nstructures.\nThe heart has its own blood vessels that supply the heart muscle with blood. The coronary arteries branch from the aorta\nand surround the outer surface of the heart like a crown. They diverge into capillaries where the heart muscle is supplied\nwith oxygen before converging again into the coronary veins to take the deoxygenated blood back to the right atrium\nwhere the blood will be re-oxygenated through the pulmonary circuit. The heart muscle will die without a steady supply\nof blood. Atherosclerosis is the blockage of an artery by the buildup of fatty plaques. Because of the size (narrow) of the\ncoronary arteries and their function in serving the heart itself, atherosclerosis can be deadly in these arteries. The slowdown\nof blood flow and subsequent oxygen deprivation that results from atherosclerosis causes severe pain, known as angina, and\ncomplete blockage of the arteries will cause myocardial infarction: the death of cardiac muscle tissue, commonly known\nas a heart attack.\nThe Cardiac Cycle\nThe main purpose of the heart is to pump blood through the body; it does so in a repeating sequence called the cardiac\ncycle. The cardiac cycle is the coordination of the filling and emptying of the heart of blood by electrical signals that\ncause the heart muscles to contract and relax. The human heart beats over 100,000 times per day. In each cardiac cycle,\nthe heart contracts (systole), pushing out the blood and pumping it through the body; this is followed by a relaxation phase\n(diastole), where the heart fills with blood, as illustrated in Figure 31.12. The atria contract at the same time, forcing blood\nthrough the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles. Closing of the atrioventricular valves produces a monosyllabic \u201clup\u201d\nsound. Following a brief delay, the ventricles contract at the same time forcing blood through the semilunar valves into the\naorta and the artery transporting blood to the lungs (via the pulmonary artery). Closing of the semilunar valves produces a\nmonosyllabic \u201cdup\u201d sound.\nFigure 31.12 During (a) atrial diastole, the ventricles contract, forcing blood out of the heart. During (b) cardiac diastole,\nthe heart muscle is relaxed and blood flows into the heart. During (c) atrial systole, the atria contract, pushing blood\ninto the ventricles.\nThe pumping of the heart is a function of the cardiac muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, that make up the heart muscle.\nCardiomyocytes, shown in Figure 31.13, are distinctive muscle cells that are striated like skeletal muscle but pump\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\n1367\nrhythmically and involuntarily like smooth muscle; they are connected by intercalated disks exclusive to cardiac muscle.\nThey are self-stimulated for a period of time and isolated cardiomyocytes will beat if given the correct balance of nutrients\nand electrolytes.\nFigure 31.13 Cardiomyocytes are striated muscle cells found in cardiac tissue. (credit: modification of work by Dr. S.\nGirod, Anton Becker; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nThe autonomous beating of cardiac muscle cells is regulated by the heart\u2019s internal pacemaker that uses electrical signals\nto time the beating of the heart. The electrical signals and mechanical actions, illustrated in Figure 31.14, are intimately\nintertwined. The internal pacemaker starts at the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is located near the wall of the right atrium.\nElectrical charges spontaneously pulse from the SA node causing the two atria to contract in unison. The pulse reaches\na second node, called the atrioventricular (AV) node, between the right atrium and right ventricle where it pauses for\napproximately 0.1 second before spreading to the walls of the ventricles. From the AV node, the electrical impulse enters\nthe bundle of His, then to the left and right bundle branches extending through the interventricular septum. Finally, the\nPurkinje fibers conduct the impulse from the apex of the heart up the ventricular myocardium, and then the ventricles\ncontract. This pause allows the atria to empty completely into the ventricles before the ventricles pump out the blood. The\nelectrical impulses in the heart produce electrical currents that flow through the body and can be measured on the skin using\nelectrodes. This information can be observed as an electrocardiogram (ECG)\u2014a recording of the electrical impulses of\nthe cardiac muscle.\n1368\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 31.14 The beating of the heart is regulated by an electrical impulse that causes the characteristic reading of an\nECG. The signal is initiated at the sinoatrial valve. The signal then (a) spreads to the atria, causing them to contract.\nThe signal is (b) delayed at the atrioventricular node before it is passed on to the (c) heart apex. The delay allows the\natria to relax before the (d) ventricles contract. The final part of the ECG cycle prepares the heart for the next beat.\nVisit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/electric_heart) to see the heart\u2019s \u201cpacemaker\u201d in action.\nSome white blood cells release chemicals upon encountering a pathogen.

In this photo, all four chambers of the heart can be seen.\nFigure 31.15 (credit: Kjetil Lenes, Wikimedia Commons)\nArteries, Veins, and Capillaries\nThe blood from the heart is carried through the body by a complex network of blood vessels (Figure 31.16). Arteries take\nblood away from the heart. The main artery is the aorta that branches into major arteries that take blood to different limbs\nand organs. These major arteries include the carotid artery that takes blood to the brain, the brachial arteries that take blood\nto the arms, and the thoracic artery that takes blood to the thorax and then into the hepatic, renal, and gastric arteries for\nthe liver, kidney, and stomach, respectively. The iliac artery takes blood to the lower limbs. The major arteries diverge into\nminor arteries, and then smaller vessels called arterioles, to reach more deeply into the muscles and organs of the body.\n1370\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 31.16 The major human arteries and veins are shown. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nArterioles diverge into capillary beds. Capillary beds contain a large number (10 to 100) of capillaries that branch among\nthe cells and tissues of the body. Capillaries are narrow-diameter tubes that can fit red blood cells through in single file and\nare the sites for the exchange of nutrients, waste, and oxygen with tissues at the cellular level. Fluid also crosses into the\ninterstitial space from the capillaries. The capillaries converge again into venules that connect to minor veins that finally\nconnect to major veins that take blood high in carbon dioxide back to the heart. Veins are blood vessels that bring blood\nback to the heart. The major veins drain blood from the same organs and limbs that the major arteries supply. Fluid is also\nbrought back to the heart via the lymphatic system.\nThe structure of the different types of blood vessels reflects their function or layers. There are three distinct layers, or tunics,\nthat form the walls of blood vessels (Figure 31.17). The first tunic is a smooth, inner lining of endothelial cells that are\nin contact with the red blood cells. The endothelial tunic is continuous with the endocardium of the heart. In capillaries,\nthis single layer of cells is the location of diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the endothelial cells and red\nblood cells, as well as the exchange site via endocytosis and exocytosis. The movement of materials at the site of capillaries\nis regulated by vasoconstriction, narrowing of the blood vessels, and vasodilation, widening of the blood vessels; this is\nimportant in the overall regulation of blood pressure.\nVeins and arteries both have two further tunics that surround the endothelium: the middle tunic is composed of smooth\nmuscle and the outermost layer is connective tissue (collagen and elastic fibers). The elastic connective tissue stretches\nand supports the blood vessels, and the smooth muscle layer helps regulate blood flow by altering vascular resistance\nthrough vasoconstriction and vasodilation. The arteries have thicker smooth muscle and connective tissue than the veins to\naccommodate the higher pressure and speed of freshly pumped blood. The veins are thinner walled as the pressure and rate\nof flow are much lower. In addition, veins are structurally different than arteries in that veins have valves to prevent the\nbackflow of blood. Because veins have to work against gravity to get blood back to the heart, contraction of skeletal muscle\nassists with the flow of blood back to the heart.\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\n1371\nFigure 31.17 Arteries and veins consist of three layers: an outer tunica externa, a middle tunica media, and an inner\ntunica intima.

However, the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide at\ncapillary beds is an application of diffusion, a phenomenon we explored in detail in an earlier chapter. In addition, because\nmany persons suffer from high blood pressure, often called the \u201csilent killer,\u201d you might find it informative to know how\nblood pressure is regulated and why lack of appropriate regulation is detrimental.\nBlood pressure (BP) is the pressure exerted by blood on the walls of a blood vessel that helps to push blood through\nthe body. Systolic blood pressure measures the amount of pressure that blood exerts on vessels while the heart is beating.\nThe optimal systolic blood pressure is 120 mmHg. Diastolic blood pressure measures the pressure in the vessels between\n1372\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\n",
        "summary": "The mammalian heart is a four-chambered organ made of specialized cardiac muscle that pumps blood through three interconnected circuits: coronary (supplying the heart itself), pulmonary (heart to lungs), and systemic (heart to body). Its structure, including asymmetrical muscle walls, one-way valves, and separate atria and ventricles, ensures efficient double circulation that keeps oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood separate. The heart\u2019s walls consist of the epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium, and it relies on coronary arteries and veins for its own oxygen supply; blockages in these vessels can cause angina or myocardial infarction. The cardiac cycle involves alternating contraction (systole) and relaxation (diastole) phases, producing the \u201club-dup\u201d valve sounds, and is coordinated by an intrinsic electrical conduction system starting at the sinoatrial node, passing through the atrioventricular node, bundle of His, and Purkinje fibers\u2014observable with an electrocardiogram. Blood vessels form an extensive network: arteries (with thick walls for high-pressure flow) carry blood away from the heart, branching into smaller arterioles and thin-walled capillaries where gas and nutrient exchange occur; venules and veins (with thinner walls, lower pressure, and valves to prevent backflow) return blood to the heart, aided by skeletal muscle contractions. All vessels share a common layered structure\u2014endothelium (tunica intima), smooth muscle (tunica media), and connective tissue (tunica externa)\u2014with capillaries composed only of the endothelial layer to allow efficient exchange."

In addition, because\nmany persons suffer from high blood pressure, often called the \u201csilent killer,\u201d you might find it informative to know how\nblood pressure is regulated and why lack of appropriate regulation is detrimental.\nBlood pressure (BP) is the pressure exerted by blood on the walls of a blood vessel that helps to push blood through\nthe body. Systolic blood pressure measures the amount of pressure that blood exerts on vessels while the heart is beating.\nThe optimal systolic blood pressure is 120 mmHg. Diastolic blood pressure measures the pressure in the vessels between\n1372\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nheartbeats. The optimal diastolic blood pressure is 80 mmHg. Many factors can affect blood pressure, such as hormones,\nstress, exercise, eating, sitting, and standing. Blood flow through the body is regulated by the size of blood vessels, by the\naction of smooth muscle, by one-way valves, and by the fluid pressure of the blood itself.\nHow Blood Flows Through the Body\nBlood is pushed through the body by the action of the pumping heart. With each rhythmic pump, blood is pushed under\nhigh pressure and velocity away from the heart, initially along the main artery, the aorta. In the aorta, the blood travels at\n30 cm/sec. As blood moves into the arteries, arterioles, and ultimately to the capillary beds, the rate of movement slows\ndramatically to about 0.026 cm/sec, one-thousand times slower than the rate of movement in the aorta. While the diameter of\neach individual arteriole and capillary is far narrower than the diameter of the aorta, and according to the law of continuity,\nfluid should travel faster through a narrower diameter tube, the rate is actually slower due to the overall diameter of all the\ncombined capillaries being far greater than the diameter of the individual aorta.\nThe slow rate of travel through the capillary beds, which reach almost every cell in the body, assists with gas and nutrient\nexchange and also promotes the diffusion of fluid into the interstitial space. After the blood has passed through the capillary\nbeds to the venules, veins, and finally to the main venae cavae, the rate of flow increases again but is still much slower than\nthe initial rate in the aorta. Blood primarily moves in the veins by the rhythmic movement of smooth muscle in the vessel\nwall and by the action of the skeletal muscle as the body moves. Because most veins must move blood against the pull of\ngravity, blood is prevented from flowing backward in the veins by one-way valves. Because skeletal muscle contraction\naids in venous blood flow, it is important to get up and move frequently after long periods of sitting so that blood will not\npool in the extremities.\nBlood flow through the capillary beds is regulated depending on the body\u2019s needs and is directed by nerve and hormone\nsignals. For example, after a large meal, most of the blood is diverted to the stomach by vasodilation of vessels of the\ndigestive system and vasoconstriction of other vessels. During exercise, blood is diverted to the skeletal muscles through\nvasodilation while blood to the digestive system would be lessened through vasoconstriction. The blood entering some\ncapillary beds is controlled by small muscles, called precapillary sphincters, illustrated in Figure 31.18. If the sphincters\nare open, the blood will flow into the associated branches of the capillary blood. If all of the sphincters are closed, then the\nblood will flow directly from the arteriole to the venule through the thoroughfare channel (see Figure 31.18). These muscles\nallow the body to precisely control when capillary beds receive blood flow. At any given moment only about 5-10% of our\ncapillary beds actually have blood flowing through them.\nFigure 31.18 (a) Precapillary sphincters are rings of smooth muscle that regulate the flow of blood through\ncapillaries; they help control the location of blood flow to where it is needed. (b) Valves in the veins prevent blood\nfrom moving backward.

The loss of the watery plasma creates a hyperosmotic solution\nwithin the capillaries, especially near the venules. This causes about 85% of the plasma that leaves the capillaries to\neventually diffuses back into the capillaries near the venules. The remaining 15% of blood plasma drains out from the\ninterstitial fluid into nearby lymphatic vessels (Figure 31.19). The fluid in the lymph is similar in composition to the\ninterstitial fluid. The lymph fluid passes through lymph nodes before it returns to the heart via the vena cava. Lymph nodes\nare specialized organs that filter the lymph by percolation through a maze of connective tissue filled with white blood cells.\nThe white blood cells remove infectious agents, such as bacteria and viruses, to clean the lymph before it returns to the\nbloodstream. After it is cleaned, the lymph returns to the heart by the action of smooth muscle pumping, skeletal muscle\naction, and one-way valves joining the returning blood near the junction of the venae cavae entering the right atrium of the\nheart.\nFigure 31.19 Fluid from the capillaries moves into the interstitial space and lymph capillaries by diffusion down a\npressure gradient and also by osmosis. Out of 7,200 liters of fluid pumped by the average heart in a day, over 1,500\nliters is filtered.

Animals with longs necks and those\nthat live in cold environments have distinct blood pressure adaptations.\nLong necked animals, such as giraffes, need to pump blood upward from the heart against gravity. The\nblood pressure required from the pumping of the left ventricle would be equivalent to 250 mm Hg (mm Hg\n= millimeters of mercury, a unit of pressure) to reach the height of a giraffe\u2019s head, which is 2.5 meters\nhigher than the heart. However, if checks and balances were not in place, this blood pressure would damage\nthe giraffe\u2019s brain, particularly if it was bending down to drink. These checks and balances include valves\nand feedback mechanisms that reduce the rate of cardiac output. Long-necked dinosaurs such as the\nsauropods had to pump blood even higher, up to ten meters above the heart. This would have required\na blood pressure of more than 600 mm Hg, which could only have been achieved by an enormous heart.\nEvidence for such an enormous heart does not exist and mechanisms to reduce the blood pressure required\ninclude the slowing of metabolism as these animals grew larger. It is likely that they did not routinely feed\non tree tops but grazed on the ground.\nLiving in cold water, whales need to maintain the temperature in their blood. This is achieved by the\nveins and arteries being close together so that heat exchange can occur. This mechanism is called a\ncountercurrent heat exchanger. The blood vessels and the whole body are also protected by thick layers\nof blubber to prevent heat loss. In land animals that live in cold environments, thick fur and hibernation are\nused to retain heat and slow metabolism.\nThe heart is asymmetrical in shape. How does the way that the heart functions determine this feature of the heart\u2019s\nstructure?\na.\nThe right and left sides of the heart are responsible for pumping blood to separate regions of the body\ncovering same distances.\nb.\nThe right side of heart sends blood to the lungs to be deoxygenated in the pulmonary circuit, while the left\nside sends oxygenated blood to the rest of the body in the systemic circuit.\nc.\nThe left side of heart sends blood to the lungs to be oxygenated in the pulmonary circuit, while the right side\nsends blood to the rest of the body in the systemic circuit.\nd.\nThe right side of heart sends blood to the lungs to be oxygenated in the pulmonary circuit, while the left side\nsends blood to the rest of the body in the systemic circuit.\nBlood Pressure\nThe pressure of the blood flow in the body is produced by the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid (blood) against the walls of\nthe blood vessels. Fluid will move from areas of high to low hydrostatic pressures. In the arteries, the hydrostatic pressure\nnear the heart is very high and blood flows to the arterioles where the rate of flow is slowed by the narrow openings of the\narterioles. During systole, when new blood is entering the arteries, the artery walls stretch to accommodate the increase of\npressure of the extra blood; during diastole, the walls return to normal because of their elastic properties. The blood pressure\nof the systole phase and the diastole phase, graphed in Figure 31.20, gives the two pressure readings for blood pressure.\nFor example, 120/80 indicates a reading of 120 mm Hg during the systole and 80 mm Hg during diastole. Throughout the\ncardiac cycle, the blood continues to empty into the arterioles at a relatively even rate. This resistance to blood flow is called\nperipheral resistance.\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\n1375\nFigure 31.20 Blood pressure is related to the blood velocity in the arteries and arterioles. In the capillaries and veins,\nthe blood pressure continues to decease but velocity increases.\nBlood Pressure Regulation\nCardiac output is the volume of blood pumped by the heart in one minute. It is calculated by multiplying the number of\nheart contractions that occur per minute (heart rate) times the stroke volume (the volume of blood pumped into the aorta\nper contraction of the left ventricle). Therefore, cardiac output can be increased by increasing heart rate, as when exercising.\nHowever, cardiac output can also be increased by increasing stroke volume, such as if the heart contracts with greater\nstrength. Stroke volume can also be increased by speeding blood circulation through the body so that more blood enters the\nheart between contractions. During heavy exertion, the blood vessels relax and increase in diameter, offsetting the increased\nheart rate and ensuring adequate oxygenated blood gets to the muscles. Stress triggers a decrease in the diameter of the\nblood vessels, consequently increasing blood pressure. These changes can also be caused by nerve signals or hormones, and\neven standing up or lying down can have a great effect on blood pressure.\n1376\nChapter 31 | The Circulatory System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nangina\naorta\narteriole\nartery\natherosclerosis\natrioventricular valve\natrium\nbicuspid valve\nblood pressure (BP)\ncapillary\ncapillary bed\ncardiac cycle\ncardiac output\ncardiomyocyte\nclosed circulatory system\ncoronary artery\ncoronary vein\ndiastole\ndouble circulation\nelectrocardiogram (ECG)\nendocardium\nepicardium\ngill circulation\nhemocoel\nhemolymph\ninferior vena cava\nKEY TERMS\npain caused by partial blockage of the coronary arteries by the buildup of plaque and lack of oxygen to the heart\nmuscle\nmajor artery of the body that takes blood away from the heart\nsmall vessel that connects an artery to a capillary bed\nblood vessel that takes blood away from the heart\nbuildup of fatty plaques in the coronary arteries in the heart\none-way membranous flap of connective tissue between the atrium and the ventricle in the right\nside of the heart;

        "summary": "Blood flow is driven by the heart\u2019s pumping action, propelling blood at high pressure and velocity from the aorta through progressively narrower arteries and arterioles, slowing greatly in the extensive capillary networks to allow gas, nutrient, and fluid exchange with tissues before returning via venules, veins, and the venae cavae at reduced speed. Veins rely on smooth and skeletal muscle action plus one-way valves to move blood, often against gravity, and blood distribution to different organs is controlled by vasodilation, vasoconstriction, and precapillary sphincters in response to nerve and hormone signals. Fluid exchange at capillaries results in most plasma reentering the bloodstream, while excess fluid enters the lymphatic system, where lymph nodes filter pathogens before returning it to circulation. Blood pressure\u2014measured as systolic during heartbeats and diastolic between beats\u2014is influenced by vessel diameter, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance, with regulation affected by factors such as exercise, stress, posture, and temperature adaptations in various animals. Cardiac output depends on heart rate and stroke volume, and can adjust via stronger contractions, faster circulation, or vessel relaxation, while stress or other stimuli may cause vasoconstriction, increasing blood pressure."

In order to achieve a\nhealthy balance, the human body should excrete the eight to ten glasses of water every day. This occurs via the processes\nof urination, defecation, sweating and, to a small extent, respiration. The organs and tissues of the human body are soaked\nin fluids that are maintained at constant temperature, pH, and solute concentration, all crucial elements of homeostasis. The\nsolutes in body fluids are mainly mineral salts and sugars, and osmotic regulation is the process by which the mineral salts\nand water are kept in balance. Osmotic homeostasis is maintained despite the influence of external factors like temperature,\ndiet, and weather conditions.\nOsmotic balance is especially important in the brain. The brain is 80% water, and osmotic balance between water and spinal\nfluid is critical to proper brain function. Too much or too little water can cause severe medical conditions. Researchers have\nrecently discovered the mechanism that controls water flow between brain cells. The speed of water flow is controlled by\nwater channels called aquaporin channels, which are controlled by a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid. You\ncan read more about this interesting research at the Science Daily website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32brain) .\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\n1393\n32.1 | Osmoregulation and Osmotic Balance\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhy are osmoregulation and osmotic balance important to body functions?\n\u2022\nWhat is osmolarity and how is it measured?\n\u2022\nWhat are osmoregulators or osmoconformers, and how do these tools allow animals to adapt to different\nenvironments?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nMuch of the information in this chapter is not within the scope for AP\u00ae. However, the chapter is filled with illustrative\nexamples that are applicable to concepts we\u2019ve explored previously, including chemistry, structure of the plasma cell\nmembrane, and movement of molecules across membranes. With this in mind, it is helpful to have a general understanding\nhow the human body, specifically the excretory system, maintains osmotic homeostasis despite the influence of external\nfactors like temperature, diet, and varying environmental conditions. For example, if we drink eight to ten glasses of water\nper day, the human body excretes that water via urination, defecation, sweating, and, to a small extent, respiration.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework.

Osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water balance (osmotic balance)\nacross membranes within the body\u2019s fluids, which are composed of water, plus electrolytes and non-electrolytes. An\n1394\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nelectrolyte is a solute that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water. A non-electrolyte, in contrast, doesn\u2019t dissociate\ninto ions during water dissolution. Both electrolytes and non-electrolytes contribute to the osmotic balance. The body\u2019s\nfluids include blood plasma, the cytosol within cells, and interstitial fluid, the fluid that exists in the spaces between cells\nand tissues of the body. The membranes of the body (such as the pleural, serous, and cell membranes) are semi-permeable\nmembranes. Semi-permeable membranes are permeable (or permissive) to certain types of solutes and water. Solutions\non two sides of a semi-permeable membrane tend to equalize in solute concentration by movement of solutes and/or water\nacross the membrane. As seen in Figure 32.2, a cell placed in water tends to swell due to gain of water from the hypotonic\nor \u201clow salt\u201d environment. A cell placed in a solution with higher salt concentration, on the other hand, tends to make\nthe membrane shrivel up due to loss of water into the hypertonic or \u201chigh salt\u201d environment. Isotonic cells have an equal\nconcentration of solutes inside and outside the cell; this equalizes the osmotic pressure on either side of the cell membrane\nwhich is a semi-permeable membrane.\nFigure 32.2 Cells placed in a hypertonic environment tend to shrink due to loss of water. In a hypotonic environment,\ncells tend to swell due to intake of water. The blood maintains an isotonic environment so that cells neither shrink nor\nswell. (credit: Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nThe body does not exist in isolation. There is a constant input of water and electrolytes into the system. While\nosmoregulation is achieved across membranes within the body, excess electrolytes and wastes are transported to the kidneys\nand excreted, helping to maintain osmotic balance.\nNeed for Osmoregulation\nBiological systems constantly interact and exchange water and nutrients with the environment by way of consumption of\nfood and water and through excretion in the form of sweat, urine, and feces. Without a mechanism to regulate osmotic\npressure, or when a disease damages this mechanism, there is a tendency to accumulate toxic waste and water, which can\nhave dire consequences.\nMammalian systems have evolved to regulate not only the overall osmotic pressure across membranes, but also specific\nconcentrations of important electrolytes in the three major fluid compartments: blood plasma, extracellular fluid, and\nintracellular fluid. Since osmotic pressure is regulated by the movement of water across membranes, the volume of the fluid\ncompartments can also change temporarily. Because blood plasma is one of the fluid components, osmotic pressures have a\ndirect bearing on blood pressure.\nTransport of Electrolytes across Cell Membranes\nElectrolytes, such as sodium chloride, ionize in water, meaning that they dissociate into their component ions. In water,\nsodium chloride (NaCl), dissociates into the sodium ion (Na+) and the chloride ion (Cl\u2013). The most important ions,\nwhose concentrations are very closely regulated in body fluids, are the cations sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium\n(Ca+2), magnesium (Mg+2), and the anions chloride (Cl\u2013), carbonate (CO3\u20132), bicarbonate (HCO3\u2013), and phosphate(PO3\u2013).\nElectrolytes are lost from the body during urination and perspiration. For this reason, athletes are encouraged to replace\nelectrolytes and fluids during periods of increased activity and perspiration.\nOsmotic pressure is influenced by the concentration of solutes in a solution. It is directly proportional to the number of\nsolute atoms or molecules and not dependent on the size of the solute molecules. Because electrolytes dissociate into their\ncomponent ions, they, in essence, add more solute particles into the solution and have a greater effect on osmotic pressure,\nper mass than compounds that do not dissociate in water, such as glucose.\nWater can pass through membranes by passive diffusion. If electrolyte ions could passively diffuse across membranes, it\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\n1395\nwould be impossible to maintain specific concentrations of ions in each fluid compartment therefore they require special\nmechanisms to cross the semi-permeable membranes in the body. This movement can be accomplished by facilitated\ndiffusion and active transport. Facilitated diffusion requires protein-based channels for moving the solute. Active transport\nrequires energy in the form of ATP conversion, carrier proteins, or pumps in order to move ions against the concentration\ngradient.\nConcept of Osmolality and Milliequivalent\nIn order to calculate osmotic pressure, it is necessary to understand how solute concentrations are measured. The unit for\nmeasuring solutes is the mole. One mole is defined as the gram molecular weight of the solute. For example, the molecular\nweight of sodium chloride is 58.44. Thus, one mole of sodium chloride weighs 58.44 grams. The molarity of a solution is\nthe number of moles of solute per liter of solution. The molality of a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram\nof solvent. If the solvent is water, one kilogram of water is equal to one liter of water. While molarity and molality are used\nto express the concentration of solutions, electrolyte concentrations are usually expressed in terms of milliequivalents per\nliter (mEq/L): the mEq/L is equal to the ion concentration (in millimoles) multiplied by the number of electrical charges on\nthe ion. The unit of milliequivalent takes into consideration the ions present in the solution (since electrolytes form ions in\naqueous solutions) and the charge on the ions.\nThus, for ions that have a charge of one, one milliequivalent is equal to one millimole. For ions that have a charge of two\n(like calcium), one milliequivalent is equal to 0.5 millimoles. Another unit for the expression of electrolyte concentration is\nthe milliosmole (mOsm), which is the number of milliequivalents of solute per kilogram of solvent. Body fluids are usually\nmaintained within the range of 280 to 300 mOsm.\nOsmoregulators and Osmoconformers\nPersons lost at sea without any fresh water to drink are at risk of severe dehydration because the human body cannot adapt\nto drinking seawater, which is hypertonic in comparison to body fluids. Organisms such as goldfish that can tolerate only\na relatively narrow range of salinity are referred to as stenohaline. About 90 percent of all bony fish are restricted to either\nfreshwater or seawater. They are incapable of osmotic regulation in the opposite environment. It is possible, however, for\na few fishes like salmon to spend part of their life in fresh water and part in sea water. Organisms like the salmon and\nmolly that can tolerate a relatively wide range of salinity are referred to as euryhaline organisms. This is possible because\nsome fish have evolved osmoregulatory mechanisms to survive in all kinds of aquatic environments. When they live in\nfresh water, their bodies tend to take up water because the environment is relatively hypotonic, as illustrated in Figure\n32.3a. In such hypotonic environments, these fish do not drink much water. Instead, they pass a lot of very dilute urine,\nand they achieve electrolyte balance by active transport of salts through the gills. When they move to a hypertonic marine\nenvironment, these fish start drinking sea water; they excrete the excess salts through their gills and their urine, as illustrated\nin Figure 32.3b. Most marine invertebrates, on the other hand, may be isotonic with sea water (osmoconformers). Their\nbody fluid concentrations conform to changes in seawater concentration. Cartilaginous fishes\u2019 salt composition of the blood\nis similar to bony fishes; however, the blood of sharks contains the organic compounds urea and trimethylamine oxide\n(TMAO). This does not mean that their electrolyte composition is similar to that of sea water. They achieve isotonicity\nwith the sea by storing large concentrations of urea. These animals that secrete urea are called ureotelic animals. TMAO\nstabilizes proteins in the presence of high urea levels, preventing the disruption of peptide bonds that would occur in other\nanimals exposed to similar levels of urea.

When kidney function fails, dialysis must be done to artificially rid the body of wastes. This is\na vital process to keep patients alive. In some cases, the patients undergo artificial dialysis until they are\neligible for a kidney transplant. In others who are not candidates for kidney transplants, dialysis is a life-long\nnecessity.\nDialysis technicians typically work in hospitals and clinics. While some roles in this field include equipment\ndevelopment and maintenance, most dialysis technicians work in direct patient care. Their on-the-job\nduties, which typically occur under the direct supervision of a registered nurse, focus on providing dialysis\ntreatments. This can include reviewing patient history and current condition, assessing and responding to\npatient needs before and during treatment, and monitoring the dialysis process. Treatment may include\ntaking and reporting a patient\u2019s vital signs and preparing solutions and equipment to ensure accurate and\nsterile procedures.\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\n1397\nPatients undergoing dialysis use dialysis machines such as the one shown here.

        "summary": "Osmoregulation is the process of maintaining the balance of water and salts (osmotic balance) in the body\u2019s fluids, which is crucial for homeostasis and proper functioning of organs like the brain. Body fluids, including blood plasma, cytosol, and interstitial fluid, contain electrolytes (ions) and non-electrolytes that contribute to osmotic pressure across semi-permeable membranes. This regulation prevents harmful fluid and electrolyte imbalances that can arise from interactions with the environment through food, water intake, and excretion. Electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride are tightly controlled, moving across membranes via facilitated diffusion or active transport. Osmotic pressure depends on solute concentration, measured using units like milliequivalents and milliosmoles, with body fluids typically maintained at 280\u2013300 mOsm. Organisms adapt to different salinities through varying strategies: osmoregulators actively maintain internal balance, while osmoconformers\u2019 body fluids match their environment. Some, like salmon, can tolerate a range of salinities (euryhaline), adjusting mechanisms for freshwater or marine conditions, while others (stenohaline) cannot. Special adaptations, such as sharks\u2019 use of urea and TMAO, also play a role. In humans, when kidney function fails, dialysis can substitute for natural osmoregulatory and excretory functions by using semi-permeable membranes to remove urea from the blood."

Although the curriculum does not require you to\nhave detailed knowledge about the structure and physiology of the kidneys, learning how we filter blood to eliminate\nwastes\u2014while also retaining vital water and other substances\u2014provides an opportunity to apply concepts we\u2019ve explored\npreviously. Lack of kidney function can have detrimental effects on our health.\nIn coordination with the circulatory and endocrine systems, the human excretory system serves several functions: excretion\nof metabolic wastes, maintenance of water-salt balance (osmoregulation), maintenance of pH balance, and production of\nhormones. The organs of the system are the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra. Specialized cells of the kidney\ncalled nephrons (not to be confused with neurons of the nervous system) are closely associated with capillaries. Urine\nformation by nephrons involves three steps: filtration, in which water, nutrients, and wastes pass from the blood into the\nnephron; reabsorption, in which nutrients such as glucose and most water are reabsorbed back into the blood; and secretion,\nin which additional wastes and H+ are added to urine to maintain homeostatic pH. The processes of diffusion, osmosis, and\nactive transport ensure that the urine excreted from the body is hypertonic, thus preventing dehydration. For example, water\nis reabsorbed throughout nephron tubules back into capillaries via osmosis, and in another part of the tubule (ascending\nloop of Henle), Na+ and Cl\u2013 are actively transported into the interstitial fluid.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 4 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework. The AP\u00ae Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent\nfoundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP\u00ae exam\nquestions.

Water and\nelectrolytes are lost through sweat glands in the skin, which helps moisturize and cool the skin surface, while the lungs\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\n1399\nexpel a small amount of water in the form of mucous secretions and via evaporation of water vapor.\nKidneys: The Main Osmoregulatory Organ\nThe kidneys, illustrated in Figure 32.5, are a pair of bean-shaped structures that are located just below and posterior to the\nliver in the peritoneal cavity. The adrenal glands sit on top of each kidney and are also called the suprarenal glands. Kidneys\nfilter blood and purify it. All the blood in the human body is filtered many times a day by the kidneys; these organs use\nup almost 25 percent of the oxygen absorbed through the lungs to perform this function. Oxygen allows the kidney cells\nto efficiently manufacture chemical energy in the form of ATP through aerobic respiration. The filtrate coming out of the\nkidneys is called urine.\nFigure 32.5 Kidneys filter the blood, producing urine that is stored in the bladder prior to elimination through the\nurethra. (credit: modification of work by NCI)\nKidney Structure\nExternally, the kidneys are surrounded by three layers, illustrated in Figure 32.6. The outermost layer is a tough connective\ntissue layer called the renal fascia. The second layer is called the perirenal fat capsule, which helps anchor the kidneys\nin place. The third and innermost layer is the renal capsule. Internally, the kidney has three regions\u2014an outer cortex, a\nmedulla in the middle, and the renal pelvis in the region called the hilum of the kidney. The hilum is the concave part of\nthe bean-shape where blood vessels and nerves enter and exit the kidney; it is also the point of exit for the ureters. The renal\ncortex is granular due to the presence of nephrons\u2014the functional unit of the kidney. The medulla consists of multiple\npyramidal tissue masses, called the renal pyramids. In between the pyramids are spaces called renal columns through\nwhich the blood vessels pass. The tips of the pyramids, called renal papillae, point toward the renal pelvis. There are, on\naverage, eight renal pyramids in each kidney. The renal pyramids along with the adjoining cortical region are called the\nlobes of the kidney. The renal pelvis leads to the ureter on the outside of the kidney. On the inside of the kidney, the renal\npelvis branches out into two or three extensions called the major calyces, which further branch into the minor calyces. The\nureters are urine-bearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the urinary bladder.\n1400\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 32.6 The internal structure of the kidney is shown.

Renal blood supply starts with the\nbranching of the aorta into the renal arteries (which are each named based on the region of the kidney they pass through)\nand ends with the exiting of the renal veins to join the inferior vena cava. The renal arteries split into several segmental\narteries upon entering the kidneys. Each segmental artery splits further into several interlobar arteries and enters the renal\ncolumns, which supply the renal lobes. The interlobar arteries split at the junction of the renal cortex and medulla to form the\narcuate arteries. The arcuate \u201cbow shaped\u201d arteries form arcs along the base of the medullary pyramids. Cortical radiate\narteries, as the name suggests, radiate out from the arcuate arteries. The cortical radiate arteries branch into numerous\nafferent arterioles, and then enter the capillaries supplying the nephrons. Veins trace the path of the arteries and have similar\nnames, except there are no segmental veins.\nAs mentioned previously, the functional unit of the kidney is the nephron, illustrated in Figure 32.7. Each kidney is made up\nof over one million nephrons that dot the renal cortex, giving it a granular appearance when sectioned sagittally. There are\ntwo types of nephrons\u2014cortical nephrons (85 percent), which are deep in the renal cortex, and juxtamedullary nephrons\n(15 percent), which lie in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla. A nephron consists of three parts\u2014a renal corpuscle,\na renal tubule, and the associated capillary network, which originates from the cortical radiate arteries.\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\n1401\nFigure 32.7 The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney. The glomerulus and convoluted tubules are located\nin the kidney cortex, while collecting ducts are located in the pyramids of the medulla.

The first part is called the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) due to its proximity to the glomerulus;\nit stays in the renal cortex. The second part is called the loop of Henle, or nephritic loop, because it forms a loop (with\ndescending and ascending limbs) that goes through the renal medulla. The third part of the renal tubule is called the distal\nconvoluted tubule (DCT) and this part is also restricted to the renal cortex. The DCT, which is the last part of the nephron,\nconnects and empties its contents into collecting ducts that line the medullary pyramids. The collecting ducts amass contents\nfrom multiple nephrons and fuse together as they enter the papillae of the renal medulla.\nCapillary Network within the Nephron\nThe capillary network that originates from the renal arteries supplies the nephron with blood that needs to be filtered. The\nbranch that enters the glomerulus is called the afferent arteriole. The branch that exits the glomerulus is called the efferent\narteriole. Within the glomerulus, the network of capillaries is called the glomerular capillary bed. Once the efferent arteriole\nexits the glomerulus, it forms the peritubular capillary network, which surrounds and interacts with parts of the renal\ntubule. In cortical nephrons, the peritubular capillary network surrounds the PCT and DCT. In juxtamedullary nephrons, the\nperitubular capillary network forms a network around the loop of Henle and is called the vasa recta.\n1402\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nGo to this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/kidney_section) to see another coronal section of the kidney and to\nexplore an animation of the workings of nephrons.\nDescribe the structure of the kidneys.\na.\nExternally, the kidneys are surrounded by three layers.

Internally, the kidney has three layers:\nan outer cortex, the middle hilum, and the inner renal pelvis.\nKidney Function and Physiology\nKidneys filter blood in a three-step process. First, the nephrons filter blood that runs through the capillary network in the\nglomerulus. Almost all solutes, except for proteins, are filtered out into the glomerulus by a process called glomerular\nfiltration. Second, the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules. Most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the PCT by a process\ncalled tubular reabsorption. In the loop of Henle, the filtrate continues to exchange solutes and water with the renal\nmedulla and the peritubular capillary network. Water is also reabsorbed during this step. Then, additional solutes and\nwastes are secreted into the kidney tubules during tubular secretion, which is, in essence, the opposite process to tubular\nreabsorption. The collecting ducts collect filtrate coming from the nephrons and fuse in the medullary papillae. From here,\nthe papillae deliver the filtrate, now called urine, into the minor calyces that eventually connect to the ureters through the\nrenal pelvis. This entire process is illustrated in Figure 32.8.\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\n1403\nFigure 32.8 Each part of the nephron performs a different function in filtering waste and maintaining homeostatic\nbalance. (1) The glomerulus forces small solutes out of the blood by pressure. (2) The proximal convoluted tubule\nreabsorbs ions, water, and nutrients from the filtrate into the interstitial fluid, and actively transports toxins and drugs\nfrom the interstitial fluid into the filtrate. The proximal convoluted tubule also adjusts blood pH by selectively secreting\nammonia (NH3) into the filtrate, where it reacts with H+ to form NH4+. The more acidic the filtrate, the more ammonia\nis secreted. (3) The descending loop of Henle is lined with cells containing aquaporins that allow water to pass from\nthe filtrate into the interstitial fluid. (4) In the thin part of the ascending loop of Henle, Na+ and Cl\u2013 ions diffuse into the\ninterstitial fluid. In the thick part, these same ions are actively transported into the interstitial fluid. Because salt but not\nwater is lost, the filtrate becomes more dilute as it travels up the limb. (5) In the distal convoluted tubule, K+ and H+ ions\nare selectively secreted into the filtrate, while Na+, Cl\u2013, and HCO3\u2013 ions are reabsorbed to maintain pH and electrolyte\nbalance in the blood. (6) The collecting duct reabsorbs solutes and water from the filtrate, forming dilute urine. (credit:\nmodification of work by NIDDK)\nGlomerular Filtration\nGlomerular filtration filters out most of the solutes due to high blood pressure and specialized membranes in the afferent\narteriole. The blood pressure in the glomerulus is maintained independent of factors that affect systemic blood pressure.\nThe \u201cleaky\u201d connections between the endothelial cells of the glomerular capillary network allow solutes to pass through\neasily. All solutes in the glomerular capillaries, except for macromolecules like proteins, pass through by passive diffusion.\nThere is no energy requirement at this stage of the filtration process. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the volume\nof glomerular filtrate formed per minute by the kidneys. GFR is regulated by multiple mechanisms and is an important\nindicator of kidney function.\n1404\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nTo learn more about the vascular system of kidneys, click through this review (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/kidneys)\nand the steps of blood flow.\nExplain the three-step process by which the kidneys filter blood.\na.\nFirst, the nephrons filter blood that runs through the capillary network in the glomerulus, which filters out\nalmost all solutes, except for proteins, by glomerular filtration.

Third,\nadditional solutes and wastes are secreted into the tubules of the kidney during tubular secretion.\nTubular Reabsorption and Secretion\nTubular reabsorption occurs in the PCT part of the renal tubule. Almost all nutrients are reabsorbed, and this occurs either\nby passive or active transport. Reabsorption of water and some key electrolytes are regulated and can be influenced by\nhormones. Sodium (Na+) is the most abundant ion and most of it is reabsorbed by active transport and then transported to\nthe peritubular capillaries. Because Na+ is actively transported out of the tubule, water follows it to even out the osmotic\npressure. Water is also independently reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries due to the presence of aquaporins, or water\nchannels, in the PCT. This occurs due to the low blood pressure and high osmotic pressure in the peritubular capillaries.\nHowever, every solute has a transport maximum and the excess is not reabsorbed.\nIn the loop of Henle, the permeability of the membrane changes. The descending limb is permeable to water, not solutes;\nthe opposite is true for the ascending limb. Additionally, the loop of Henle invades the renal medulla, which is naturally\nhigh in salt concentration and tends to absorb water from the renal tubule and concentrate the filtrate. The osmotic gradient\nincreases as it moves deeper into the medulla. Because two sides of the loop of Henle perform opposing functions, as\nillustrated in Figure 32.9, it acts as a countercurrent multiplier. The vasa recta around it acts as the countercurrent\nexchanger.\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\n1405\nFigure 32.9 The loop of Henle acts as a countercurrent multiplier that uses energy to create concentration\ngradients. The descending limb is water permeable. Water flows from the filtrate to the interstitial fluid, so\nosmolality inside the limb increases as it descends into the renal medulla. At the bottom, the osmolality is higher\ninside the loop than in the interstitial fluid. Thus, as filtrate enters the ascending limb, Na+ and Cl\u2013 ions exit through\nion channels present in the cell membrane. Further up, Na+ is actively transported out of the filtrate and Cl\u2013\nfollows. Osmolarity is given in units of milliosmoles per liter (mOsm/L).\nA drug has a side effect that increases the frequency of urination. What might cause this?\na.\nThe drug is most likely an oliguric used to treat hypertension. The oliguric is probably working on the loop\nof Henle and is inhibiting the reabsorption of Na+ and Cl- .\nb.\nThe drug is most likely a diuretic used to treat hypotension. The diuretic is probably working on the loop of\nHenle and is inhibiting the reabsorption of Na+ and Cl-.\nc.\nThe drug is most likely an oliguric used to treat hypotension.

The diuretic is probably working on the loop of\nHenle and is inhibiting the reabsorption of Na+ and Cl-.\nBy the time the filtrate reaches the DCT, most of the urine and solutes have been reabsorbed. If the body requires additional\nwater, all of it can be reabsorbed at this point. Further reabsorption is controlled by hormones, which will be discussed in a\nlater section. Excretion of wastes occurs due to lack of reabsorption combined with tubular secretion. Undesirable products\nlike metabolic wastes, urea, uric acid, and certain drugs, are excreted by tubular secretion. Most of the tubular secretion\nhappens in the DCT, but some occurs in the early part of the collecting duct. Kidneys also maintain an acid-base balance by\nsecreting excess H+ ions.\nAlthough parts of the renal tubules are named proximal and distal, in a cross-section of the kidney, the tubules are placed\nclose together and in contact with each other and the glomerulus. This allows for exchange of chemical messengers between\nthe different cell types. For example, the DCT ascending limb of the loop of Henle has masses of cells called macula densa,\nwhich are in contact with cells of the afferent arterioles called juxtaglomerular cells. Together, the macula densa and\njuxtaglomerular cells form the juxtaglomerular complex (JGC). The JGC is an endocrine structure that secretes the enzyme\nrenin and the hormone erythropoietin. When hormones trigger the macula densa cells in the DCT due to variations in blood\nvolume, blood pressure, or electrolyte balance, these cells can immediately communicate the problem to the capillaries in\nthe afferent and efferent arterioles, which can constrict or relax to change the glomerular filtration rate of the kidneys.\n1406\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nNephrologist\nA nephrologist studies and deals with diseases of the kidneys\u2014both those that cause kidney failure (such as\ndiabetes) and the conditions that are produced by kidney disease (such as hypertension). Blood pressure,\nblood volume, and changes in electrolyte balance come under the purview of a nephrologist.\nNephrologists usually work with other physicians who refer patients to them or consult with them about\nspecific diagnoses and treatment plans. Patients are usually referred to a nephrologist for symptoms such\nas blood or protein in the urine, very high blood pressure, kidney stones, or renal failure.\nNephrology is a subspecialty of internal medicine. To become a nephrologist, medical school is followed\nby additional training to become certified in internal medicine. An additional two or more years is spent\nspecifically studying kidney disorders and their accompanying effects on the body.\nThink About It\nWhat special adaptations do organs of the excretory system have for the excretion of wastes? Loop diuretics are drugs\nsometimes used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).These drugs inhibit the reabsorption of Na+ and Cl\u2013 ions\nby the ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the nephron. A side effect is that they increase urination. Why do you\nthink this is the case?\n32.3 | Excretion Systems\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow do vacuoles, present in microorganisms, work to excrete waste?\n\u2022\nHow do flame cells and nephridia in worms perform excretory functions and maintain osmotic balance?\n\u2022\nHow do insects use Malpighian tubules to excrete wastes and maintain osmotic balance?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe information in this section is not within the scope for AP\u00ae other than to appreciate that other organisms, including\nmicroorganisms and invertebrate animals, use more primitive and simple mechanisms to get rid of metabolic waste and\nmaintain osmotic balance. For example, contractile vacuoles are common in microorganisms; flame cells and nephridia in\ncertain species and worms, and Malpighian tubules in insects are other examples of excretory systems. Osmoregulation is\nvital for all organisms to maintain homeostasis.\nInformation presented and examples highlighted in this section are not within the scope for AP\u00ae and do not align to the\nCurriculum Framework.\nContractile Vacuoles in Microorganisms\nThe most fundamental feature of life is the presence of a cell. In other words, a cell is the simplest functional unit of a\nlife. Bacteria are unicellular, prokaryotic organisms that have some of the least complex life processes in place; however,\nprokaryotes such as bacteria do not contain membrane-bound vacuoles. The cells of microorganisms like bacteria, protozoa,\nand fungi are bound by cell membranes and use them to interact with the environment. Some cells, including some\nleucocytes in humans, are able to engulf food by endocytosis\u2014the formation of vesicles by involution of the cell membrane\nwithin the cells. The same vesicles are able to interact and exchange metabolites with the intracellular environment. In\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\n1407\n",

Urine formation occurs in three steps: glomerular filtration of most solutes except proteins into the Bowman\u2019s capsule; tubular reabsorption of useful nutrients, water, and electrolytes\u2014primarily in the proximal convoluted tubule and modulated in the loop of Henle through countercurrent multiplication; and tubular secretion of wastes and excess ions, largely in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts. This finely tuned process ensures the excretion of hypertonic urine to conserve water, regulated by diffusion, osmosis, active transport, and hormonal control. The kidneys also contain the juxtaglomerular complex, which aids in regulating blood pressure, blood volume, and electrolyte balance via endocrine signaling."

        "text": "Nephrologist\nA nephrologist studies and deals with diseases of the kidneys\u2014both those that cause kidney failure (such as\ndiabetes) and the conditions that are produced by kidney disease (such as hypertension). Blood pressure,\nblood volume, and changes in electrolyte balance come under the purview of a nephrologist.\nNephrologists usually work with other physicians who refer patients to them or consult with them about\nspecific diagnoses and treatment plans. Patients are usually referred to a nephrologist for symptoms such\nas blood or protein in the urine, very high blood pressure, kidney stones, or renal failure.\nNephrology is a subspecialty of internal medicine. To become a nephrologist, medical school is followed\nby additional training to become certified in internal medicine. An additional two or more years is spent\nspecifically studying kidney disorders and their accompanying effects on the body.\nThink About It\nWhat special adaptations do organs of the excretory system have for the excretion of wastes? Loop diuretics are drugs\nsometimes used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).These drugs inhibit the reabsorption of Na+ and Cl\u2013 ions\nby the ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the nephron. A side effect is that they increase urination. Why do you\nthink this is the case?\n32.3 | Excretion Systems\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow do vacuoles, present in microorganisms, work to excrete waste?\n\u2022\nHow do flame cells and nephridia in worms perform excretory functions and maintain osmotic balance?\n\u2022\nHow do insects use Malpighian tubules to excrete wastes and maintain osmotic balance?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe information in this section is not within the scope for AP\u00ae other than to appreciate that other organisms, including\nmicroorganisms and invertebrate animals, use more primitive and simple mechanisms to get rid of metabolic waste and\nmaintain osmotic balance. For example, contractile vacuoles are common in microorganisms; flame cells and nephridia in\ncertain species and worms, and Malpighian tubules in insects are other examples of excretory systems. Osmoregulation is\nvital for all organisms to maintain homeostasis.\nInformation presented and examples highlighted in this section are not within the scope for AP\u00ae and do not align to the\nCurriculum Framework.\nContractile Vacuoles in Microorganisms\nThe most fundamental feature of life is the presence of a cell. In other words, a cell is the simplest functional unit of a\nlife. Bacteria are unicellular, prokaryotic organisms that have some of the least complex life processes in place; however,\nprokaryotes such as bacteria do not contain membrane-bound vacuoles. The cells of microorganisms like bacteria, protozoa,\nand fungi are bound by cell membranes and use them to interact with the environment. Some cells, including some\nleucocytes in humans, are able to engulf food by endocytosis\u2014the formation of vesicles by involution of the cell membrane\nwithin the cells. The same vesicles are able to interact and exchange metabolites with the intracellular environment. In\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\n1407\nsome unicellular eukaryotic organisms such as the amoeba, shown in Figure 32.10, cellular wastes and excess water are\nexcreted by exocytosis, when the contractile vacuoles merge with the cell membrane and expel wastes into the environment.\nContractile vacuoles (CV) should not be confused with vacuoles, which store food or water.\nFigure 32.10 Some unicellular organisms, such as the amoeba, ingest food by endocytosis. The food vesicle fuses\nwith a lysosome, which digests the food. Waste is excreted by exocytosis.\nFlame Cells of Planaria and Nephridia of Worms\nAs multi-cellular systems evolved to have organ systems that divided the metabolic needs of the body, individual organs\nevolved to perform the excretory function. Planaria are flatworms that live in fresh water. Their excretory system consists of\ntwo tubules connected to a highly branched duct system. The cells in the tubules are called flame cells (or protonephridia)\nbecause they have a cluster of cilia that looks like a flickering flame when viewed under the microscope, as illustrated\nin Figure 32.11a. The cilia propel waste matter down the tubules and out of the body through excretory pores that open\non the body surface; cilia also draw water from the interstitial fluid, allowing for filtration. Any valuable metabolites are\nrecovered by reabsorption. Flame cells are found in flatworms, including parasitic tapeworms and free-living planaria. They\nalso maintain the organism\u2019s osmotic balance.\nFigure 32.11 In the excretory system of the (a) planaria, cilia of flame cells propel waste through a tubule formed\nby a tube cell. Tubules are connected into branched structures that lead to pores located all along the sides of the\nbody. The filtrate is secreted through these pores. In (b) annelids such as earthworms, nephridia filter fluid from the\ncoelom, or body cavity. Beating cilia at the opening of the nephridium draw water from the coelom into a tubule. As\nthe filtrate passes down the tubules, nutrients and other solutes are reabsorbed by capillaries. Filtered fluid containing\nnitrogenous and other wastes is stored in a bladder and then secreted through a pore in the side of the body.\nEarthworms (annelids) have slightly more evolved excretory structures called nephridia, illustrated in Figure 32.11b. A\npair of nephridia is present on each segment of the earthworm. They are similar to flame cells in that they have a tubule\nwith cilia. Excretion occurs through a pore called the nephridiopore. They are more evolved than the flame cells in that\nthey have a system for tubular reabsorption by a capillary network before excretion.\nMalpighian Tubules of Insects\nMalpighian tubules are found lining the gut of some species of arthropods, such as the bee illustrated in Figure 32.12. They\nare usually found in pairs and the number of tubules varies with the species of insect. Malpighian tubules are convoluted,\nwhich increases their surface area, and they are lined with microvilli for reabsorption and maintenance of osmotic balance.\nMalpighian tubules work cooperatively with specialized glands in the wall of the rectum. Body fluids are not filtered as\n1408\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nin the case of nephridia; urine is produced by tubular secretion mechanisms by the cells lining the Malpighian tubules that\nare bathed in hemolymph (a mixture of blood and interstitial fluid that is found in insects and other arthropods as well as\nmost mollusks). Metabolic wastes like uric acid freely diffuse into the tubules. There are exchange pumps lining the tubules,\nwhich actively transport H+ ions into the cell and K+ or Na+ ions out; water passively follows to form urine. The secretion\nof ions alters the osmotic pressure which draws water, electrolytes, and nitrogenous waste (uric acid) into the tubules. Water\nand electrolytes are reabsorbed when these organisms are faced with low-water environments, and uric acid is excreted as a\nthick paste or powder. Not dissolving wastes in water helps these organisms to conserve water; this is especially important\nfor life in dry environments.\nFigure 32.12 Malpighian tubules of insects and other terrestrial arthropods remove nitrogenous wastes and other\nsolutes from the hemolymph. Na+ and/or K+ ions are actively transported into the lumen of the tubules. Water then\nenters the tubules via osmosis, forming urine. The urine passes through the intestine, and into the rectum. There,\nnutrients diffuse back into the hemolymph. Na+ and/or K+ ions are pumped into the hemolymph, and water follows. The\nconcentrated waste is then excreted.\nVisit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/malpighian) to see a dissected cockroach, including a close-up look at its\nMalpighian tubules.\nWhat are Malpighian tubules and which organism possesses them?\na.\nMalpighian tubules are the tubules within a nephron in humans.\nb.\nMalpighian tubules are the opening of the digestive sac in box jellyfish.\nc.\nMalpighian tubules are organs that filter waste from hemolymph in cockroaches.\nd.\nMalpighian tubules are tiny, bulb-shaped organs that open to an excretory pore in leeches.\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\n1409\n32.4 | Nitrogenous Wastes\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the differences in the ways aquatic animals and terrestrial animals can eliminate toxic ammonia from\ntheir systems?\n\u2022\nWhat are the major byproducts of ammonia metabolism in mammals compared to fish, reptiles, birds, and insects?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nMuch information in this section is outside the scope for AP\u00ae.

        "summary": "Excretion systems in various organisms range from simple cellular mechanisms to more complex organ structures, all serving to remove metabolic waste and maintain osmotic balance. In some unicellular eukaryotes like amoebas, contractile vacuoles expel excess water and waste via exocytosis, while bacteria and other microorganisms rely on their cell membranes for environmental interaction. Flatworms such as planaria possess flame cells\u2014cilia-lined tubules that filter and propel waste out through body pores, also aiding in osmotic regulation; similar but more advanced nephridia in annelids like earthworms filter fluid from the coelom, reabsorb useful solutes via a capillary network, and expel waste through nephridiopores. Insects use Malpighian tubules, which work with the rectum to actively secrete ions and wastes like uric acid into the tubules from the surrounding hemolymph, draw in water osmotically, reabsorb water and electrolytes when needed, and excrete concentrated nitrogenous waste in a semi-solid form, an adaptation important for conserving water in dry environments."

Urea is made in the liver and\nexcreted in urine. The overall chemical reaction by which ammonia is converted to urea is 2 NH3 (ammonia) + CO2 + 3\nATP + H2O \u2192 H2N-CO-NH2 (urea) + 2 ADP + 4 Pi + AMP.\nThe urea cycle utilizes five intermediate steps, catalyzed by five different enzymes, to convert ammonia to urea, as shown\nin Figure 32.13. The amino acid L-ornithine gets converted into different intermediates before being regenerated at the end\nof the urea cycle. Hence, the urea cycle is also referred to as the ornithine cycle. The enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase\ncatalyzes a key step in the urea cycle and its deficiency can lead to accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia in the body.\nThe first two reactions occur in the mitochondria and the last three reactions occur in the cytosol. Urea concentration in the\nblood, called blood urea nitrogen or BUN, is used as an indicator of kidney function.\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\n1411\nFigure 32.13 The urea cycle converts ammonia to urea.\nExcretion of Nitrogenous Waste\nThe theory of evolution proposes that life started in an aquatic environment. It is not surprising to see\nthat biochemical pathways like the urea cycle evolved to adapt to a changing environment when terrestrial\nlife forms evolved. Arid conditions probably led to the evolution of the uric acid pathway as a means of\nconserving water.\nNitrogenous waste is eliminated in which forms?\na.\nammonia and K+ only\nb.\nuric acid and urea only\nc.\nurea, uric acid, and K+\nd.\nurea, uric acid, and ammonia\n1412\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nNitrogenous Waste in Birds and Reptiles: Uric Acid\nBirds, reptiles, and most terrestrial arthropods convert toxic ammonia to uric acid or the closely related compound guanine\n(guano) instead of urea. Mammals also form some uric acid during breakdown of nucleic acids. Uric acid is a compound\nsimilar to purines found in nucleic acids. It is water insoluble and tends to form a white paste or powder; it is excreted\nby birds, insects, and reptiles. Conversion of ammonia to uric acid requires more energy and is much more complex than\nconversion of ammonia to urea Figure 32.14.\nFigure 32.14 Nitrogenous waste is excreted in different forms by different species. These include (a) ammonia, (b)\nurea, and (c) uric acid. (credit a: modification of work by Eric Engbretson, USFWS; credit b: modification of work by B.\n\"Moose\" Peterson, USFWS; credit c: modification of work by Dave Menke, USFWS)\nGout\nMammals use uric acid crystals as an antioxidant in their cells. However, too much uric acid tends to form\nkidney stones and may also cause a painful condition called gout, where uric acid crystals accumulate in the\njoints, as illustrated in Figure 32.15. Food choices that reduce the amount of nitrogenous bases in the diet\nhelp reduce the risk of gout. For example, tea, coffee, and chocolate have purine-like compounds, called\nxanthines, and should be avoided by people with gout and kidney stones.\nFigure 32.15 Gout causes the inflammation visible in this person\u2019s left big toe joint.

For AP\u00ae, you do not need to memorize the list of hormones\nthat control osmoregulatory functions or their specific function(s). However, information in this section applies to concepts\npreviously explored.\nThe kidneys synchronize with hormonal cues. As you recall from our study of the endocrine system, hormones are small\nmessenger molecules that travel in the bloodstream to affect a target cell. Different regions of the nephron have specialized\ncells with receptors to respond to chemical messengers and hormones. Table 32.1 summarizes the hormones that control the\nosmoregulatory functions. For example, the flight/flight hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine, released by the adrenal\nmedulla and nervous subsystem, respectively, halt kidney function temporarily when the body is under extreme stress and\nmuch of the body\u2019s energy is used to combat imminent danger. Another example is the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone\nsystem that increases blood pressure and volume primarily by constricting blood vessels. Another hormone, antidiuretic\nhormone (ADH) increases membrane permeability to water in the collecting ducts of the nephron by adding aquaporins,\ncausing more water to be reabsorbed. You\u2019ve experienced the effects of ADH when it\u2019s hot outside and you\u2019re running\naround the athletic field; since you\u2019re losing water by sweating and breathing hard, ADH prevents you from losing more\nwater in urine and risking dehydration.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework.

They are the flight/\nfight hormones that are released when the body is under extreme stress. During stress, much of the body\u2019s energy is used\nto combat imminent danger. Kidney function is halted temporarily by epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones\nfunction by acting directly on the smooth muscles of blood vessels to constrict them. Once the afferent arterioles are\nconstricted, blood flow into the nephrons stops. These hormones go one step further and trigger the renin-angiotensin-\naldosterone system.\nRenin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone\nThe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, illustrated in Figure 32.16 proceeds through several steps to produce\nangiotensin II, which acts to stabilize blood pressure and volume. Renin (secreted by a part of the juxtaglomerular\ncomplex) is produced by the granular cells of the afferent and efferent arterioles. Thus, the kidneys control blood\npressure and volume directly. Renin acts on angiotensinogen, which is made in the liver and converts it to angiotensin I.\nAngiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II raises blood pressure by\nconstricting blood vessels. It also triggers the release of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which in\nturn stimulates the renal tubules to reabsorb more sodium. Angiotensin II also triggers the release of anti-diuretic hormone\n(ADH) from the hypothalamus, leading to water retention in the kidneys. It acts directly on the nephrons and decreases\nglomerular filtration rate. Medically, blood pressure can be controlled by drugs that inhibit ACE (called ACE inhibitors).\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\n1415\nFigure 32.16 The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system increases blood pressure and volume.

(credit: modification of work by Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m)\nMineralocorticoids\nMineralocorticoids are hormones synthesized by the adrenal cortex that affect osmotic balance. Aldosterone is a\nmineralocorticoid that regulates sodium levels in the blood. Almost all of the sodium in the blood is reclaimed by the renal\ntubules under the influence of aldosterone. Because sodium is always reabsorbed by active transport and water follows\nsodium to maintain osmotic balance, aldosterone manages not only sodium levels but also the water levels in body fluids.\nIn contrast, the aldosterone also stimulates potassium secretion concurrently with sodium reabsorption. In contrast, absence\nof aldosterone means that no sodium gets reabsorbed in the renal tubules and all of it gets excreted in the urine. In addition,\nthe daily dietary potassium load is not secreted and the retention of K+ can cause a dangerous increase in plasma K+\nconcentration. Patients who have Addison's disease have a failing adrenal cortex and cannot produce aldosterone. They lose\nsodium in their urine constantly, and if the supply is not replenished, the consequences can be fatal.\nAntidiurectic Hormone\nAs previously discussed, antidiuretic hormone or ADH (also called vasopressin), as the name suggests, helps the body\nconserve water when body fluid volume, especially that of blood, is low. It is formed by the hypothalamus and is stored\nand released from the posterior pituitary. It acts by inserting aquaporins in the collecting ducts and promotes reabsorption\nof water. ADH also acts as a vasoconstrictor and increases blood pressure during hemorrhaging.\nAtrial Natriuretic Peptide Hormone\nThe atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) lowers blood pressure by acting as a vasodilator. It is released by cells in the atrium\nof the heart in response to high blood pressure and in patients with sleep apnea. ANP affects salt release, and because water\npassively follows salt to maintain osmotic balance, it also has a diuretic effect. ANP also prevents sodium reabsorption by\nthe renal tubules, decreasing water reabsorption (thus acting as a diuretic) and lowering blood pressure. Its actions suppress\nthe actions of aldosterone, ADH, and renin.\nThink About It\nCreate a diagram to show an example of a hormone and how the hormone works in regulating an osmoregulatory\nprocess such as maintaining blood pressure and blood volume and altering kidney function to reduce the amount of\nwater eliminated in urine.\n1416\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nafferent arteriole\nammonia\nammonotelic\nangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)\nangiotensin I\nangiotensin II\nanti-diuretic hormone (ADH)\nantioxidant\narcuate artery\nascending limb\nblood urea nitrogen (BUN)\nBowman's capsule\ncalyx\ncortex (animal)\ncortical nephron\ncortical radiate artery\ncountercurrent exchanger\ncountercurrent multiplier\ndescending limb\ndistal convoluted tubule (DCT)\nefferent arteriole\nelectrolyte\nflame cell\nglomerular filtration\nglomerular filtration rate (GFR)\nglomerulus (renal)\nhilum\ninferior vena cava\ninterlobar artery\njuxtaglomerular cell\njuxtamedullary nephron\nKEY TERMS\narteriole that branches from the cortical radiate artery and enters the glomerulus\ncompound made of one nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms\ndescribes an animal that excretes ammonia as the primary waste material\nenzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II\nproduct in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway\nmolecule that affects different organs to increase blood pressure\nhormone that prevents the loss of water\nagent that prevents cell destruction by reactive oxygen species\nartery that branches from the interlobar artery and arches over the base of the renal pyramids\npart of the loop of Henle that ascends from the renal medulla to the renal cortex\nestimate of urea in the blood and an indicator of kidney function\nstructure that encloses the glomerulus\nstructure that connects the renal pelvis to the renal medulla\nouter layer of an organ like the kidney or adrenal gland\nnephron that lies in the renal cortex\nartery that radiates from the arcuate arteries into the renal cortex\nperitubular capillary network that allows exchange of solutes and water from the renal\ntubules\nosmotic gradient in the renal medulla that is responsible for concentration of urine\npart of the loop of Henle that descends from the renal cortex into the renal medulla\npart of the renal tubule that is the most distant from the glomerulus\narteriole that exits from the glomerulus\nsolute that breaks down into ions when dissolved in water\n(also, protonephridia) excretory cell found in flatworms\nfiltration of blood in the glomerular capillary network into the glomerulus\namount of filtrate formed by the glomerulus per minute\npart of the renal corpuscle that contains the capillary network\nregion in the renal pelvis where blood vessels, nerves, and ureters bunch before entering or exiting the kidney\none of the main veins in the human body\nartery that branches from the segmental artery and travels in between the renal lobes\ncell in the afferent and efferent arterioles that responds to stimuli from the macula densa\nnephron that lies in the cortex but close to the renal medulla\nChapter 32 | Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\n1417\nkidney\nlobes of the kidney\nloop of Henle\nmacula densa\nMalpighian tubule\nmedulla\nmicrovilli\nmolality\nmolarity\nmole\nnephridia\nnephridiopore\nnephron\nnon-electrolyte\nosmoconformer\nosmoregulation\nosmoregulator\nosmotic balance\nosmotic pressure\nperirenal fat capsule\nperitubular capillary network\nproximal convoluted tubule (PCT)\nrenal artery\nrenal capsule\nrenal column\nrenal corpuscle\nrenal fascia\nrenal pelvis\nrenal pyramid\nrenal tubule\norgan that performs excretory and osmoregulatory functions\nrenal pyramid along with the adjoining cortical region\npart of the renal tubule that loops into the renal medulla\ngroup of cells that senses changes in sodium ion concentration;

        "summary": "Hormonal control of osmoregulatory functions involves the coordination between the kidneys and various hormones to maintain water and solute balance, regulate blood pressure, and control waste elimination. Epinephrine and norepinephrine, released during stress, temporarily reduce kidney function by constricting blood vessels and can activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). In RAAS, renin from the kidneys converts liver-produced angiotensinogen into angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II by ACE; angiotensin II raises blood pressure by constricting vessels, stimulates aldosterone release to promote sodium (and water) reabsorption, and induces ADH release to conserve water. Aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid from the adrenal cortex, regulates sodium and water retention while promoting potassium secretion, with deficiencies leading to dangerous electrolyte imbalances as seen in Addison\u2019s disease. ADH, produced by the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary, increases water reabsorption in the kidneys by inserting aquaporins into collecting ducts and also acts as a vasoconstrictor during blood loss. Conversely, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), released by the heart atria in response to high blood pressure, lowers blood pressure via vasodilation, increasing glomerular filtration, and reducing sodium and water reabsorption, opposing the actions of aldosterone, ADH, and renin."

A host is the organism that is invaded and often harmed by a pathogen. Pathogens include bacteria, protists, fungi\nand other infectious organisms. We are constantly exposed to pathogens in food and water, on surfaces, and in the air.\nMammalian immune systems evolved for protection from such pathogens; they are composed of an extremely diverse\narray of specialized cells and soluble molecules that coordinate a rapid and flexible defense system capable of providing\nprotection from a majority of these disease agents.\nVaccines were developed to reduce the chance of infection of a particular disease, such as measles, mumps, polio, or chicken\npox, by assisting the body to develop immunity. However, many diseases still do not have a vaccine, such as the deadly\ndisease caused by the Ebola virus. Data from the World Health Organization indicates that more than 11,000 people died\nout of over 27,000 cases reported during the 2014\u20132015 outbreak. Though the majority of the cases were in Africa, Ebola\ndid spread to other countries and prompted researchers to try to find a treatment. You can read more about this research at\nthe Science Daily website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32ebolavirus) .\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\n1437\n33.1 | Innate Immune Response\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are examples of physical and chemical immune barriers?\n\u2022\nWhat are the immediate and induced immune responses?\n\u2022\nWhat are natural killer cells, and what is their role in immunity?\n\u2022\nWhat are the features of histocompatibility class I molecules?\n\u2022\nHow do the proteins in a complement system function to destroy extracellular pathogens?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nMuch of the information about the different organ systems of vertebrate animals is not within the scope for AP\u00ae. The\nimmune system, however, was chosen for in-depth exploration because all organisms, including humans, must maintain\ndynamic homeostasis to survive within changing environments. Even the simplest multicellular eukaryotes like sponges\nand cnidarians have developed cells that specialize in immune defenses to protect against disruptions to homeostasis. News\nheadlines warn us of outbreaks of diseases, including Ebola, measles, flu, and insect-borne viruses such as West Nile\nand chikungunya, that spread rapidly through populations, often with devastating consequences. We also hear about the\nemergence of new infections, especially ones caused by bacteria that have evolved resistance to antibiotics.\nImmune systems in animals range from a loose cluster of phagocytic cells in sponges to complex interactions of molecules,\ncells, tissues, and organs that provide immunity in mammals. Components of the immune system constantly search the\nbody for signs of disease-causing microorganisms called pathogens. Immune factors mobilize, identify the nature of the\npathogen, strengthen the corresponding cells and molecules to combat the infection, and then halt the immune response after\nthe infection is cleared to avoid unnecessary host cell damage. Because of its programmable memory system, the immune\nsystem can remember pathogens and initiate a more rapid response upon re-exposure. The immune response can be either\ninnate or adaptive. The adaptive immune response stores information about past infections and mounts pathogen-specific\ndefense. The innate immune response is always present and defends against all pathogens.\nDespite the barriers of skin, tears, and mucus, pathogens may still enter the body. The innate immune system responds with\ninflammation, pathogen engulfment, and secretion of immune factors and proteins. Several types of cells are involved in\nthe innate immune system, including mast cells that release histamines (causing those annoying symptoms associated with\nallergies and colds), macrophages that consume pathogens and cancer cells, natural killer (NK) cells that destroy tumor cells\nand virus-infected cells, several types of white blood cells, and even protective proteins like complement and interferon. We\nknow from experience, however, that these barriers can fail. Fortunately, adaptive immune responses provide another, more\nspecific line of defense.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework. The AP\u00ae Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent\nfoundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP\u00ae exam\nquestions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.\nBig Idea 2\nBiological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to\nreproduce, and to maintain dynamic homeostasis.\nEnduring\nUnderstanding 2.D\nGrowth and dynamic homeostasis of a biological system are influenced by changes in\nthe system\u2019s environment.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n2.D.4 Plants and animals have a variety of chemical defenses against infections that\naffect dynamic homeostasis.\nScience Practice\n1.1 The student can create representations and models of natural or man-made\nphenomena and systems in the domain.\nScience Practice\n1.2 The student can describe representations and models of natural or man-made\nphenomena and systems in the domain.\n1438\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nLearning Objective 2.30 The student can create representations or models to describe nonspecific immune\ndefenses in animals.\nThe immune system comprises both innate and adaptive immune responses. Innate immunity occurs naturally because of\ngenetic factors or physiology; it is not induced by infection or vaccination but works to reduce the workload for the adaptive\nimmune response. Both the innate and adaptive levels of the immune response involve secreted proteins, receptor-mediated\nsignaling, and intricate cell-to-cell communication. The innate immune system developed early in animal evolution, roughly\na billion years ago, as an essential response to infection. Innate immunity has a limited number of specific targets: any\npathogenic threat triggers a consistent sequence of events that can identify the type of pathogen and either clear the infection\nindependently or mobilize a highly specialized adaptive immune response. For example, tears and mucus secretions contain\nmicrobicidal factors.\nPhysical and Chemical Barriers\nBefore any immune factors are triggered, the skin functions as a continuous, impassable barrier to potentially infectious\npathogens. Pathogens are killed or inactivated on the skin by desiccation (drying out) and by the skin\u2019s acidity. In addition,\nbeneficial microorganisms that coexist on the skin compete with invading pathogens, preventing infection. Regions of the\nbody that are not protected by skin (such as the eyes and mucus membranes) have alternative methods of defense, such as\ntears and mucus secretions that trap and rinse away pathogens, and cilia in the nasal passages and respiratory tract that push\nthe mucus with the pathogens out of the body. Throughout the body are other defenses, such as the low pH of the stomach\n(which inhibits the growth of pathogens), blood proteins that bind and disrupt bacterial cell membranes, and the process of\nurination (which flushes pathogens from the urinary tract).\nDespite these barriers, pathogens may enter the body through skin abrasions or punctures, or by collecting on mucosal\nsurfaces in large numbers that overcome the mucus or cilia. Some pathogens have evolved specific mechanisms that allow\nthem to overcome physical and chemical barriers. When pathogens do enter the body, the innate immune system responds\nwith inflammation, pathogen engulfment, and secretion of immune factors and proteins.\nPathogen Recognition\nAn infection may be intracellular or extracellular, depending on the pathogen. All viruses infect cells and replicate within\nthose cells (intracellularly), whereas bacteria and other parasites may replicate intracellularly or extracellularly, depending\non the species. The innate immune system must respond accordingly: by identifying the extracellular pathogen and/\nor by identifying host cells that have already been infected. When a pathogen enters the body, cells in the blood and\nlymph detect the specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the pathogen\u2019s surface. PAMPs are\ncarbohydrate, polypeptide, and nucleic acid \u201csignatures\u201d that are expressed by viruses, bacteria, and parasites but which\ndiffer from molecules on host cells. The immune system has specific cells, described in Figure 33.2 and shown in Figure\n33.3, with receptors that recognize these PAMPs. A macrophage is a large phagocytic cell that engulfs foreign particles\nand pathogens. Macrophages recognize PAMPs via complementary pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs are\nmolecules on macrophages and dendritic cells which are in contact with the external environment. A monocyte is a type\nof white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and differentiates into macrophages after it moves into infected\ntissue. Dendritic cells bind molecular signatures of pathogens and promote pathogen engulfment and destruction. Toll-like\nreceptors (TLRs) are a type of PRR that recognizes molecules that are shared by pathogens but distinguishable from host\nmolecules). TLRs are present in invertebrates as well as vertebrates, and appear to be one of the most ancient components\nof the immune system. TLRs have also been identified in the mammalian nervous system.\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\n1439\nFigure 33.2 The characteristics and location of cells involved in the innate immune system are described.

Note the very similar morphologies of the leukocytes (1, 2, 3). (credit: modification of work by Bruce Wetzel,\nHarry Schaefer, NCI; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nEffects of Cytokine Release\nThe binding of PRRs with PAMPs triggers the release of cytokines, which signal that a pathogen is present and needs to\nbe destroyed along with any infected cells. A cytokine is a chemical messenger that regulates cell differentiation (form and\nfunction), proliferation (production), and gene expression to affect immune responses. At least 40 types of cytokines exist\nin humans that differ in terms of the cell type that produces them, the cell type that responds to them, and the changes they\nproduce. One type cytokine, interferon, is illustrated in Figure 33.4.\nOne subclass of cytokines is the interleukin (IL), so named because they mediate interactions between leukocytes (white\nblood cells). Interleukins are involved in bridging the innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition to being released\nfrom cells after PAMP recognition, cytokines are released by the infected cells which bind to nearby uninfected cells and\ninduce those cells to release cytokines, which results in a cytokine burst.\nA second class of early-acting cytokines is interferons, which are released by infected cells as a warning to nearby\nuninfected cells. One of the functions of an interferon is to inhibit viral replication. They also have other important\nfunctions, such as tumor surveillance. Interferons work by signaling neighboring uninfected cells to destroy RNA and\nreduce protein synthesis, signaling neighboring infected cells to undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death), and activating\nimmune cells.\nIn response to interferons, uninfected cells alter their gene expression, which increases the cells\u2019 resistance to infection. One\neffect of interferon-induced gene expression is a sharply reduced cellular protein synthesis. Virally infected cells produce\nmore viruses by synthesizing large quantities of viral proteins. Thus, by reducing protein synthesis, a cell becomes resistant\nto viral infection.\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\n1441\nFigure 33.4 Interferons are cytokines that are released by a cell infected with a virus. Response of neighboring cells\nto interferon helps stem the infection.\nPhagocytosis and Inflammation\nThe first cytokines to be produced are pro-inflammatory; that is, they encourage inflammation, the localized redness,\nswelling, heat, and pain that result from the movement of leukocytes and fluid through increasingly permeable capillaries\nto a site of infection. The population of leukocytes that arrives at an infection site depends on the nature of the infecting\npathogen. Both macrophages and dendritic cells engulf pathogens and cellular debris through phagocytosis. A neutrophil\nis also a phagocytic leukocyte that engulfs and digests pathogens. Neutrophils, shown in Figure 33.3, are the most abundant\nleukocytes of the immune system. Neutrophils have a nucleus with two to five lobes, and they contain organelles, called\nlysosomes, that digest engulfed pathogens. An eosinophil is a leukocyte that works with other eosinophils to surround a\nparasite; it is involved in the allergic response and in protection against helminthes (parasitic worms).\nNeutrophils and eosinophils are particularly important leukocytes that engulf large pathogens, such as bacteria and fungi.\nA mast cell is a leukocyte that produces inflammatory molecules, such as histamine, in response to large pathogens. A\nbasophil is a leukocyte that, like a neutrophil, releases chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response as illustrated\nin Figure 33.5. Basophils are also involved in allergy and hypersensitivity responses and induce specific types of\ninflammatory responses. Eosinophils and basophils produce additional inflammatory mediators to recruit more leukocytes.\nA hypersensitive immune response to harmless antigens, such as in pollen, often involves the release of histamine by\nbasophils and mast cells.\nFigure 33.5 In response to a cut, mast cells secrete histamines that cause nearby capillaries to dilate. Neutrophils and\nmonocytes leave the capillaries. Monocytes mature into macrophages. Neutrophils, dendritic cells and macrophages\nrelease chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response. Neutrophils and macrophages also consume invading\nbacteria by phagocytosis.\n1442\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nCytokines also send feedback to cells of the nervous system to bring about the overall symptoms of feeling sick, which\ninclude lethargy, muscle pain, and nausea. These effects may have evolved because the symptoms encourage the individual\nto rest and prevent them from spreading the infection to others. Cytokines also increase the core body temperature, causing\na fever, which causes the liver to withhold iron from the blood. Without iron, certain pathogens, such as some bacteria, are\nunable to replicate; this is called nutritional immunity.\nWatch this 23-second stop-motion video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/conidia) showing a neutrophil that searches for\nand engulfs fungus spores during an elapsed time of about 79 minutes.\nHow does the action shown in the video clip (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/conidia (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/\nconidia) ) demonstrate an immune response?\na.\nNeutrophils phagocytize pathogens invading the body and release chemical histamines that cause pathogen\ndestruction and removal from the body. This prevents pathogens from producing toxic compounds that harm\ncells.\nb.\nNeutrophils phagocytize pathogens invading the body, resulting in their death and removal from the body.\nThis prevents pathogens from multiplying or producing toxic compounds that harm human cells.\nc.\nNeutrophils are phagocytic and are the first responders to infection. They produce large quantities of\ncytokines, which cause pathogen destruction and removal from the body.\nd.\nNeutrophils produce cytokines that help phagocytes to recognize foreign material that will destroy and\nremove pathogens from the body.\nNatural Killer Cells\nLymphocytes are leukocytes that are histologically identifiable by their large, darkly staining nuclei; they are small cells\nwith very little cytoplasm, as shown in Figure 33.6. Infected cells are identified and destroyed by natural killer (NK) cells,\nlymphocytes that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells (abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade\nother tissue). T cells and B cells of the adaptive immune system also are classified as lymphocytes. T cells are lymphocytes\nthat mature in the thymus gland, and B cells are lymphocytes that mature in the bone marrow. NK cells identify intracellular\ninfections, especially from viruses, by the altered expression of major histocompatibility class (MHC) I molecules on\nthe surface of infected cells. MHC I molecules are proteins on the surfaces of all nucleated cells, thus they are scarce on\nred blood cells and platelets which are non-nucleated. The function of MHC I molecules is to display fragments of proteins\nfrom the infectious agents within the cell to T-cells; healthy cells will be ignored, while \u201cnon-self\u201d or foreign proteins will\nbe attacked by the immune system. MHC II molecules are found mainly on cells containing antigens (\u201cnon-self proteins\u201d)\nand on lymphocytes. MHC II molecules interact with helper T-cells to trigger the appropriate immune response, which\nmay include the inflammatory response.\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\n1443\nFigure 33.6 Lymphocytes, such as NK cells, are characterized by their large nuclei that actively absorb Wright stain\nand therefore appear dark colored under a microscope.\nAn infected cell (or a tumor cell) is usually incapable of synthesizing and displaying MHC I molecules appropriately.\nThe metabolic resources of cells infected by some viruses produce proteins that interfere with MHC I processing and/\nor trafficking to the cell surface. The reduced MHC I on host cells varies from virus to virus and results from active\ninhibitors being produced by the viruses. This process can deplete host MHC I molecules on the cell surface, which NK\ncells detect as \u201cunhealthy\u201d or \u201cabnormal\u201d while searching for cellular MHC I molecules. Similarly, the dramatically altered\ngene expression of tumor cells leads to expression of extremely deformed or absent MHC I molecules that also signal\n\u201cunhealthy\u201d or \u201cabnormal.\u201d\nNK cells are always active; an interaction with normal, intact MHC I molecules on a healthy cell disables the killing\nsequence, and the NK cell moves on. After the NK cell detects an infected or tumor cell, its cytoplasm secretes granules\ncomprised of perforin, a destructive protein that creates a pore in the target cell. Granzymes are released along with the\nperforin in the immunological synapse. A granzyme is a protease that digests cellular proteins and induces the target cell to\nundergo programmed cell death, or apoptosis. Phagocytic cells then digest the cell debris left behind. NK cells are constantly\npatrolling the body and are an effective mechanism for controlling potential infections and preventing cancer progression.\nComplement\nAn array of approximately 20 types of soluble proteins, called a complement system, functions to destroy extracellular\npathogens. Cells of the liver and macrophages synthesize complement proteins continuously; these proteins are abundant\nin the blood serum and are capable of responding immediately to infecting microorganisms. The complement system is so\nnamed because it is complementary to the antibody response of the adaptive immune system. Complement proteins bind\nto the surfaces of microorganisms and are particularly attracted to pathogens that are already bound by antibodies. Binding\nof complement proteins occurs in a specific and highly regulated sequence, with each successive protein being activated\nby cleavage and/or structural changes induced upon binding of the preceding protein(s). After the first few complement\nproteins bind, a cascade of sequential binding events follows in which the pathogen rapidly becomes coated in complement\nproteins.\nComplement proteins perform several functions. The proteins serve as a marker to indicate the presence of a pathogen to\nphagocytic cells, such as macrophages and B cells, and enhance engulfment; this process is called opsonization. Certain\ncomplement proteins can combine to form attack complexes that open pores in microbial cell membranes. These structures\ndestroy pathogens by causing their contents to leak, as illustrated in Figure 33.7.\n1444\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 33.7 The classic pathway for the complement cascade involves the attachment of several initial complement\nproteins to an antibody-bound pathogen followed by rapid activation and binding of many more complement proteins\nand the creation of destructive pores in the microbial cell envelope and cell wall. The alternate pathway does not\ninvolve antibody activation. Rather, C3 convertase spontaneously breaks down C3. Endogenous regulatory proteins\nprevent the complement complex from binding to host cells. Pathogens lacking these regulatory proteins are lysed.\n(credit: modification of work by NIH)\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\n1445\n33.2 | Adaptive Immune Response\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat is adaptive immunity?\n\u2022\nWhat is the difference between adaptive and innate immunity?\n\u2022\nWhat are the cell-mediated immune response and the humoral immune response?\n\u2022\nWhat is immune tolerance?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nAdaptive immune response takes days or even weeks to become established\u2014much longer than the innate response\u2014and\nis more specific to pathogens and involves molecular memory. This type of immunity occurs after we\u2019ve been exposed to\nan antigen either from a pathogen or through vaccination and is activated when the innate immune response is insufficient\nto control the infection.

        "summary": "The innate immune response is the body\u2019s first line of defense, providing a rapid, nonspecific reaction to pathogens through physical and chemical barriers such as skin, mucus, tears, stomach acid, and beneficial microbes. When pathogens bypass these barriers, immune cells like macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, and basophils identify them via pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including toll-like receptors (TLRs). This recognition triggers the release of cytokines, including interleukins and interferons, which promote inflammation, recruit immune cells, inhibit pathogen replication, and induce fever to hinder microbial growth. Phagocytosis by macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils removes pathogens, while natural killer (NK) cells target and destroy virus-infected or tumor cells with reduced or altered MHC I molecules by releasing perforin and granzymes to induce apoptosis. The complement system, a group of liver- and macrophage-produced proteins, enhances phagocytosis, marks pathogens for destruction, and can directly lyse microbial cells by forming membrane attack complexes. Together, these mechanisms act quickly to control infections and support the more specialized adaptive immune response."

T cells are a key component in the cell-mediated response\u2014the specific immune response that utilizes T cells to\nneutralize cells that have been infected with viruses and certain bacteria. There are three types of T cells: cytotoxic, helper,\nand suppressor T cells. Cytotoxic T cells destroy virus-infected cells in the cell-mediated immune response, and helper T\ncells play a part in activating both the antibody and the cell-mediated immune responses. Suppressor T cells deactivate T\ncells and B cells when needed, and thus prevent the immune response from becoming too intense.\nAn antigen is a foreign or \u201cnon-self\u201d macromolecule that reacts with cells of the immune system. Not all antigens will\nprovoke a response. For instance, individuals produce innumerable \u201cself\u201d antigens and are constantly exposed to harmless\nforeign antigens, such as food proteins, pollen, or dust components. The suppression of immune responses to harmless\nmacromolecules is highly regulated and typically prevents processes that could be damaging to the host, known as tolerance.\nThe innate immune system contains cells that detect potentially harmful antigens, and then inform the adaptive immune\nresponse about the presence of these antigens. An antigen-presenting cell (APC) is an immune cell that detects, engulfs,\nand informs the adaptive immune response about an infection. When a pathogen is detected, these APCs will phagocytose\nthe pathogen and digest it to form many different fragments of the antigen. Antigen fragments will then be transported to\nthe surface of the APC, where they will serve as an indicator to other immune cells. Dendritic cells are immune cells that\nprocess antigen material; they are present in the skin (Langerhans cells) and the lining of the nose, lungs, stomach, and\nintestines. Sometimes a dendritic cell presents on the surface of other cells to induce an immune response, thus functioning\nas an antigen-presenting cell. Macrophages also function as APCs. Before activation and differentiation, B cells can also\nfunction as APCs.\nAfter phagocytosis by APCs, the phagocytic vesicle fuses with an intracellular lysosome forming phagolysosome. Within\nthe phagolysosome, the components are broken down into fragments; the fragments are then loaded onto MHC class I or\nMHC class II molecules and are transported to the cell surface for antigen presentation, as illustrated in Figure 33.8. Note\nthat T lymphocytes cannot properly respond to the antigen unless it is processed and embedded in an MHC II molecule.\nAPCs express MHC on their surfaces, and when combined with a foreign antigen, these complexes signal a \u201cnon-self\u201d\ninvader. Once the fragment of antigen is embedded in the MHC II molecule, the immune cell can respond. Helper T- cells\nare one of the main lymphocytes that respond to antigen-presenting cells. Recall that all other nucleated cells of the body\nexpressed MHC I molecules, which signal \u201chealthy\u201d or \u201cnormal.\u201d\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\n1447\nFigure 33.8 An APC, such as a macrophage, engulfs and digests a foreign bacterium. An antigen from the bacterium\nis presented on the cell surface in conjunction with an MHC II molecule Lymphocytes of the adaptive immune response\ninteract with antigen-embedded MHC II molecules to mature into functional immune cells.\nThis animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/immune_system) from Rockefeller University shows how dendritic cells\nact as sentinels in the body's immune system.\nWhat key role do dendritic cells play in the human immune response?\na.\nDendritic cells directly kill infected cells and emit cytokines, which amplify the immune response.\nb.\nDendritic cells recognize foreign proteins and prepare them to be displayed to immune cells in the lymph.\nThis activates an immune response.\nc.\nDendritic cells identify tumor cells or cells infected with viruses and destroy them.\nd.\nDendritic cells act as phagocytes. They engulf and digest pathogens.\nT and B Lymphocytes\nLymphocytes in human circulating blood are approximately 80 to 90 percent T cells, shown in Figure 33.9, and 10 to 20\npercent B cells. Recall that the T cells are involved in the cell-mediated immune response, whereas B cells are part of the\nhumoral immune response.\nT cells encompass a heterogeneous population of cells with extremely diverse functions. Some T cells respond to APCs of\nthe innate immune system, and indirectly induce immune responses by releasing cytokines. Other T cells stimulate B cells\nto prepare their own response. Another population of T cells detects APC signals and directly kills the infected cells. Other\nT cells are involved in suppressing inappropriate immune reactions to harmless or \u201cself\u201d antigens.\n1448\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 33.9 This scanning electron micrograph shows a T lymphocyte, which is responsible for the cell-mediated\nimmune response. T cells are able to recognize antigens. (credit: modification of work by NCI; scale-bar data from Matt\nRussell)\nT and B cells exhibit a common theme of recognition/binding of specific antigens via a complementary receptor, followed\nby activation and self-amplification/maturation to specifically bind to the particular antigen of the infecting pathogen. T\nand B lymphocytes are also similar in that each cell only expresses one type of antigen receptor. Any individual may\npossess a population of T and B cells that together express a near limitless variety of antigen receptors that are capable of\nrecognizing virtually any infecting pathogen. T and B cells are activated when they recognize small components of antigens,\ncalled epitopes, presented by APCs, illustrated in Figure 33.10. Note that recognition occurs at a specific epitope rather\nthan on the entire antigen; for this reason, epitopes are known as \u201cantigenic determinants.\u201d In the absence of information\nfrom APCs, T and B cells remain inactive, or na\u00efve, and are unable to prepare an immune response. The requirement for\ninformation from the APCs of innate immunity to trigger B cell or T cell activation illustrates the essential nature of the\ninnate immune response to the functioning of the entire immune system.\nFigure 33.10 An antigen is a macromolecule that reacts with components of the immune system. A given antigen may\ncontain several motifs that are recognized by immune cells. Each motif is an epitope. In this figure, the entire structure\nis an antigen, and the orange, salmon and green components projecting from it represent potential epitopes.\nNa\u00efve T cells can express one of two different molecules, CD4 or CD8, on their surface, as shown in Figure 33.11, and\nare accordingly classified as CD4+ or CD8+ cells. These molecules are important because they regulate how a T cell will\ninteract with and respond to an APC. Na\u00efve CD4+ cells bind APCs via their antigen-embedded MHC II molecules and\nare stimulated to become helper T (TH) lymphocytes, cells that go on to stimulate B cells (or cytotoxic T cells) directly\nor secrete cytokines to inform more and various target cells about the pathogenic threat. In contrast, CD8+ cells engage\nantigen-embedded MHC I molecules on APCs and are stimulated to become cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which\ndirectly kill infected cells by apoptosis and emit cytokines to amplify the immune response. The two populations of T cells\nhave different mechanisms of immune protection, but both bind MHC molecules via their antigen receptors called T cell\nreceptors (TCRs). The CD4 or CD8 surface molecules differentiate whether the TCR will engage an MHC II or an MHC I\nmolecule. Because they assist in binding specificity, the CD4 and CD8 molecules are described as coreceptors.\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\n1449\nFigure 33.11 Na\u00efve CD4+ T cells engage MHC II molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and become\nactivated. Clones of the activated helper T cell, in turn, activate B cells and CD8+ T cells, which become cytotoxic\nT cells. Cytotoxic T cells kill infected cells.\nWhich of the following statements about T cells is false?\na.\nThe T cell receptor is found on both CD4+ and CD8+T cells.\nb.\nHelper T cells are CD4+, while cytotoxic T cells are CD8+.\nc.\nHelper T cells release cytokines, while cytotoxic T cells kill the infected cell.\nd.\nMHC II is a receptor found on most body cells, while MHC I is a receptor found only on immune cells.\nConsider the innumerable possible antigens that an individual will be exposed to during a lifetime. The mammalian adaptive\nimmune system is adept in responding appropriately to each antigen. Mammals have an enormous diversity of T cell\npopulations, resulting from the diversity of TCRs. Each TCR consists of two polypeptide chains that span the T cell\nmembrane, as illustrated in Figure 33.12; the chains are linked by a disulfide bridge. Each polypeptide chain is comprised of\na constant domain and a variable domain: a domain, in this sense, is a specific region of a protein that may be regulatory or\nstructural. The intracellular domain is involved in intracellular signaling. A single T cell will express thousands of identical\ncopies of one specific TCR variant on its cell surface. The specificity of the adaptive immune system occurs because it\nsynthesizes millions of different T cell populations, each expressing a TCR that differs in its variable domain. This TCR\n1450\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\ndiversity is achieved by the mutation and recombination of genes that encode these receptors in stem cell precursors of\nT cells. The binding between an antigen-displaying MHC molecule and a complementary TCR \u201cmatch\u201d indicates that the\nadaptive immune system needs to activate and produce that specific T cell because its structure is appropriate to recognize\nand destroy the invading pathogen.\nFigure 33.12 A T cell receptor spans the membrane and projects variable binding regions into the extracellular space\nto bind processed antigens via MHC molecules on APCs.\nHelper T Lymphocytes\nThe TH lymphocytes function indirectly to identify potential pathogens for other cells of the immune system. These cells\nare important for extracellular infections, such as those caused by certain bacteria, helminths, and protozoa. TH lymphocytes\nrecognize specific antigens displayed in the MHC II complexes of APCs. There are two major populations of TH cells:\nTH1 and TH2. TH1 cells secrete cytokines to enhance the activities of macrophages and other T cells. TH1 cells activate the\naction of cyotoxic T cells, as well as macrophages. TH2 cells stimulate na\u00efve B cells to destroy foreign invaders via antibody\nsecretion. Whether a TH1 or a TH2 immune response develops depends on the specific types of cytokines secreted by cells\nof the innate immune system, which in turn depends on the nature of the invading pathogen.\nThe TH1-mediated response involves macrophages and is associated with inflammation. Recall the frontline defenses of\nmacrophages involved in the innate immune response. Some intracellular bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis,\nhave evolved to multiply in macrophages after they have been engulfed. These pathogens evade attempts by macrophages to\ndestroy and digest the pathogen. When M. tuberculosis infection occurs, macrophages can stimulate na\u00efve T cells to become\nTH1 cells. These stimulated T cells secrete specific cytokines that send feedback to the macrophage to stimulate its digestive\ncapabilities and allow it to destroy the colonizing M. tuberculosis. In the same manner, TH1-activated macrophages also\nbecome better suited to ingest and kill tumor cells. In summary; TH1 responses are directed toward intracellular invaders\nwhile TH2 responses are aimed at those that are extracellular.\nB Lymphocytes\nWhen stimulated by the TH2 pathway, na\u00efve B cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. A plasma cell\nis an immune cell that secrets antibodies; these cells arise from B cells that were stimulated by antigens. Similar to T\ncells, na\u00efve B cells initially are coated in thousands of B cell receptors (BCRs), which are membrane-bound forms of Ig\n(immunoglobulin, or an antibody). The B cell receptor has two heavy chains and two light chains connected by disulfide\nlinkages. Each chain has a constant and a variable region; the latter is involved in antigen binding. Two other membrane\nproteins, Ig alpha and Ig beta, are involved in signaling. The receptors of any particular B cell, as shown in Figure 33.13\nare all the same, but the hundreds of millions of different B cells in an individual have distinct recognition domains that\ncontribute to extensive diversity in the types of molecular structures to which they can bind. In this state, B cells function\nas APCs. They bind and engulf foreign antigens via their BCRs and then display processed antigens in the context of MHC\nII molecules to TH2 cells. When a TH2 cell detects that a B cell is bound to a relevant antigen, it secretes specific cytokines\nthat induce the B cell to proliferate rapidly, which makes thousands of identical (clonal) copies of it, and then it synthesizes\nand secretes antibodies with the same antigen recognition pattern as the BCRs. The activation of B cells corresponding\nto one specific BCR variant and the dramatic proliferation of that variant is known as clonal selection. This phenomenon\ndrastically, but briefly, changes the proportions of BCR variants expressed by the immune system, and shifts the balance\ntoward BCRs specific to the infecting pathogen.\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\n1451\nFigure 33.13 B cell receptors are embedded in the membranes of B cells and bind a variety of antigens through their\nvariable regions. The signal transduction region transfers the signal into the cell.\nT and B cells differ in one fundamental way: whereas T cells bind antigens that have been digested and embedded in MHC\nmolecules by APCs, B cells function as APCs that bind intact antigens that have not been processed. Although T and B\ncells both react with molecules that are termed \u201cantigens,\u201d these lymphocytes actually respond to very different types of\nmolecules. B cells must be able to bind intact antigens because they secrete antibodies that must recognize the pathogen\ndirectly, rather than digested remnants of the pathogen. Bacterial carbohydrate and lipid molecules can activate B cells\nindependently from the T cells.\nCytotoxic T Lymphocytes\nCTLs, a subclass of T cells, function to clear infections directly. The cell-mediated part of the adaptive immune system\nconsists of CTLs that attack and destroy infected cells. CTLs are particularly important in protecting against viral\ninfections; this is because viruses replicate within cells where they are shielded from extracellular contact with circulating\nantibodies. When APCs phagocytize pathogens and present MHC I-embedded antigens to na\u00efve CD8+ T cells that express\ncomplementary TCRs, the CD8+ T cells become activated to proliferate according to clonal selection. These resulting CTLs\nthen identify non-APCs displaying the same MHC I-embedded antigens (for example, viral proteins)\u2014for example, the\nCTLs identify infected host cells.\nIntracellularly, infected cells typically die after the infecting pathogen replicates to a sufficient concentration and lyses the\ncell, as many viruses do. CTLs attempt to identify and destroy infected cells before the pathogen can replicate and escape,\nthereby halting the progression of intracellular infections. CTLs also support NK lymphocytes to destroy early cancers.\nCytokines secreted by the TH1 response that stimulates macrophages also stimulate CTLs and enhance their ability to\nidentify and destroy infected cells and tumors.\nCTLs sense MHC I-embedded antigens by directly interacting with infected cells via their TCRs. Binding of TCRs with\nantigens activates CTLs to release perforin and granzyme, degradative enzymes that will induce apoptosis of the infected\ncell. Recall that this is a similar destruction mechanism to that used by NK cells. In this process, the CTL does not become\ninfected and is not harmed by the secretion of perforin and granzymes. In fact, the functions of NK cells and CTLs are\ncomplementary and maximize the removal of infected cells, as illustrated in Figure 33.14. If the NK cell cannot identify\nthe \u201cmissing self\u201d pattern of down-regulated MHC I molecules, then the CTL can identify it by the complex of MHC I\nwith foreign antigens, which signals \u201caltered self.\u201d Similarly, if the CTL cannot detect antigen-embedded MHC I because\nthe receptors are depleted from the cell surface, NK cells will destroy the cell instead. CTLs also emit cytokines, such as\ninterferons, that alter surface protein expression in other infected cells, such that the infected cells can be easily identified\nand destroyed. Moreover, these interferons can also prevent virally infected cells from releasing virus particles.\n1452\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 33.14 Natural killer (NK) cells recognize the MHC I receptor on healthy cells. If MHC I is absent, the cell is\nlysed.\nBased on what you know about MHC receptors, why do you think an organ transplanted from an incompatible donor\nto a recipient will be rejected?\na.\nThe natural killer cells of the recipient will recognize the MHC II proteins present on the cell surface of\nincompatible organ as foreign and activate macrophages, which will phagocytose foreign cells. The attack\nwill cause the organ to be rejected.\nb.\nNeutrophils will recognize the proteins on incompatible organ as foreign and will phagocytose the foreign\ncells of the incompatible organ.\nc.\nThe natural killer cells of the recipient will recognize the MHC II proteins present on the cell surface of\nincompatible organ as foreign and will attack these foreign proteins. The attack will cause the organ to be\nrejected.\nd.\nThe recipient\u2019s immune system will recognize the proteins on the incompatible organ as foreign and will\nattack these foreign proteins. The attack will cause the organ to be rejected.\nPlasma cells and CTLs are collectively called effector cells: they represent differentiated versions of their na\u00efve\ncounterparts, and they are involved in bringing about the immune defense of killing pathogens and infected host cells.\nMucosal Surfaces and Immune Tolerance\nThe innate and adaptive immune responses discussed thus far comprise the systemic immune system (affecting the\nwhole body), which is distinct from the mucosal immune system. Mucosal immunity is formed by mucosa-associated\nlymphoid tissue, which functions independently of the systemic immune system, and which has its own innate and adaptive\ncomponents. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), illustrated in Figure 33.15, is a collection of lymphatic tissue\nthat combines with epithelial tissue lining the mucosa throughout the body. This tissue functions as the immune barrier and\nresponse in areas of the body with direct contact to the external environment. The systemic and mucosal immune systems\nuse many of the same cell types. Foreign particles that make their way to MALT are taken up by absorptive epithelial cells\ncalled M cells and delivered to APCs located directly below the mucosal tissue. M cells function in the transport described,\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\n1453\nand are located in the Peyer\u2019s patch, a lymphoid nodule. APCs of the mucosal immune system are primarily dendritic cells,\nwith B cells and macrophages having minor roles. Processed antigens displayed on APCs are detected by T cells in the\nMALT and at various mucosal induction sites, such as the tonsils, adenoids, appendix, or the mesenteric lymph nodes of the\nintestine. Activated T cells then migrate through the lymphatic system and into the circulatory system to mucosal sites of\ninfection.\nFigure 33.15 The topology and function of intestinal MALT is shown. Pathogens are taken up by M cells in the intestinal\nepithelium and excreted into a pocket formed by the inner surface of the cell. The pocket contains antigen-presenting\ncells such as dendritic cells, which engulf the antigens, then present them with MHC II molecules on the cell surface.\nThe dendritic cells migrate to an underlying tissue called a Peyer\u2019s patch. Antigen-presenting cells, T cells, and B cells\naggregate within the Peyer\u2019s patch, forming organized lymphoid follicles. There, some T cells and B cells are activated.\nOther antigen-loaded dendritic cells migrate through the lymphatic system where they activate B cells, T cells, and\nplasma cells in the lymph nodes. The activated cells then return to MALT tissue effector sites. IgA and other antibodies\nare secreted into the intestinal lumen.\nMALT is a crucial component of a functional immune system because mucosal surfaces, such as the nasal passages, are the\nfirst tissues onto which inhaled or ingested pathogens are deposited. The mucosal tissue includes the mouth, pharynx, and\nesophagus, and the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts.\nThe immune system has to be regulated to prevent wasteful, unnecessary responses to harmless substances, and more\nimportantly so that it does not attack \u201cself.\u201d The acquired ability to prevent an unnecessary or harmful immune response\nto a detected foreign substance known not to cause disease is described as immune tolerance. Immune tolerance is crucial\nfor maintaining mucosal homeostasis given the tremendous number of foreign substances (such as food proteins) that APCs\nof the oral cavity, pharynx, and gastrointestinal mucosa encounter. Immune tolerance is brought about by specialized APCs\nin the liver, lymph nodes, small intestine, and lung that present harmless antigens to an exceptionally diverse population of\nregulatory T (Treg) cells, specialized lymphocytes that suppress local inflammation and inhibit the secretion of stimulatory\nimmune factors. The combined result of Treg cells is to prevent immunologic activation and inflammation in undesired tissue\n1454\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\ncompartments and to allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead. In addition to promoting immune tolerance\nof harmless antigens, other subsets of Treg cells are involved in the prevention of the autoimmune response, which is an\ninappropriate immune response to host cells or self-antigens. Another Treg class suppresses immune responses to harmful\npathogens after the infection has cleared to minimize host cell damage induced by inflammation and cell lysis.\nImmunological Memory\nThe adaptive immune system possesses a memory component that allows for an efficient and dramatic response upon\nreinvasion of the same pathogen. Memory is handled by the adaptive immune system with little reliance on cues from the\ninnate response. During the adaptive immune response to a pathogen that has not been encountered before, called a primary\nresponse, plasma cells secreting antibodies and differentiated T cells increase, then plateau over time. As B and T cells\nmature into effector cells, a subset of the na\u00efve populations differentiates into B and T memory cells with the same antigen\nspecificities, as illustrated in Figure 33.16.\nA memory cell is an antigen-specific B or T lymphocyte that does not differentiate into effector cells during the primary\nimmune response, but that can immediately become effector cells upon re-exposure to the same pathogen. During the\nprimary immune response, memory cells do not respond to antigens and do not contribute to host defenses. As the infection\nis cleared and pathogenic stimuli subside, the effectors are no longer needed, and they undergo apoptosis. In contrast, the\nmemory cells persist in the circulation.\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\n1455\nFigure 33.16 After initially binding an antigen to the B cell receptor (BCR), a B cell internalizes the antigen and\npresents it on MHC II. A helper T cell recognizes the MHC II\u2013antigen complex and activates the B cell. As a result,\nmemory B cells and plasma cells are made.\nWhy are both plasma B cells and memory B cells made when helper T cells activate B cells?\na.\nPlasma B cells produce antibodies to fight against pathogen. Memory B cells retain the information about\nthis particular pathogen so that during the subsequent exposure to the same pathogen, a stronger response\ncan be generated.\nb.\nPlasma B cells phagocytose the pathogen. Memory B cells retain the information about this particular\npathogen so that during the subsequent exposure to the same pathogen, a stronger response can be generated.\nc.\nPlasma B cells produce antibodies to fight against a pathogen. Memory B cells retain the information about\nthis particular pathogen so that during the subsequent exposure to the same pathogen, a stronger response\ncan be generated, but antibodies are not produced.\nd.\nPlasma B cells produces some cytokines that allows memory B cells to recognize the pathogen and produce\nantibodies to fight against the pathogen.\nIf the pathogen is never encountered again during the individual\u2019s lifetime, B and T memory cells will circulate for a few\nyears or even several decades and will gradually die off, having never functioned as effector cells. However, if the host is\nre-exposed to the same pathogen type, circulating memory cells will immediately differentiate into plasma cells and CTLs\nwithout input from APCs or TH cells. One reason the adaptive immune response is delayed is because it takes time for na\u00efve\n1456\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nB and T cells with the appropriate antigen specificities to be identified and activated. Upon reinfection, this step is skipped,\nand the result is a more rapid production of immune defenses. Memory B cells that differentiate into plasma cells output tens\nto hundreds-fold greater antibody amounts than were secreted during the primary response, as the graph in Figure 33.17\nillustrates. This rapid and dramatic antibody response may stop the infection before it can even become established, and the\nindividual may not realize they had been exposed.\nFigure 33.17 In the primary response to infection, antibodies are secreted first from plasma cells. Upon re-exposure\nto the same pathogen, memory cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells that output a greater amount of\nantibody for a longer period of time.\nVaccination is based on the knowledge that exposure to noninfectious antigens, derived from known pathogens, generates\na mild primary immune response. The immune response to vaccination may not be perceived by the host as illness but still\nconfers immune memory. When exposed to the corresponding pathogen to which an individual was vaccinated, the reaction\nis similar to a secondary exposure. Because each reinfection generates more memory cells and increased resistance to the\npathogen, and because some memory cells die, certain vaccine courses involve one or more booster vaccinations to mimic\nrepeat exposures: for instance, tetanus boosters are necessary every ten years because the memory cells only live that long.\nMucosal Immune Memory\nA subset of T and B cells of the mucosal immune system differentiates into memory cells just as in the systemic immune\nsystem. Upon reinvasion of the same pathogen type, a pronounced immune response occurs at the mucosal site where the\noriginal pathogen deposited, but a collective defense is also organized within interconnected or adjacent mucosal tissue. For\ninstance, the immune memory of an infection in the oral cavity would also elicit a response in the pharynx if the oral cavity\nwas exposed to the same pathogen.\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\n1457\nVaccinologist\nVaccination (or immunization) involves the delivery, usually by injection as shown in Figure 33.18, of\nnoninfectious antigen(s) derived from known pathogens. Other components, called adjuvants, are delivered\nin parallel to help stimulate the immune response. Immunological memory is the reason vaccines work.\nIdeally, the effect of vaccination is to elicit immunological memory, and thus resistance to specific pathogens\nwithout the individual having to experience an infection.\nFigure 33.18 Vaccines are often delivered by injection into the arm. (credit: U.S. Navy Photographer's Mate\nAirman Apprentice Christopher D. Blachly)\nVaccinologists are involved in the process of vaccine development from the initial idea to the availability\nof the completed vaccine. This process can take decades, can cost millions of dollars, and can involve\nmany obstacles along the way. For instance, injected vaccines stimulate the systemic immune system,\neliciting humoral and cell-mediated immunity, but have little effect on the mucosal response, which presents\na challenge because many pathogens are deposited and replicate in mucosal compartments, and the\ninjection does not provide the most efficient immune memory for these disease agents. For this reason,\nvaccinologists are actively involved in developing new vaccines that are applied via intranasal, aerosol,\noral, or transcutaneous (absorbed through the skin) delivery methods. Importantly, mucosal-administered\nvaccines elicit both mucosal and systemic immunity and produce the same level of disease resistance as\ninjected vaccines.\n1458\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 33.19 The polio vaccine can be administered orally. (credit: modification of work by UNICEF Sverige)\nCurrently, a version of intranasal influenza vaccine is available, and the polio and typhoid vaccines can\nbe administered orally, as shown in Figure 33.19. Similarly, the measles and rubella vaccines are being\nadapted to aerosol delivery using inhalation devices. Eventually, transgenic plants may be engineered to\nproduce vaccine antigens that can be eaten to confer disease resistance. Other vaccines may be adapted\nto rectal or vaginal application to elicit immune responses in rectal, genitourinary, or reproductive mucosa.\nFinally, vaccine antigens may be adapted to transdermal application in which the skin is lightly scraped\nand microneedles are used to pierce the outermost layer. In addition to mobilizing the mucosal immune\nresponse, this new generation of vaccines may end the anxiety associated with injections and, in turn,\nimprove patient participation.\nActivity\nConstruct a diagram to illustrate how T cells and B cells differ from each other with respect to the antigens\nthat they bind.\nThink About It\nWhy is it advantageous to be able to mount a faster immune response upon re-exposure to the same pathogen? How\ndoes the immune system accomplish this response?\nPrimary Centers of the Immune System\nAlthough the immune system is characterized by circulating cells throughout the body, the regulation, maturation, and\nintercommunication of immune factors occur at specific sites. The blood circulates immune cells, proteins, and other factors\nthrough the body. Approximately 0.1 percent of all cells in the blood are leukocytes, which encompass monocytes (the\nprecursor of macrophages) and lymphocytes. The majority of cells in the blood are erythrocytes (red blood cells). Lymph is\na watery fluid that bathes tissues and organs with protective white blood cells and does not contain erythrocytes. Cells of the\nimmune system can travel between the distinct lymphatic and blood circulatory systems, which are separated by interstitial\nspace, by a process called extravasation (passing through to surrounding tissue).\nThe cells of the immune system originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. Cytokines stimulate these\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\n1459\nstem cells to differentiate into immune cells. B cell maturation occurs in the bone marrow, whereas na\u00efve T cells transit\nfrom the bone marrow to the thymus for maturation. In the thymus, immature T cells that express TCRs complementary to\nself-antigens are destroyed. This process helps prevent autoimmune responses.\nOn maturation, T and B lymphocytes circulate to various destinations. Lymph nodes scattered throughout the body, as\nillustrated in Figure 33.20, house large populations of T and B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. Lymph gathers\nantigens as it drains from tissues. These antigens then are filtered through lymph nodes before the lymph is returned\nto circulation. APCs in the lymph nodes capture and process antigens and inform nearby lymphocytes about potential\npathogens.\nFigure 33.20 (a) Lymphatic vessels carry a clear fluid called lymph throughout the body. The liquid enters (b) lymph\nnodes through afferent vessels. Lymph nodes are filled with lymphocytes that purge infecting cells. The lymph then\nexits through efferent vessels. (credit: modification of work by NIH, NCI)\nThe spleen houses B and T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and NK cells. The spleen, shown in Figure 33.21, is the site\nwhere APCs that have trapped foreign particles in the blood can communicate with lymphocytes. Antibodies are synthesized\nand secreted by activated plasma cells in the spleen, and the spleen filters foreign substances and antibody-complexed\npathogens from the blood. Functionally, the spleen is to the blood as lymph nodes are to the lymph.\n1460\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 33.21 The spleen is similar to a lymph node but is much larger and filters blood instead of lymph.

        "summary": "The adaptive immune response is a highly specific defense mechanism that develops over days or weeks after exposure to an antigen from a pathogen or vaccine, and it provides long-term protection through immunological memory. It consists of two main branches: the cell-mediated response, driven by T lymphocytes, and the humoral response, mediated by B lymphocytes and their antibodies. Antigen-presenting cells (such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and sometimes B cells) process and present antigens via MHC molecules to activate T cells, which differentiate into helper T cells (TH1 for intracellular threats, TH2 for extracellular threats), cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that destroy infected cells, or regulatory T cells that maintain immune tolerance. B cells, when activated (often by TH2 cells), undergo clonal selection, proliferate, and differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibodies or into memory B cells. The adaptive system also includes mucosal immunity through mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and mechanisms of immune tolerance to prevent harmful or autoimmune responses. Immunological memory allows for a faster, stronger reaction upon re-exposure without the need for full activation steps, forming the principle behind vaccination, which can be designed for systemic or mucosal immunity. Lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, and thymus are central to the activation, maturation, and coordination of adaptive immune cells."

Bonds between the cysteine amino acids in the antibody molecule attach the polypeptides to each other. The\nareas where the antigen is recognized on the antibody are variable domains and the antibody base is composed of constant\ndomains.\nIn germ-line B cells, the variable region of the light chain gene has 40 variable (V) and five joining (J) segments. An enzyme\ncalled DNA recombinase randomly excises most of these segments out of the gene, and splices one V segment to one J\nsegment. During RNA processing, all but one V and J segment are spliced out. Recombination and splicing may result in\nover 106 possible VJ combinations. As a result, each differentiated B cell in the human body typically has a unique variable\nchain. The constant domain, which does not bind antibody, is the same for all antibodies.\n1462\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 33.22 (a) As a germ-line B cell matures, an enzyme called DNA recombinase randomly excises V and J\nsegments from the light chain gene. Splicing at the mRNA level results in further gene rearrangement. As a result, (b)\neach antibody has a unique variable region capable of binding a different antigen.\nSimilar to TCRs and BCRs, antibody diversity is produced by the mutation and recombination of approximately 300\ndifferent gene segments encoding the light and heavy chain variable domains in precursor cells that are destined to become\nB cells. The variable domains from the heavy and light chains interact to form the binding site through which an antibody\ncan bind a specific epitope on an antigen. The numbers of repeated constant domains in Ig classes are the same for all\nantibodies corresponding to a specific class. Antibodies are structurally similar to the extracellular component of the BCRs,\nand B cell maturation to plasma cells can be visualized in simple terms as the cell acquires the ability to secrete the\nextracellular portion of its BCR in large quantities.\nAntibody Classes\nAntibodies can be divided into five classes\u2014IgM, IgG, IgA, IgD, IgE\u2014based on their physiochemical, structural, and\nimmunological properties. IgGs, which make up about 80 percent of all antibodies, have heavy chains that consist of one\nvariable domain and three identical constant domains. IgA and IgD also have three constant domains per heavy chain,\nwhereas IgM and IgE each have four constant domains per heavy chain. The variable domain determines binding specificity\nand the constant domain of the heavy chain determines the immunological mechanism of action of the corresponding\nantibody class. It is possible for two antibodies to have the same binding specificities but be in different classes and,\ntherefore, to be involved in different functions.\nAfter an adaptive defense is produced against a pathogen, typically plasma cells first secrete IgM into the blood. BCRs on\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\n1463\nna\u00efve B cells are of the IgM class and occasionally IgD class. IgM molecules make up approximately ten percent of all\nantibodies. Prior to antibody secretion, plasma cells assemble IgM molecules into pentamers (five individual antibodies)\nlinked by a joining (J) chain, as shown in Figure 33.23. The pentamer arrangement means that these macromolecules can\nbind ten identical antigens. However, IgM molecules released early in the adaptive immune response do not bind to antigens\nas stably as IgGs, which are one of the possible types of antibodies secreted in large quantities upon re-exposure to the same\npathogen. Figure 33.23 summarizes the properties of immunoglobulins and illustrates their basic structures.\nFigure 33.23 Immunoglobulins have different functions, but all are composed of light and heavy chains that form a\nY-shaped structure.\nIgAs populate the saliva, tears, breast milk, and mucus secretions of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary\ntracts. Collectively, these bodily fluids coat and protect the extensive mucosa (4000 square feet in humans). The total\nnumber of IgA molecules in these bodily secretions is greater than the number of IgG molecules in the blood serum. A small\namount of IgA is also secreted into the serum in monomeric form. Conversely, some IgM is secreted into bodily fluids of\nthe mucosa. Similar to IgM, IgA molecules are secreted as polymeric structures linked with a J chain. However, IgAs are\nsecreted mostly as dimeric molecules, not pentamers.\nIgE is present in the serum in small quantities and is best characterized in its role as an allergy mediator. IgD is also present\nin small quantities. Similar to IgM, BCRs of the IgD class are found on the surface of na\u00efve B cells. This class supports\nantigen recognition and maturation of B cells to plasma cells.\nAntibody Functions\nDifferentiated plasma cells are crucial players in the humoral response, and the antibodies they secrete are particularly\nsignificant against extracellular pathogens and toxins. Antibodies circulate freely and act independently of plasma cells.\nAntibodies can be transferred from one individual to another to temporarily protect against infectious disease. For instance,\na person who has recently produced a successful immune response against a particular disease agent can donate blood to\na nonimmune recipient and confer temporary immunity through antibodies in the donor\u2019s blood serum. This phenomenon\nis called passive immunity; it also occurs naturally during breastfeeding, which makes breastfed infants highly resistant to\ninfections during the first few months of life.\nAntibodies coat extracellular pathogens and neutralize them, as illustrated in Figure 33.24, by blocking key sites on the\npathogen that enhance their infectivity (such as receptors that \u201cdock\u201d pathogens on host cells). Antibody neutralization can\nprevent pathogens from entering and infecting host cells, as opposed to the CTL-mediated approach of killing cells that are\nalready infected to prevent progression of an established infection. The neutralized antibody-coated pathogens can then be\nfiltered by the spleen and eliminated in urine or feces.\n1464\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 33.24 Antibodies may inhibit infection by (a) preventing the antigen from binding its target, (b) tagging a\npathogen for destruction by macrophages or neutrophils, or (c) activating the complement cascade.\nAntibodies also mark pathogens for destruction by phagocytic cells, such as macrophages or neutrophils, because\nphagocytic cells are highly attracted to macromolecules complexed with antibodies. Phagocytic enhancement by antibodies\nis called opsonization. In a process called complement fixation, IgM and IgG in serum bind to antigens and provide docking\nsites onto which sequential complement proteins can bind. The combination of antibodies and complement enhances\nopsonization even further and promotes rapid clearing of pathogens.\nAffinity, Avidity, and Cross Reactivity\nNot all antibodies bind with the same strength, specificity, and stability. In fact, antibodies exhibit different affinities\n(attraction) depending on the molecular complementarity between antigen and antibody molecules, as illustrated in Figure\n33.25. An antibody with a higher affinity for a particular antigen would bind more strongly and stably, and thus would be\nexpected to present a more challenging defense against the pathogen corresponding to the specific antigen.\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\n1465\nFigure 33.25 (a) Affinity refers to the strength of single interaction between antigen and antibody, while avidity refers\nto the strength of all interactions combined. (b) An antibody may cross react with different epitopes.\nThe term avidity describes binding by antibody classes that are secreted as joined, multivalent structures (such as IgM\nand IgA). Although avidity measures the strength of binding, just as affinity does, the avidity is not simply the sum of the\naffinities of the antibodies in a multimeric structure. The avidity depends on the number of identical binding sites on the\nantigen being detected, as well as other physical and chemical factors. Typically, multimeric antibodies, such as pentameric\nIgM, are classified as having lower affinity than monomeric antibodies, but high avidity. Essentially, the fact that multimeric\nantibodies can bind many antigens simultaneously balances their slightly lower binding strength for each antibody/antigen\ninteraction.\nAntibodies secreted after binding to one epitope on an antigen may exhibit cross reactivity for the same or similar epitopes\non different antigens. Because an epitope corresponds to such a small region (the surface area of about four to six amino\nacids), it is possible for different macromolecules to exhibit the same molecular identities and orientations over short\nregions. Cross reactivity describes when an antibody binds not to the antigen that elicited its synthesis and secretion, but\nto a different antigen.\nCross reactivity can be beneficial if an individual develops immunity to several related pathogens despite having only been\nexposed to or vaccinated against one of them. For instance, antibody cross reactivity may occur against the similar surface\nstructures of various Gram-negative bacteria. Conversely, antibodies raised against pathogenic molecular components that\nresemble self molecules may incorrectly mark host cells for destruction and cause autoimmune damage. Patients who\ndevelop systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) commonly exhibit antibodies that react with their own DNA. These antibodies\nmay have been initially raised against the nucleic acid of microorganisms but later cross-reacted with self-antigens. This\nphenomenon is also called molecular mimicry.\nAntibodies of the Mucosal Immune System\nAntibodies synthesized by the mucosal immune system include IgA and IgM. Activated B cells differentiate into mucosal\n1466\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nplasma cells that synthesize and secrete dimeric IgA, and to a lesser extent, pentameric IgM. Secreted IgA is abundant in\ntears, saliva, breast milk, and in secretions of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Antibody secretion results in a local\nhumoral response at epithelial surfaces and prevents infection of the mucosa by binding and neutralizing pathogens.\n33.4 | Disruptions in the Immune System\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat is hypersensitivity?\n\u2022\nWhat is autoimmunity, and what is an example of an autoimmune disease?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nMuch of the information in this section is not within the scope for AP\u00ae.

SCID mice are used to study the immune\nsystem.\nFigure 33.26\nHypersensitivities\nMaladaptive immune responses toward harmless foreign substances or self antigens that occur after tissue sensitization\nare termed hypersensitivities. The types of hypersensitivities include immediate, delayed, and autoimmunity. A large\nproportion of the population is affected by one or more types of hypersensitivity.\nAllergies\nThe immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibody-mediated immune response\noccurs within minutes of exposure to a harmless antigen is called an allergy. In the United States, 20 percent of the\npopulation exhibits symptoms of allergy or asthma, whereas 55 percent test positive against one or more allergens. Upon\ninitial exposure to a potential allergen, an allergic individual synthesizes antibodies of the IgE class via the typical process of\nAPCs presenting processed antigen to TH cells that stimulate B cells to produce IgE. This class of antibodies also mediates\nthe immune response to parasitic worms. The constant domain of the IgE molecules interact with mast cells embedded\nin connective tissues. This process primes, or sensitizes, the tissue. Upon subsequent exposure to the same allergen, IgE\nmolecules on mast cells bind the antigen via their variable domains and stimulate the mast cell to release the modified amino\nacids histamine and serotonin; these chemical mediators then recruit eosinophils which mediate allergic responses. Figure\n33.27 shows an example of an allergic response to ragweed pollen. The effects of an allergic reaction range from mild\nsymptoms like sneezing and itchy, watery eyes to more severe or even life-threatening reactions involving intensely itchy\nwelts or hives, airway contraction with severe respiratory distress, and plummeting blood pressure. This extreme reaction\nis known as anaphylactic shock. If not treated with epinephrine to counter the blood pressure and breathing effects, this\ncondition can be fatal.\n1468\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 33.27 On first exposure to an allergen, an IgE antibody is synthesized by plasma cells in response to a\nharmless antigen. The IgE molecules bind to mast cells, and on secondary exposure, the mast cells release histamines\nand other modulators that affect the symptoms of allergy. (credit: modification of work by NIH)\nDelayed hypersensitivity is a cell-mediated immune response that takes approximately one to two days after secondary\nexposure for a maximal reaction to be observed. This type of hypersensitivity involves the TH1 cytokine-mediated\ninflammatory response and may manifest as local tissue lesions or contact dermatitis (rash or skin irritation). Delayed\nhypersensitivity occurs in some individuals in response to contact with certain types of jewelry or cosmetics. Delayed\nhypersensitivity facilitates the immune response to poison ivy and is also the reason why the skin test for tuberculosis results\nin a small region of inflammation on individuals who were previously exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. That is also\nwhy cortisone is used to treat such responses: it will inhibit cytokine production.\nAutoimmunity\nAutoimmunity is a type of hypersensitivity to self antigens that affects approximately five percent of the population. Most\ntypes of autoimmunity involve the humoral immune response. Antibodies that inappropriately mark self components as\nforeign are termed autoantibodies. In patients with the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis, muscle cell receptors that\ninduce contraction in response to acetylcholine are targeted by antibodies. The result is muscle weakness that may include\nmarked difficultly with fine and/or gross motor functions. In systemic lupus erythematosus, a diffuse autoantibody response\nto the individual\u2019s own DNA and proteins results in various systemic diseases. As illustrated in Figure 33.28, systemic\nlupus erythematosus may affect the heart, joints, lungs, skin, kidneys, central nervous system, or other tissues, causing tissue\ndamage via antibody binding, complement recruitment, lysis, and inflammation.\nFigure 33.28 Systemic lupus erythematosus is characterized by autoimmunity to the individual\u2019s own DNA and/or\nproteins, which leads to varied dysfunction of the organs. (credit: modification of work by Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m)\nAutoimmunity can develop with time, and its causes may be rooted in molecular mimicry. Antibodies and TCRs may bind\nself antigens that are structurally similar to pathogen antigens, which the immune receptors first raised. As an example,\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\n1469\ninfection with Streptococcus pyogenes (bacterium that causes strep throat) may generate antibodies or T cells that react\nwith heart muscle, which has a similar structure to the surface of S. pyogenes. These antibodies can damage heart muscle\nwith autoimmune attacks, leading to rheumatic fever. Insulin-dependent (Type 1) diabetes mellitus arises from a destructive\ninflammatory TH1 response against insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. Patients with this autoimmunity must be\ninjected with insulin that originates from other sources.\n1470\nChapter 33 | The Immune System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nadaptive immunity\naffinity\nallergy\nantibody\nantigen\nantigen-presenting cell (APC)\nautoantibody\nautoimmune response\nautoimmunity\navidity\nB cell\nbasophil\ncell-mediated immune response\nclonal selection\ncomplement system\ncross reactivity\ncytokine\ncytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)\ndendritic cell\neffector cell\neosinophil\nepitope\ngranzyme\nhelper T lymphocyte (TH)\nKEY TERMS\nimmunity that has memory and occurs after exposure to an antigen either from a pathogen or a\nvaccination\nattraction of molecular complementarity between antigen and antibody molecules\nimmune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibody-mediated immune response\noccurs within minutes of exposure to a harmless antigen\nprotein that is produced by plasma cells after stimulation by an antigen;

        "summary": "Disruptions in the immune system can occur through immunodeficiency, hypersensitivities, and autoimmunity. Immunodeficiency, which can be inherited or acquired from factors such as HIV infection, radiation, malnutrition, or chemical exposure, results from failures or delays in immune responses that allow pathogens or tumors to proliferate; examples include Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), Bare lymphocyte syndrome, MHC II deficiencies, and neutropenia. Hypersensitivities are maladaptive immune responses to harmless foreign substances or self antigens, and include immediate (allergies), delayed, and autoimmune types. Allergies involve IgE-mediated reactions to allergens like pollen, triggering mast cell release of histamine and other chemicals, with symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to life-threatening anaphylactic shock. Delayed hypersensitivities are T cell-mediated inflammatory responses that appear 1\u20132 days after exposure, as seen in poison ivy reactions or tuberculosis skin tests. Autoimmunity, affecting about 5% of people, occurs when antibodies (autoantibodies) target the body\u2019s own tissues, leading to diseases like myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatic fever (via molecular mimicry after infections such as strep throat), and type 1 diabetes, where immune cells destroy insulin-producing pancreatic cells."

In the animal kingdom, there are innumerable ways that\nspecies reproduce. Asexual reproduction produces genetically identical organisms (clones), whereas in sexual reproduction,\nthe genetic material of two individuals combines to produce offspring that are genetically different from their parents.\nDuring sexual reproduction the male gamete (sperm) may be placed inside the female\u2019s body for internal fertilization, or\nthe sperm and eggs may be released into the environment for external fertilization. Seahorses, like the one shown in Figure\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\n1487\n34.1, provide an example of the latter. Following a mating dance, the female lays eggs in the male seahorse\u2019s abdominal\nbrood pouch where they are fertilized. The eggs hatch and the offspring develop in the pouch for several weeks.\nSome animals are able to reproduce asexually by a process called parthenogenesis. While this process is common in\ninvertebrate animals, it is rare in vertebrates. At first scientists thought that vertebrate parthenogenesis happened only with\ncaptive animals, such as birds, snakes, and sharks; however, it was recently discovered that about one in five smalltooth\nsawfish in Florida is the result of parthenogenesis. This species of fish is endangered, and researchers suspect that this form\nof reproduction may be an adaptation to help keep the species from going extinct. You can read more about this exciting\nresearch here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32ocgiant) .\n34.1 | Reproduction Methods\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are advantages and disadvantages of asexual and sexual reproduction?\n\u2022\nWhat are examples of methods of asexual reproduction among animals?\n\u2022\nWhat are examples of methods of sexual reproduction among animals?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nMuch of the information about the different reproductive systems of animals is not within the scope for AP\u00ae. You likely\nstudied human reproduction in a health course or previous biology course. Reproduction is necessary for the survival\nof a species, and animals have evolved various reproductive strategies. In a previous chapter we learned that asexual\nreproduction via mitosis produces genetically identical organisms (clones). We also previously explored how meiosis\nfollowed by sexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically different from their parents. Whether or not the\nmaterial in this chapter is required or illustrative as part of your AP\u00ae course, you should find the concepts interesting and\nrelevant to your lives outside the classroom.\nBoth asexual and sexual reproductive strategies have their advantages and disadvantages. Organisms that reproduce\nasexually\u2014for example, bacteria and some eukaryotes\u2014may be at a disadvantage in an unstable or unpredictable\nenvironment because, barring mutation, the identical offspring may not have sufficient genetic variation to survive in new or\ndifferent conditions. On the other hand, the rapid rates of asexual reproduction may allow a speedy response to changing\nenvironmental conditions. Although sexual reproduction allows for greater genetic variation in offspring, organisms that\nreproduce sexually must maintain males and females in the population, which can limit the ability to colonize new habitats.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework. The AP\u00ae Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent\nfoundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP\u00ae exam\nquestions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.\nBig Idea 3\nLiving systems store, retrieve, transmit and respond to information essential to life\nprocesses.\nEnduring\nUnderstanding\n3.A\nHeritable information provides for continuity of life.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n3.A.2 In eukaryotes, heritable information is passed to the next generation via processes that\ninclude the cell cycle and mitosis or meiosis plus fertilization.\nScience\nPractice\n6.2 The student can construct explanations of phenomena based on evidence produced\nthrough scientific practices.\nLearning\nObjective\n3.9 The student is able to construct an explanation, using visual representations or\nnarratives, as to how DNA in chromosomes is transmitted to the next generation via mitosis,\nor meiosis followed by fertilization.\n1488\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nEssential\nKnowledge\n3.A.2 In eukaryotes, heritable information is passed to the next generation via processes that\ninclude the cell cycle and mitosis or meiosis plus fertilization.\nScience\nPractice\n7.1 The student can connect phenomena and models across spatial and temporal scales.\nLearning\nObjective\n3.10 The student is able to represent the connection between meiosis and increased genetic\ndiversity necessary for evolution.\nAsexual Reproduction\nAsexual reproduction occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms (bacteria) and in some eukaryotic single-celled and multi-\ncelled organisms. There are a number of ways that animals reproduce asexually.\nFission\nFission, also called binary fission, occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms and in some invertebrate, multi-celled organisms.\nAfter a period of growth, an organism splits into two separate organisms. Some unicellular eukaryotic organisms undergo\nbinary fission by mitosis. In other organisms, part of the individual separates and forms a second individual. This process\noccurs, for example, in many asteroid echinoderms through splitting of the central disk. Some sea anemones and some coral\npolyps (Figure 34.2) also reproduce through fission.\nFigure 34.2 Coral polyps reproduce asexually by fission. (credit: G. P. Schmahl, NOAA FGBNMS Manager)\nBudding\nBudding is a form of asexual reproduction that results from the outgrowth of a part of a cell or body region leading to a\nseparation from the original organism into two individuals. Budding occurs commonly in some invertebrate animals such\nas corals and hydras. In hydras, a bud forms that develops into an adult and breaks away from the main body, as illustrated\nin Figure 34.3, whereas in coral budding, the bud does not detach and multiplies as part of a new colony.\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\n1489\nFigure 34.3 Hydra reproduce asexually through budding.\nWatch a video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/budding_hydra) of a hydra budding.\nHydras can reproduce through budding. How will the daughter hydra appear?\na.\ngenetically identical to the mother\nb.\nnot genetically identical to the mother\nc.\ngenetically unique\nd.\nsmaller in size\nFragmentation\nFragmentation is the breaking of the body into two parts with subsequent regeneration. If the animal is capable of\nfragmentation, and the part is big enough, a separate individual will regrow.\nFor example, in many sea stars, asexual reproduction is accomplished by fragmentation. Figure 34.4 illustrates a sea star for\nwhich an arm of the individual is broken off and regenerates a new sea star. Fisheries workers have been known to try to kill\nthe sea stars eating their clam or oyster beds by cutting them in half and throwing them back into the ocean. Unfortunately\nfor the workers, the two parts can each regenerate a new half, resulting in twice as many sea stars to prey upon the oysters\nand clams. Fragmentation also occurs in annelid worms, turbellarians, and poriferans.\n1490\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 34.4 Sea stars can reproduce through fragmentation. The large arm, a fragment from another sea star, is\ndeveloping into a new individual.\nNote that in fragmentation, there is generally a noticeable difference in the size of the individuals, whereas in fission, two\nindividuals of approximate size are formed.\nParthenogenesis\nParthenogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction where an egg develops into a complete individual without being\nfertilized. The resulting offspring can be either haploid or diploid, depending on the process and the species.\nParthenogenesis occurs in invertebrates such as water flees, rotifers, aphids, stick insects, some ants, wasps, and bees. Bees\nand wasps use parthenogenesis to produce haploid males (called drones). If an egg is fertilized, it develops as a diploid\nfemale.\nSome vertebrate animals\u2014such as certain reptiles, amphibians, and fish\u2014also reproduce through parthenogenesis.\nAlthough more common in plants, parthenogenesis has been observed in animal species that were segregated by sex\nin terrestrial or marine zoos. Two female Komodo dragons, a hammerhead shark, and a blacktop shark have produced\nparthenogenic young when the females have been isolated from males.\nSexual Reproduction\nSexual reproduction is the combination of (usually haploid) reproductive cells from two individuals to form a third (usually\ndiploid) unique offspring. Sexual reproduction produces offspring with novel combinations of genes. This can be an\nadaptive advantage in unstable or unpredictable environments. As humans, we are used to thinking of animals as having two\nseparate sexes\u2014male and female\u2014determined at conception. However, in the animal kingdom, there are many variations\non this theme.\nLab Investigation\nAP\u00ae Biology Investigative Labs: Inquiry-Based, Investigation 7: Cell Division: Mitosis and Meiosis. Design\nand conduct a series of experiments to investigate how eukaryotic cells divide to produce genetically\nidentical cells or to produce gametes with half the normal DNA.\nThink About It\nWhy is sexual reproduction useful if two separate cells must be combined to form a third?\nHermaphroditism\nHermaphroditism occurs in animals where one individual has both male and female reproductive parts. Invertebrates such\nas earthworms, slugs, tapeworms and snails, shown in Figure 34.5, are often hermaphroditic. Hermaphrodites may self-\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\n1491\nfertilize or may mate with another of their species, fertilizing each other and both producing offspring. Self fertilization is\ncommon in animals that have limited mobility or are not motile, such as barnacles and clams.\nFigure 34.5 Many snails are hermaphrodites. When two individuals mate, they can produce up to one hundred eggs\neach. (credit: Assaf Shtilman)\nSex Determination\nMammalian sex determination is determined genetically by the presence of X and Y chromosomes. Individuals homozygous\nfor X (XX) are female and heterozygous individuals (XY) are male. The presence of a Y chromosome causes the\ndevelopment of male characteristics and its absence results in female characteristics. The XY system is also found in some\ninsects and plants.\nAvian sex determination is dependent on the presence of Z and W chromosomes. Homozygous for Z (ZZ) results in a male\nand heterozygous (ZW) results in a female. The W appears to be essential in determining the sex of the individual, similar\nto the Y chromosome in mammals. Some fish, crustaceans, insects (such as butterflies and moths), and reptiles use this\nsystem.\nThe sex of some species is not determined by genetics but by some aspect of the environment. Sex determination in some\ncrocodiles and turtles, for example, is often dependent on the temperature during critical periods of egg development. This\nis referred to as environmental sex determination, or more specifically as temperature-dependent sex determination. In\nmany turtles, cooler temperatures during egg incubation produce males and warm temperatures produce females. In some\ncrocodiles, moderate temperatures produce males and both warm and cool temperatures produce females. In some species,\nsex is both genetic- and temperature-dependent.\nIndividuals of some species change their sex during their lives, alternating between male and female. If the individual is\nfemale first, it is termed protogyny or \u201cfirst female,\u201d if it is male first, its termed protandry or \u201cfirst male.\u201d Oysters, for\nexample, are born male, grow, and become female and lay eggs; some oyster species change sex multiple times.\n1492\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nThe temperature during incubation determines the sex of loggerhead sea turtles while developing in their\neggs. If the temperature is warm enough, all will be females. If the temperature is cooler, all will be males.\nIf the temperature is just right, called the pivotal temperature, then there will be about half females and half\nmales.\nFigure 34.6 (credit: Hillebrand Steve, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)\nMany species of plants, including the sunflower pictured here, are capable of self-fertilization. If pollination\ndoes not occur with the help of pollinating insects, the stigma of the flower will wrap itself around the pollen\nof the same flower. Although self-fertilization forms seeds by meiosis, all of the resulting plants will be\nidentical. In other words, self-fertilization decreases genetic diversity.\nFigure 34.7 (credit: Wikipedia Commons, Helianthus annuus)\nThe sex of some crocodiles and turtles is dependent on the temperature during critical points in egg development.

        "summary": "Animals reproduce through a variety of asexual and sexual methods, each with advantages and disadvantages. Asexual reproduction, common in many invertebrates and some vertebrates, produces genetically identical offspring and includes mechanisms such as fission (splitting into two organisms), budding (growth of a new individual from the parent), fragmentation (body parts regenerating into new individuals), and parthenogenesis (development from an unfertilized egg, seen in some insects, reptiles, and fish). While asexual reproduction allows rapid population growth, it limits genetic diversity. Sexual reproduction, which combines haploid gametes from two parents to produce genetically unique offspring, offers greater genetic variation beneficial in changing environments but requires maintaining both sexes. Variations include hermaphroditism (individuals with both reproductive organs, capable of self-fertilization or mating), genetic sex determination systems (such as XY in mammals and ZW in birds), environmental sex determination (e.g., temperature-dependent systems in reptiles), and species that change sex during their lifetime."

(credit: \"OakleyOriginals\"/Flickr)\nPairs of fish that are not broadcast spawners may exhibit courtship behavior. This allows the female to select a particular\nmale. The trigger for egg and sperm release (spawning) causes the egg and sperm to be placed in a small area, enhancing\nthe possibility of fertilization.\nExternal fertilization in an aquatic environment protects the eggs from drying out. Broadcast spawning can result in a\ngreater mixture of the genes within a group, leading to higher genetic diversity and a greater chance of species survival in a\nhostile environment. For sessile aquatic organisms like sponges, broadcast spawning is the only mechanism for fertilization\nand colonization of new environments. The presence of the fertilized eggs and developing young in the water provides\nopportunities for predation resulting in a loss of offspring. Therefore, millions of eggs must be produced by individuals,\nand the offspring produced through this method must mature rapidly. The survival rate of eggs produced through broadcast\nspawning is low.\nInternal Fertilization\nInternal fertilization occurs most often in land-based animals, although some aquatic animals also use this method. There\nare three ways that offspring are produced following internal fertilization. In oviparity, fertilized eggs are laid outside the\nfemale\u2019s body and develop there, receiving nourishment from the yolk that is a part of the egg. This occurs in most bony\nfish, many reptiles, some cartilaginous fish, most amphibians, two mammals, and all birds. Reptiles and insects produce\nleathery eggs, while birds and turtles produce eggs with high concentrations of calcium carbonate in the shell, making them\nhard. Chicken eggs are an example of this second type.\nIn ovoviparity, fertilized eggs are retained in the female, but the embryo obtains its nourishment from the egg\u2019s yolk and\nthe young are fully developed when they are hatched. This occurs in some bony fish (like the guppy Lebistes reticulatus),\nsome sharks, some lizards, some snakes (such as the garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis), some vipers, and some invertebrate\nanimals (like the Madagascar hissing cockroach Gromphadorhina portentosa).\nIn viviparity the young develop within the female, receiving nourishment from the mother\u2019s blood through a placenta. The\noffspring develops in the female and is born alive. This occurs in most mammals, some cartilaginous fish, and a few reptiles.\nInternal fertilization has the advantage of protecting the fertilized egg from dehydration on land. The embryo is isolated\nwithin the female, which limits predation on the young. Internal fertilization enhances the fertilization of eggs by a specific\nmale. Fewer offspring are produced through this method, but their survival rate is higher than that for external fertilization.\nThe Evolution of Reproduction\nOnce multicellular organisms evolved and developed specialized cells, some also developed tissues and organs with\nspecialized functions. An early development in reproduction occurred in the Annelids. These organisms produce sperm and\neggs from undifferentiated cells in their coelom and store them in that cavity. When the coelom becomes filled, the cells are\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\n1495\nreleased through an excretory opening or by the body splitting open. Reproductive organs evolved with the development of\ngonads that produce sperm and eggs. These cells went through meiosis, an adaption of mitosis, which reduced the number\nof chromosomes in each reproductive cell by half, while increasing the number of cells through cell division.\nComplete reproductive systems were developed in insects, with separate sexes. Sperm are made in testes and then travel\nthrough coiled tubes to the epididymis for storage. Eggs mature in the ovary. When they are released from the ovary, they\ntravel to the uterine tubes for fertilization. Some insects have a specialized sac, called a spermatheca, which stores sperm\nfor later use, sometimes up to a year. Fertilization can be timed with environmental or food conditions that are optimal for\noffspring survival.\nVertebrates have similar structures, with a few differences. Non-mammals, such as birds and reptiles, have a common body\nopening, called a cloaca, for the digestive, excretory and reproductive systems. Coupling between birds usually involves\npositioning the cloaca openings opposite each other for transfer of sperm. Mammals have separate openings for the systems\nin the female and a uterus for support of developing offspring. The uterus has two chambers in species that produce large\nnumbers of offspring at a time, while species that produce one offspring, such as primates, have a single uterus.\nSperm transfer from the male to the female during reproduction ranges from releasing the sperm into the watery\nenvironment for external fertilization, to the joining of cloaca in birds, to the development of a penis for direct delivery into\nthe female\u2019s vagina in mammals.\nThink About It\nThe measure of an individual\u2019s reproductive success is based on its ability to produce offspring.

        "summary": "Fertilization is the fusion of a sperm and egg to begin sexual reproduction, occurring either externally or internally depending on the species and environment. External fertilization, common in aquatic animals such as fish, amphibians, and many invertebrates, involves releasing eggs and sperm into water, often through spawning triggered by environmental cues, leading to high genetic diversity but low survival rates due to predation, requiring large numbers of eggs. Internal fertilization, typical of terrestrial animals but also seen in some aquatic species, protects eggs from dehydration and predation, enhances fertilization by a specific male, and produces fewer offspring with higher survival rates. It occurs in three forms: oviparity, where eggs develop outside the female; ovoviviparity, where eggs develop inside but rely on yolk; and viviparity, where embryos develop inside, nourished by the mother\u2019s placenta. Evolutionary adaptations in reproduction include the development of reproductive organs, specialized structures for sperm storage and transfer, and strategies to maximize reproductive success based on environmental conditions."

Testosterone causes the undeveloped tissues to differentiate into male sexual organs. When\ntestosterone is absent, the tissues develop into female sexual tissues. Primitive gonads become testes or ovaries. Tissues that\nproduce a penis in males produce a clitoris in females. The tissue that will become the scrotum in a male becomes the labia\nin a female; that is, they are homologous structures.\nMale Reproductive Anatomy\nIn the male reproductive system, the scrotum houses the testicles or testes (singular: testis), including providing passage\nfor blood vessels, nerves, and muscles related to testicular function. The testes are a pair of male reproductive organs that\nproduce sperm and some reproductive hormones. Each testis is approximately 2.5 by 3.8 cm (1.5 by 1 in) in size and divided\ninto wedge-shaped lobules by connective tissue called septa. Coiled in each wedge are seminiferous tubules that produce\nsperm.\nSperm are immobile at body temperature; therefore, the scrotum and penis are external to the body, as illustrated in Figure\n34.10 so that a proper temperature is maintained for motility. In land mammals, the pair of testes must be suspended outside\nthe body at about 2\u00b0 C lower than body temperature to produce viable sperm. Infertility can occur in land mammals when\nthe testes do not descend through the abdominal cavity during fetal development.\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\n1497\nFigure 34.10 The reproductive structures of the human male are shown.\nWhich of the following statements about the male reproductive system is FALSE?\na.\nThe vas deferens carries sperm from the testes to the penis.\nb.\nSperm mature in the seminiferous tubules in the testes.\nc.\nBoth the prostate and bulbourethral glands produce components of the semen.\nd.\nThe prostate gland is located in the testes.\nSperm mature in seminiferous tubules that are coiled inside the testes, as illustrated in Figure 34.10. The walls of the\nseminiferous tubules are made up of the developing sperm cells, with the least developed sperm at the periphery of the\ntubule and the fully developed sperm in the lumen. The sperm cells are mixed with \u201cnursemaid\u201d cells called Sertoli cells\nwhich protect the germ cells and promote their development. Other cells mixed in the wall of the tubules are the interstitial\ncells of Leydig. These cells produce high levels of testosterone once the male reaches adolescence.\nWhen the sperm have developed flagella and are nearly mature, they leave the testicles and enter the epididymis, shown in\nFigure 34.10. This structure resembles a comma and lies along the top and posterior portion of the testes; it is the site of\nsperm maturation. The sperm leave the epididymis and enter the vas deferens (or ductus deferens), which carries the sperm,\nbehind the bladder, and forms the ejaculatory duct with the duct from the seminal vesicles. During a vasectomy, a section\nof the vas deferens is removed, preventing sperm from being passed out of the body during ejaculation and preventing\nfertilization.\nSemen is a mixture of sperm and spermatic duct secretions (about 10 percent of the total) and fluids from accessory glands\nthat contribute most of the semen\u2019s volume. Sperm are haploid cells, consisting of a flagellum as a tail, a neck that contains\nthe cell\u2019s energy-producing mitochondria, and a head that contains the genetic material. Figure 34.11 shows a micrograph\nof human sperm as well as a diagram of the parts of the sperm. An acrosome is found at the top of the head of the sperm.\nThis structure contains lysosomal enzymes that can digest the protective coverings that surround the egg to help the sperm\npenetrate and fertilize the egg. An ejaculate will contain from two to five milliliters of fluid with from 50\u2013120 million sperm\nper milliliter.\n1498\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 34.11 Human sperm, visualized using scanning electron microscopy, have a flagellum, neck, and head. (credit\nb: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nThe bulk of the semen comes from the accessory glands associated with the male reproductive system. These are the seminal\nvesicles, the prostate gland, and the bulbourethral gland, all of which are illustrated in Figure 34.10. The seminal vesicles\nare a pair of glands that lie along the posterior border of the urinary bladder. The glands make a solution that is thick,\nyellowish, and alkaline. As sperm are only motile in an alkaline environment, a basic pH is important to reverse the acidity\nof the vaginal environment. The solution also contains mucus, fructose (a sperm mitochondrial nutrient), a coagulating\nenzyme, ascorbic acid, and local-acting hormones called prostaglandins. The seminal vesicle glands account for 60 percent\nof the bulk of semen.\nThe penis, illustrated in Figure 34.10, is an organ that drains urine from the renal bladder and functions as a copulatory\norgan during intercourse. The penis contains three tubes of erectile tissue running through the length of the organ. These\nconsist of a pair of tubes on the dorsal side, called the corpus cavernosum, and a single tube of tissue on the ventral side,\ncalled the corpus spongiosum. This tissue will become engorged with blood, becoming erect and hard, in preparation for\nintercourse. The organ is inserted into the vagina culminating with an ejaculation. During intercourse, the smooth muscle\nsphincters at the opening to the renal bladder close and prevent urine from entering the penis. An orgasm is a two-stage\nprocess: first, glands and accessory organs connected to the testes contract, then semen (containing sperm) is expelled\nthrough the urethra during ejaculation. After intercourse, the blood drains from the erectile tissue and the penis becomes\nflaccid.\nThe walnut-shaped prostate gland surrounds the urethra, the connection to the urinary bladder. It has a series of short ducts\nthat directly connect to the urethra. The gland is a mixture of smooth muscle and glandular tissue. The muscle provides\nmuch of the force needed for ejaculation to occur. The glandular tissue makes a thin, milky fluid that contains citrate (a\nnutrient), enzymes, and prostate specific antigen (PSA). PSA is a proteolytic enzyme that helps to liquefy the ejaculate\nseveral minutes after release from the male. Prostate gland secretions account for about 30 percent of the bulk of semen.\nThe bulbourethral gland, or Cowper\u2019s gland, releases its secretion prior to the release of the bulk of the semen. It\nneutralizes any acid residue in the urethra left over from urine. This usually accounts for a couple of drops of fluid in\nthe total ejaculate and may contain a few sperm. Withdrawal of the penis from the vagina before ejaculation to prevent\npregnancy may not work if sperm are present in the bulbourethral gland secretions. The location and functions of the male\nreproductive organs are summarized in Table 34.1.\nMale Reproductive Anatomy\nOrgan\nLocation\nFunction\nScrotum\nExternal\nCarry and support testes\nPenis\nExternal\nDeliver urine, copulating organ\nTestes\nInternal\nProduce sperm and male hormones\nSeminal Vesicles\nInternal\nContribute to semen production\nProstate Gland\nInternal\nContribute to semen production\nTable 34.1\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\n1499\nMale Reproductive Anatomy\nOrgan\nLocation\nFunction\nBulbourethral Glands Internal\nClean urethra at ejaculation\nTable 34.1\nFemale Reproductive Anatomy\nA number of reproductive structures are exterior to the female\u2019s body. These include the breasts and the vulva, which\nconsists of the mons pubis, clitoris, labia majora, labia minora, and the vestibular glands, all illustrated in Figure 34.12.\nThe location and functions of the female reproductive organs are summarized in Table 34.2. The vulva is an area associated\nwith the vestibule which includes the structures found in the inguinal (groin) area of women. The mons pubis is a round,\nfatty area that overlies the pubic symphysis. The clitoris is a structure with erectile tissue that contains a large number of\nsensory nerves and serves as a source of stimulation during intercourse. The labia majora are a pair of elongated folds of\ntissue that run posterior from the mons pubis and enclose the other components of the vulva. The labia majora derive from\nthe same tissue that produces the scrotum in a male. The labia minora are thin folds of tissue centrally located within the\nlabia majora. These labia protect the openings to the vagina and urethra. The mons pubis and the anterior portion of the\nlabia majora become covered with hair during adolescence; the labia minora is hairless. The greater vestibular glands are\nfound at the sides of the vaginal opening and provide lubrication during intercourse.\nFigure 34.12 The reproductive structures of the human female are shown.

The size of the breast is determined by the amount of fat deposited behind\nthe gland. Each gland consists of 15 to 25 lobes that have ducts that empty at the nipple and that supply the nursing child\nwith nutrient- and antibody-rich milk to aid development and protect the child.\nInternal female reproductive structures include ovaries, oviducts, the uterus, and the vagina, shown in Figure 34.12. The\npair of ovaries is held in place in the abdominal cavity by a system of ligaments. Ovaries consist of a medulla and cortex:\nthe medulla contains nerves and blood vessels to supply the cortex with nutrients and remove waste. The outer layers of\ncells of the cortex are the functional parts of the ovaries. The cortex is made up of follicular cells that surround eggs that\ndevelop during fetal development in utero. During the menstrual period, a batch of follicular cells develops and prepares\nthe eggs for release. At ovulation, one follicle ruptures and one egg is released, as illustrated in Figure 34.13a.\nFigure 34.13 Oocytes develop in (a) follicles, located in the ovary. At the beginning of the menstrual cycle, the follicle\nmatures. At ovulation, the follicle ruptures, releasing the egg. The follicle becomes a corpus luteum, which eventually\ndegenerates. The (b) follicle in this light micrograph has an oocyte at its center. (credit a: modification of work by NIH;\nscale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nThe oviducts, or fallopian tubes, extend from the uterus in the lower abdominal cavity to the ovaries, but they are not in\ncontact with the ovaries. The lateral ends of the oviducts flare out into a trumpet-like structure and have a fringe of finger-\nlike projections called fimbriae, illustrated in Figure 34.12b. When an egg is released at ovulation, the fimbrae help the\nnon-motile egg enter into the tube and passage to the uterus. The walls of the oviducts are ciliated and are made up mostly\nof smooth muscle. The cilia beat toward the middle, and the smooth muscle contracts in the same direction, moving the\negg toward the uterus. Fertilization usually takes place within the oviducts and the developing embryo is moved toward the\nuterus for development. It usually takes the egg or embryo a week to travel through the oviduct. Sterilization in women is\ncalled a tubal ligation; it is analogous to a vasectomy in males in that the oviducts are severed and sealed.\nThe uterus is a structure about the size of a woman\u2019s fist. This is lined with an endometrium rich in blood vessels and\nmucus glands. The uterus supports the developing embryo and fetus during gestation. The thickest portion of the wall of\nthe uterus is made of smooth muscle. Contractions of the smooth muscle in the uterus aid in passing the baby through the\nvagina during labor. A portion of the lining of the uterus sloughs off during each menstrual period, and then builds up again\nin preparation for an implantation. Part of the uterus, called the cervix, protrudes into the top of the vagina. The cervix\nfunctions as the birth canal.\nThe vagina is a muscular tube that serves several purposes. It allows menstrual flow to leave the body. It is the receptacle\nfor the penis during intercourse and the vessel for the delivery of offspring. It is lined by stratified squamous epithelial cells\nto protect the underlying tissue.\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\n1501\nSexual Response during Intercourse\nThe sexual response in humans is both psychological and physiological. Both sexes experience sexual arousal through\npsychological and physical stimulation. There are four phases of the sexual response. During phase one, called excitement,\nvasodilation leads to vasocongestion in erectile tissues in both men and women. The nipples, clitoris, labia, and penis\nengorge with blood and become enlarged. Vaginal secretions are released to lubricate the vagina to facilitate intercourse.\nDuring the second phase, called the plateau, stimulation continues, the outer third of the vaginal wall enlarges with blood,\nand breathing and heart rate increase.\nDuring phase three, or orgasm, rhythmic, involuntary contractions of muscles occur in both sexes. In the male, the\nreproductive accessory glands and tubules constrict placing semen in the urethra, then the urethra contracts expelling the\nsemen through the penis. In women, the uterus and vaginal muscles contract in waves that may last slightly less than a\nsecond each. During phase four, or resolution, the processes described in the first three phases reverse themselves and return\nto their normal state. Men experience a refractory period in which they cannot maintain an erection or ejaculate for a period\nof time ranging from minutes to hours.\nGametogenesis (Spermatogenesis and Oogenesis)\nGametogenesis, the production of sperm and eggs, takes place through the process of meiosis. During meiosis, two cell\ndivisions separate the paired chromosomes in the nucleus and then separate the chromatids that were made during an earlier\nstage of the cell\u2019s life cycle. Meiosis produces haploid cells with half of each pair of chromosomes normally found in diploid\ncells. The production of sperm is called spermatogenesis and the production of eggs is called oogenesis.\nSpermatogenesis\nFigure 34.14 During spermatogenesis, four sperm result from each primary spermatocyte.\nSpermatogenesis, illustrated in Figure 34.14, occurs in the wall of the seminiferous tubules (Figure 34.10), with stem cells\nat the periphery of the tube and the spermatozoa at the lumen of the tube. Immediately under the capsule of the tubule are\ndiploid, undifferentiated cells. These stem cells, called spermatogonia (singular: spermatagonium), go through mitosis with\none offspring going on to differentiate into a sperm cell and the other giving rise to the next generation of sperm.\n1502\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nMeiosis starts with a cell called a primary spermatocyte. At the end of the first meiotic division, a haploid cell is produced\ncalled a secondary spermatocyte. This cell is haploid and must go through another meiotic cell division. The cell produced\nat the end of meiosis is called a spermatid and when it reaches the lumen of the tubule and grows a flagellum, it is called a\nsperm cell. Four sperm result from each primary spermatocyte that goes through meiosis.\nStem cells are deposited during gestation and are present at birth through the beginning of adolescence, but in an inactive\nstate. During adolescence, gonadotropic hormones from the anterior pituitary cause the activation of these cells and the\nproduction of viable sperm. This continues into old age.\nVisit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/spermatogenesis) to see the process of spermatogenesis.\nDuring spermatogenesis, which cells undergo meiosis to ultimately produce haploid gametes?\na.\nspermatogonia\nb.\nprimary spermatocytes\nc.\nsecondary spermatocytes\nd.\nspermatids\nOogenesis\nOogenesis, illustrated in Figure 34.15, occurs in the outermost layers of the ovaries. As with sperm production, oogenesis\nstarts with a germ cell, called an oogonium (plural: oogonia), but this cell undergoes mitosis to increase in number,\neventually resulting in up to about one to two million cells in the embryo.\nFigure 34.15 The process of oogenesis occurs in the ovary\u2019s outermost layer.\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\n1503\nThe cell starting meiosis is called a primary oocyte, as shown in Figure 34.15. This cell will start the first meiotic division\nand be arrested in its progress in the first prophase stage. At the time of birth, all future eggs are in the prophase stage.\nAt adolescence, anterior pituitary hormones cause the development of a number of follicles in an ovary. This results in\nthe primary oocyte finishing the first meiotic division. The cell divides unequally, with most of the cellular material and\norganelles going to one cell, called a secondary oocyte, and only one set of chromosomes and a small amount of cytoplasm\ngoing to the other cell. This second cell is called a polar body and usually dies. A secondary meiotic arrest occurs, this\ntime at the metaphase II stage. At ovulation, this secondary oocyte will be released and travel toward the uterus through the\noviduct. If the secondary oocyte is fertilized, the cell continues through the meiosis II, producing a second polar body and a\nfertilized egg containing all 46 chromosomes of a human being, half of them coming from the sperm.\nEgg production begins before birth, is arrested during meiosis until puberty, and then individual cells continue through at\neach menstrual cycle. One egg is produced from each meiotic process, with the extra chromosomes and chromatids going\ninto polar bodies that degenerate and are reabsorbed by the body.\nThink About It\nCompare spermatogenesis and oogenesis as to the timing of the processes and the number and type of cells finally\nproduced.\n34.4 | Hormonal Control of Human Reproduction\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the roles of male and female reproductive hormones?\n\u2022\nWhat is the link between the ovarian and menstrual cycles?\n\u2022\nWhat events are associated with menopause?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe information in this section is an application of concepts we learned when exploring the endocrine system in a\nprevious chapter. The human male and female reproductive cycles are regulated by the interaction of hormones from the\nhypothalamus and anterior pituitary with hormones from reproductive tissues and organs.

        "summary": "Human male and female reproductive systems develop from similar embryonic tissues, with testosterone guiding male differentiation and its absence resulting in female structures. Male anatomy includes external organs such as the penis and scrotum, and internal structures like the testes, epididymis, vas deferens, and accessory glands (seminal vesicles, prostate, and bulbourethral glands), which produce and deliver sperm within semen. Female anatomy includes external structures such as the vulva (mons pubis, clitoris, labia) and breasts, and internal structures including the ovaries, oviducts, uterus, and vagina, which produce eggs, facilitate fertilization, and support gestation. Sexual response progresses through excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution phases, involving physical changes and muscle contractions in both sexes. Gametogenesis occurs via meiosis: spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubules produces four haploid sperm from each primary spermatocyte continuously from puberty onward, while oogenesis in the ovary begins before birth, arrests until puberty, and typically produces one egg (plus polar bodies) per menstrual cycle, completing meiosis only if fertilization occurs."

        "text": "The cell starting meiosis is called a primary oocyte, as shown in Figure 34.15. This cell will start the first meiotic division\nand be arrested in its progress in the first prophase stage. At the time of birth, all future eggs are in the prophase stage.\nAt adolescence, anterior pituitary hormones cause the development of a number of follicles in an ovary. This results in\nthe primary oocyte finishing the first meiotic division. The cell divides unequally, with most of the cellular material and\norganelles going to one cell, called a secondary oocyte, and only one set of chromosomes and a small amount of cytoplasm\ngoing to the other cell. This second cell is called a polar body and usually dies. A secondary meiotic arrest occurs, this\ntime at the metaphase II stage. At ovulation, this secondary oocyte will be released and travel toward the uterus through the\noviduct. If the secondary oocyte is fertilized, the cell continues through the meiosis II, producing a second polar body and a\nfertilized egg containing all 46 chromosomes of a human being, half of them coming from the sperm.\nEgg production begins before birth, is arrested during meiosis until puberty, and then individual cells continue through at\neach menstrual cycle. One egg is produced from each meiotic process, with the extra chromosomes and chromatids going\ninto polar bodies that degenerate and are reabsorbed by the body.\nThink About It\nCompare spermatogenesis and oogenesis as to the timing of the processes and the number and type of cells finally\nproduced.\n34.4 | Hormonal Control of Human Reproduction\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the roles of male and female reproductive hormones?\n\u2022\nWhat is the link between the ovarian and menstrual cycles?\n\u2022\nWhat events are associated with menopause?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe information in this section is an application of concepts we learned when exploring the endocrine system in a\nprevious chapter.

FSH enters the testes and stimulates the Sertoli cells to begin\nfacilitating spermatogenesis using negative feedback, as illustrated in Figure 34.16. LH also enters the testes and stimulates\nthe interstitial cells of Leydig to make and release testosterone into the testes and the blood.\nTestosterone, the hormone responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics that develop in the male during adolescence,\nstimulates spermatogenesis. These secondary sex characteristics include a deepening of the voice, the growth of facial,\naxillary, and pubic hair, and the beginnings of the sex drive.\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\n1505\nFigure 34.16 Hormones control sperm production in a negative feedback system.\nA negative feedback system occurs in the male with rising levels of testosterone acting on the hypothalamus and anterior\npituitary to inhibit the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) , FSH, and LH. The Sertoli cells produce the\nhormone inhibin, which is released into the blood when the sperm count is too high. This inhibits the release of GnRH and\nFSH, which will cause spermatogenesis to slow down. If the sperm count reaches 20 million/ml, the Sertoli cells cease the\nrelease of inhibin, and the sperm count increases.\nFemale Hormones\nThe control of reproduction in females is more complex. As with the male, the anterior pituitary hormones cause the release\nof the hormones FSH and LH. In addition, estrogens and progesterone are released from the developing follicles. Estrogen\nis the reproductive hormone in females that assists in endometrial regrowth, ovulation, and calcium absorption; it is also\nresponsible for the secondary sexual characteristics of females. These include breast development, flaring of the hips, and a\nshorter period necessary for bone maturation. Progesterone assists in endometrial re-growth and inhibition of FSH and LH\nrelease.\nIn females, FSH stimulates development of egg cells, called ova, which develop in structures called follicles. Follicle cells\nproduce the hormone inhibin, which inhibits FSH production. LH also plays a role in the development of ova, induction of\novulation, and stimulation of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries. Estradiol and progesterone are steroid\nhormones that prepare the body for pregnancy. Estradiol produces secondary sex characteristics in females, while both\nestradiol and progesterone regulate the menstrual cycle.\nThe Ovarian Cycle and the Menstrual Cycle\nThe ovarian cycle governs the preparation of endocrine tissues and release of eggs, while the menstrual cycle governs the\npreparation and maintenance of the uterine lining. These cycles occur concurrently and are coordinated over a 22\u201332 day\ncycle, with an average length of 28 days.\nThe first half of the ovarian cycle is the follicular phase shown in Figure 34.17. Slowly rising levels of FSH and LH\ncause the growth of follicles on the surface of the ovary. This process prepares the egg for ovulation. As the follicles grow,\nthey begin releasing estrogens and a low level of progesterone. Progesterone maintains the endometrium to help ensure\npregnancy. The trip through the fallopian tube takes about seven days. At this stage of development, called the morula, there\nare 30-60 cells. If pregnancy implantation does not occur, the lining is sloughed off. After about five days, estrogen levels\nrise and the menstrual cycle enters the proliferative phase. The endometrium begins to regrow, replacing the blood vessels\nand glands that deteriorated during the end of the last cycle.\n1506\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 34.17 The ovarian and menstrual cycles of female reproduction are regulated by hormones produced by\nthe hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovaries.\nWhich of the following statements about hormone regulation of the female reproductive cycle is true?\na.\nLH and FSH are produced in the ovaries, and estradiol and progesterone are produced in the pituitary.\nb.\nEstradiol and progesterone secreted from the corpus luteum cause the myometrium to thicken.\nc.\nProgesterone is produced by the corpus luteum.\nd.\nSecretion of GnRH by the hypothalamus is inhibited by high levels of estradiol, but stimulated by low levels\nof estradiol.\nJust prior to the middle of the cycle (approximately day 14), the high level of estrogen causes FSH and especially LH to rise\nrapidly, then fall. The spike in LH causes ovulation: the most mature follicle, like that shown in Figure 34.18, ruptures and\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\n1507\nreleases its egg. The follicles that did not rupture degenerate and their eggs are lost. The level of estrogen decreases when\nthe extra follicles degenerate.\nFigure 34.18 This mature egg follicle may rupture and release an egg. (credit: scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nFollowing ovulation, the ovarian cycle enters its luteal phase, illustrated in Figure 34.17 and the menstrual cycle enters its\nsecretory phase, both of which run from about day 15 to 28. The luteal and secretory phases refer to changes in the ruptured\nfollicle. The cells in the follicle undergo physical changes and produce a structure called a corpus luteum. The corpus\nluteum produces estrogen and progesterone. The progesterone facilitates the regrowth of the uterine lining and inhibits the\nrelease of further FSH and LH. The uterus is being prepared to accept a fertilized egg, should it occur during this cycle. The\ninhibition of FSH and LH prevents any further eggs and follicles from developing, while the progesterone is elevated. The\nlevel of estrogen produced by the corpus luteum increases to a steady level for the next few days.\nIf no fertilized egg is implanted into the uterus, the corpus luteum degenerates and the levels of estrogen and progesterone\ndecrease. The endometrium begins to degenerate as the progesterone levels drop, initiating the next menstrual cycle. The\ndecrease in progesterone also allows the hypothalamus to send GnRH to the anterior pituitary, releasing FSH and LH and\nstarting the cycles again. Figure 34.19 visually compares the ovarian and uterine cycles as well as the commensurate\nhormone levels.\n1508\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 34.19 Rising and falling hormone levels result in progression of the ovarian and menstrual cycles.

Menstrual periods\nbecome less frequent and finally cease; this is menopause. There are still eggs and potential follicles on the ovaries, but\nwithout the stimulation of FSH and LH, they will not produce a viable egg to be released. The outcome of this is the inability\nto have children.\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\n1509\nThe side effects of menopause include hot flashes, heavy sweating (especially at night), headaches, some hair loss, muscle\npain, vaginal dryness, insomnia, depression, weight gain, and mood swings. Estrogen is involved in calcium metabolism\nand, without it, blood levels of calcium decrease. To replenish the blood, calcium is lost from bone which may decrease\nthe bone density and lead to osteoporosis. Supplementation of estrogen in the form of hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\ncan prevent bone loss, but the therapy can have negative side effects. While HRT is thought to give some protection from\ncolon cancer, osteoporosis, heart disease, macular degeneration, and possibly depression, its negative side effects include\nincreased risk of: stroke or heart attack, blood clots, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, gall bladder disease,\nand possibly dementia.\nReproductive Endocrinologist\nA reproductive endocrinologist is a physician who treats a variety of hormonal disorders related to\nreproduction and infertility in both men and women. The disorders include menstrual problems, infertility,\npregnancy loss, sexual dysfunction, and menopause. Doctors may use fertility drugs, surgery, or assisted\nreproductive techniques (ART) in their therapy. ART involves the use of procedures to manipulate the egg\nor sperm to facilitate reproduction, such as in vitro fertilization.\nReproductive endocrinologists undergo extensive medical training, first in a four-year residency in obstetrics\nand gynecology, then in a three-year fellowship in reproductive endocrinology. To be board certified in this\narea, the physician must pass written and oral exams in both areas.\n34.5 | Fertilization and Early Embryonic Development\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow does fertilization occur?\n\u2022\nHow does the embryo form from the zygote?\n\u2022\nWhat are the roles of cleavage and fertilization in animal development?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe information in this section is not within the scope for AP\u00ae other than to note that the process by which an organism\ndevelops from a single-celled zygote to a multi-cellular organism with specialized cells, tissues, and organs is complex and\nwell regulated.

In mammals, the egg is protected by a layer of extracellular\nmatrix consisting mainly of glycoproteins called the zona pellucida. When a sperm binds to the zona pellucida, a\nseries of biochemical events, called the acrosomal reactions, take place. In placental mammals, the acrosome contains\ndigestive enzymes that initiate the degradation of the glycoprotein matrix protecting the egg and allowing the sperm plasma\nmembrane to fuse with the egg plasma membrane, as illustrated in Figure 34.20b. The fusion of these two membranes\ncreates an opening through which the sperm nucleus is transferred into the ovum. The nuclear membranes of the egg and\nsperm break down and the two haploid genomes condense to form a diploid genome.\n1510\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\n",
        "summary": "Hormonal control of human reproduction involves interactions between the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary, and reproductive organs through chemical signaling and feedback mechanisms. In males, the hypothalamus stimulates the release of FSH and LH at puberty; FSH acts on Sertoli cells to support spermatogenesis, while LH stimulates Leydig cells to produce testosterone, which promotes sperm production, secondary sexual characteristics, and exerts negative feedback to regulate GnRH, FSH, and LH. In females, FSH stimulates follicle and egg development while LH supports ovulation and hormone production; follicles release estrogen, promoting secondary sexual traits, endometrial growth, and cycle regulation, with progesterone from the corpus luteum preparing the uterus for pregnancy and inhibiting further FSH/LH release. The ovarian cycle (follicular and luteal phases) and menstrual cycle (proliferative and secretory phases) are coordinated; rising estrogen triggers an LH surge leading to ovulation, after which progesterone dominates to maintain uterine lining. If fertilization does not occur, hormone levels drop, prompting menstruation and restarting the cycle. Menopause occurs when ovarian follicles no longer respond to FSH and LH, ending reproductive capacity and causing symptoms related to estrogen decline, sometimes treated with hormone replacement therapy despite potential risks."

(b) Acrosomal reactions\nhelp the sperm degrade the glycoprotein matrix protecting the egg and allow the sperm to transfer its nucleus. (credit:\n(b) modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nTo ensure that no more than one sperm fertilizes the egg, once the acrosomal reactions take place at one location of the egg\nmembrane, the egg releases proteins in other locations to prevent other sperm from fusing with the egg. If this mechanism\nfails, multiple sperm can fuse with the egg, resulting in polyspermy. The resulting embryo is not genetically viable and dies\nwithin a few days.\nCleavage and Blastula Stage\nThe development of multi-cellular organisms begins from a single-celled zygote, which undergoes rapid cell division to\nform the blastula. The rapid, multiple rounds of cell division are termed cleavage. Cleavage is illustrated in (Figure 34.21a).\nAfter the cleavage has produced over 100 cells, the embryo is called a blastula. The blastula is usually a spherical layer of\ncells (the blastoderm) surrounding a fluid-filled or yolk-filled cavity (the blastocoel). Mammals at this stage form a structure\ncalled the blastocyst, characterized by an inner cell mass that is distinct from the surrounding blastula, shown in Figure\n34.21b. During cleavage, the cells divide without an increase in mass; that is, one large single-celled zygote divides into\nmultiple smaller cells. Each cell within the blastula is called a blastomere.\nFigure 34.21 (a) During cleavage, the zygote rapidly divides into multiple cells without increasing in size. (b) The\ncells rearrange themselves to form a hollow ball with a fluid-filled or yolk-filled cavity called the blastula. (credit a:\nmodification of work by Gray\u2019s Anatomy; credit b: modification of work by Pearson Scott Foresman, donated to the\nWikimedia Foundation)\nCleavage can take place in two ways: holoblastic (total) cleavage or meroblastic (partial) cleavage. The type of cleavage\ndepends on the amount of yolk in the eggs. In placental mammals (including humans) where nourishment is provided by the\nmother\u2019s body, the eggs have a very small amount of yolk and undergo holoblastic cleavage. Other species, such as birds,\nwith a lot of yolk in the egg to nourish the embryo during development, undergo meroblastic cleavage.\nIn mammals, the blastula forms the blastocyst in the next stage of development. Here the cells in the blastula arrange\nthemselves in two layers: the inner cell mass, and an outer layer called the trophoblast. The inner cell mass is also known\nas the embryoblast and this mass of cells will go on to form the embryo. At this stage of development, illustrated in Figure\n34.22 the inner cell mass consists of embryonic stem cells that will differentiate into the different cell types needed by the\norganism. The trophoblast will contribute to the placenta and nourish the embryo.\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\n1511\nFigure 34.22 The rearrangement of the cells in the mammalian blastula to two layers\u2014the inner cell mass and the\ntrophoblast\u2014results in the formation of the blastocyst.\nVisit the Virtual Human Embryo project (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/human_embryo) at the Endowment for\nHuman Development site to step through an interactive that shows the stages of embryo development, including\nmicrographs and rotating 3-D images.\nWhich early embryonic stage is characterized by a fluid-filled cavity with an inner cell mass surrounded by a layer of\ncells?\na.\nblastocyst\nb.\nblastula\nc.\nblastocoel\nd.\ngastrula\nGastrulation\nThe typical blastula is a ball of cells. The next stage in embryonic development is the formation of the body plan. The\ncells in the blastula rearrange themselves spatially to form three layers of cells. This process is called gastrulation. During\ngastrulation, the blastula folds upon itself to form the three layers of cells. Each of these layers is called a germ layer and\neach germ layer differentiates into different organ systems.\nThe three germs layers, shown in Figure 34.23, are the endoderm, the ectoderm, and the mesoderm. The ectoderm gives\nrise to the nervous system and the epidermis. The mesoderm gives rise to the muscle cells and connective tissue in the body.\nThe endoderm gives rise to columnar cells found in the digestive system and many internal organs.\n1512\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 34.23 The three germ layers give rise to different cell types in the animal body.

Would you select\nthe sex of your child or select for their attractiveness, strength, or intelligence? How far would you go to\nmaximize the possibility of resistance to disease? The genetic engineering of a human child, the production\nof \"designer babies\" with desirable phenotypic characteristics, was once a topic restricted to science fiction.\nThis is the case no longer: science fiction is now overlapping into science fact. Many phenotypic choices\nfor offspring are already available, with many more likely to be possible in the not too distant future. Which\ntraits should be selected and how they should be selected are topics of much debate within the worldwide\nmedical community. The ethical and moral line is not always clear or agreed upon, and some fear that\nmodern reproductive technologies could lead to a new form of eugenics.\nEugenics is the use of information and technology from a variety of sources to improve the genetic\nmakeup of the human race. The goal of creating genetically superior humans was quite prevalent (although\ncontroversial) in several countries during the early 20th century, but fell into disrepute when Nazi Germany\ndeveloped an extensive eugenics program in the 1930's and 40's. As part of their program, the Nazis\nforcibly sterilized hundreds of thousands of the so-called \"unfit\" and killed tens of thousands of institutionally\ndisabled people as part of a systematic program to develop a genetically superior race of Germans known\nas Aryans. Ever since, eugenic ideas have not been as publicly expressed, but there are still those who\npromote them.\nEfforts have been made in the past to control traits in human children using donated sperm from men with\ndesired traits. In fact, eugenicist Robert Klark Graham established a sperm bank in 1980 that included\nsamples exclusively from donors with high IQs. The \"genius\" sperm bank failed to capture the public's\nimagination and the operation closed in 1999.\nIn more recent times, the procedure known as prenatal genetic diagnosis (PGD) has been developed. PGD\ninvolves the screening of human embryos as part of the process of in vitro fertilization, during which embryos\nare conceived and grown outside the mother's body for some period of time before they are implanted. The\nterm PGD usually refers to both the diagnosis, selection, and the implantation of the selected embryos.\nIn the least controversial use of PGD, embryos are tested for the presence of alleles which cause genetic\ndiseases such as sickle cell disease, muscular dystrophy, and hemophilia, in which a single disease-causing\nallele or pair of alleles has been identified. By excluding embryos containing these alleles from implantation\ninto the mother, the disease is prevented, and the unused embryos are either donated to science or\ndiscarded. There are relatively few in the worldwide medical community that question the ethics of this type\n1514\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nof procedure, which allows individuals scared to have children because of the alleles they carry to do so\nsuccessfully. The major limitation to this procedure is its expense. Not usually covered by medical insurance\nand thus out of reach financially for most couples, only a very small percentage of all live births use such\ncomplicated methodologies. Yet, even in cases like these where the ethical issues may seem to be clear-\ncut, not everyone agrees with the morality of these types of procedures. For example, to those who take\nthe position that human life begins at conception, the discarding of unused embryos, a necessary result of\nPGD, is unacceptable under any circumstances.\nA murkier ethical situation is found in the selection of a child's sex, which is easily performed by PGD.\nCurrently, countries such as Great Britain have banned the selection of a child's sex for reasons other than\npreventing sex-linked diseases. Other countries allow the procedure for \"family balancing\", based on the\ndesire of some parents to have at least one child of each sex. Still others, including the United States, have\ntaken a scattershot approach to regulating these practices, essentially leaving it to the individual practicing\nphysician to decide which practices are acceptable and which are not.\nEven murkier are rare instances of disabled parents, such as those with deafness or dwarfism, who select\nembryos via PGD to ensure that they share their disability.

        "summary": "Fertilization is the fusion of haploid egg and sperm gametes to form a diploid zygote, a process in mammals facilitated by the acrosomal reaction, in which enzymes from the sperm break down the egg\u2019s protective glycoprotein layer (zona pellucida) to allow membrane fusion and transfer of the sperm nucleus. Mechanisms prevent polyspermy, as fusion by multiple sperm results in nonviable embryos. The zygote undergoes rapid cell divisions, called cleavage, without increasing in size, forming a blastula\u2014a hollow sphere of cells surrounding a fluid- or yolk-filled cavity (blastocoel). In mammals, this stage produces a blastocyst with an inner cell mass (embryoblast) that will become the embryo and an outer trophoblast that will contribute to the placenta. Cleavage can be holoblastic (complete, in low-yolk eggs like those of mammals) or meroblastic (partial, in high-yolk eggs like those of birds). Following this, gastrulation rearranges the blastula into three germ layers: ectoderm (forming skin and nervous system), mesoderm (muscles and connective tissues), and endoderm (lining of digestive tract and many internal organs), establishing the basic body plan for further development."

Not usually covered by medical insurance\nand thus out of reach financially for most couples, only a very small percentage of all live births use such\ncomplicated methodologies. Yet, even in cases like these where the ethical issues may seem to be clear-\ncut, not everyone agrees with the morality of these types of procedures. For example, to those who take\nthe position that human life begins at conception, the discarding of unused embryos, a necessary result of\nPGD, is unacceptable under any circumstances.\nA murkier ethical situation is found in the selection of a child's sex, which is easily performed by PGD.\nCurrently, countries such as Great Britain have banned the selection of a child's sex for reasons other than\npreventing sex-linked diseases. Other countries allow the procedure for \"family balancing\", based on the\ndesire of some parents to have at least one child of each sex. Still others, including the United States, have\ntaken a scattershot approach to regulating these practices, essentially leaving it to the individual practicing\nphysician to decide which practices are acceptable and which are not.\nEven murkier are rare instances of disabled parents, such as those with deafness or dwarfism, who select\nembryos via PGD to ensure that they share their disability.

Formation of body axes (lateral-medial,\ndorsal-ventral, and anterior-posterior) is another important developmental stage under genetic control.\nInformation presented and examples highlighted in this section are not within the scope for AP\u00ae and do not align to the\nCurriculum Framework.\nGastrulation leads to the formation of the three germ layers that give rise, during further development, to the different organs\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\n1515\nin the animal body. This process is called organogenesis. Organogenesis is characterized by rapid and precise movements\nof the cells within the embryo.\nOrganogenesis\nOrgans form from the germ layers through the process of differentiation. During differentiation, the embryonic stem cells\nexpress specific sets of genes which will determine their ultimate cell type. For example, some cells in the ectoderm\nwill express the genes specific to skin cells. As a result, these cells will differentiate into epidermal cells. The process of\ndifferentiation is regulated by cellular signaling cascades.\nScientists study organogenesis extensively in the lab in fruit flies (Drosophila) and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.\nDrosophila have segments along their bodies, and the patterning associated with the segment formation has allowed\nscientists to study which genes play important roles in organogenesis along the length of the embryo at different time points.\nThe nematode C.elegans has roughly 1000 somatic cells and scientists have studied the fate of each of these cells during\ntheir development in the nematode life cycle. There is little variation in patterns of cell lineage between individuals, unlike\nin mammals where cell development from the embryo is dependent on cellular cues.\nIn vertebrates, one of the primary steps during organogenesis is the formation of the neural system. The ectoderm forms\nepithelial cells and tissues, and neuronal tissues. During the formation of the neural system, special signaling molecules\ncalled growth factors signal some cells at the edge of the ectoderm to become epidermis cells. The remaining cells in the\ncenter form the neural plate. If the signaling by growth factors were disrupted, then the entire ectoderm would differentiate\ninto neural tissue.\nThe neural plate undergoes a series of cell movements where it rolls up and forms a tube called the neural tube, as\nillustrated in Figure 34.25. In further development, the neural tube will give rise to the brain and the spinal cord.\nFigure 34.25 The central region of the ectoderm forms the neural tube, which gives rise to the brain and the spinal\ncord.\nThe mesoderm that lies on either side of the vertebrate neural tube will develop into the various connective tissues of the\nanimal body. A spatial pattern of gene expression reorganizes the mesoderm into groups of cells called somites with spaces\n1516\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nbetween them. The somites, illustrated in Figure 34.26 will further develop into the ribs, lungs, and segmental (spine)\nmuscle. The mesoderm also forms a structure called the notochord, which is rod-shaped and forms the central axis of the\nanimal body.\nFigure 34.26 In this five-week old human embryo, somites are segments along the length of the body. (credit:\nmodification of work by Ed Uthman)\nVertebrate Axis Formation\nEven as the germ layers form, the ball of cells still retains its spherical shape. However, animal bodies have lateral-medial\n(left-right), dorsal-ventral (back-belly), and anterior-posterior (head-feet) axes, illustrated in Figure 34.27.\nFigure 34.27 Animal bodies have three axes for symmetry. (credit: modification of work by NOAA)\nHow are these established? In one of the most seminal experiments ever to be carried out in developmental biology,\nSpemann and Mangold took dorsal cells from one embryo and transplanted them into the belly region of another embryo.\nThey found that the transplanted embryo now had two notochords: one at the dorsal site from the original cells and another\nat the transplanted site. This suggested that the dorsal cells were genetically programmed to form the notochord and define\nthe axis. Since then, researchers have identified many genes that are responsible for axis formation. Mutations in these genes\nleads to the loss of symmetry required for organism development.\nAnimal bodies have externally visible symmetry. However, the internal organs are not symmetric. For example, the heart\nis on the left side and the liver on the right. The formation of the central left-right axis is an important process during\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\n1517\ndevelopment. This internal asymmetry is established very early during development and involves many genes. Research is\nstill ongoing to fully understand the developmental implications of these genes.\n34.7 | Human Pregnancy and Birth\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the stages of fetal development during the first three trimesters of gestation?\n\u2022\nWhat the events in labor and delivery?\n\u2022\nWhat are the efficacy and duration of various types of contraception?\n\u2022\nWhat are causes of infertility and the therapeutic options available?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe information in this section is not within the scope for AP\u00ae, and you likely studied this information in a prior health\nclass.

In vertebrates, a key early event is the formation of the nervous system from the ectoderm, where growth factors direct outer cells to become epidermis while inner cells form the neural plate, which folds into the neural tube that develops into the brain and spinal cord. The mesoderm alongside the neural tube forms somites, which give rise to structures such as ribs, lungs, and spinal muscles, and produces the notochord, the body\u2019s central axis. Vertebrate development also involves establishing body axes\u2014lateral-medial, dorsal-ventral, and anterior-posterior\u2014controlled by genetic programs, as demonstrated in classic transplantation experiments by Spemann and Mangold. Axis formation includes establishing both external symmetry and internal asymmetry, such as the positioning of the heart and liver, processes that rely on genetic regulation and are still under active study."

Implantation occurs eight or nine\ndays later.(credit: Ed Uthman)\nThe gestation period is divided into three equal periods or trimesters. During the first two to four weeks of the first trimester,\nnutrition and waste are handled by the endometrial lining through diffusion. As the trimester progresses, the outer layer of\nthe embryo begins to merge with the endometrium, and the placenta forms. This organ takes over the nutrient and waste\nrequirements of the embryo and fetus, with the mother\u2019s blood passing nutrients to the placenta and removing waste from\nit. Chemicals from the fetus, such as bilirubin, are processed by the mother\u2019s liver for elimination. Some of the mother\u2019s\nimmunoglobulins will pass through the placenta, providing passive immunity against some potential infections.\nInternal organs and body structures begin to develop during the first trimester. By five weeks, limb buds, eyes, the heart, and\nliver have been basically formed. By eight weeks, the term fetus applies, and the body is essentially formed, as shown in\nFigure 34.29. The individual is about five centimeters (two inches) in length and many of the organs, such as the lungs and\nliver, are not yet functioning. Exposure to any toxins is especially dangerous during the first trimester, as all of the body\u2019s\norgans and structures are going through initial development. Anything that affects that development can have a severe effect\non the fetus\u2019 survival.\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\n1519\nFigure 34.29 Fetal development is shown at nine weeks gestation. (credit: Ed Uthman)\nDuring the second trimester, the fetus grows to about 30 cm (12 inches), as shown in Figure 34.30. It becomes active and\nthe mother usually feels the first movements. All organs and structures continue to develop. The placenta has taken over\nthe functions of nutrition and waste and the production of estrogen and progesterone from the corpus luteum, which has\ndegenerated. The placenta will continue functioning up through the delivery of the baby.\nFigure 34.30 This fetus is just entering the second trimester, when the placenta takes over more of the functions\nperformed as the baby develops. (credit: National Museum of Health and Medicine)\nDuring the third trimester, the fetus grows to 3 to 4 kg (6 \u00bd -8 \u00bd lbs.) and about 50 cm (19-20 inches) long, as illustrated\nin Figure 34.31. This is the period of the most rapid growth during the pregnancy. Organ development continues to birth\n(and some systems, such as the nervous system and liver, continue to develop after birth). The mother will be at her most\n1520\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nuncomfortable during this trimester. She may urinate frequently due to pressure on the bladder from the fetus. There may\nalso be intestinal blockage and circulatory problems, especially in her legs. Clots may form in her legs due to pressure from\nthe fetus on returning veins as they enter the abdominal cavity.\nFigure 34.31 There is rapid fetal growth during the third trimester.

Toward the\nend of the third trimester, estrogen causes receptors on the uterine wall to develop and bind the hormone oxytocin. At this\ntime, the baby reorients, facing forward and down with the back or crown of the head engaging the cervix (uterine opening).\nThis causes the cervix to stretch and nerve impulses are sent to the hypothalamus, which signals for the release of oxytocin\nfrom the posterior pituitary. The oxytocin causes the smooth muscle in the uterine wall to contract. At the same time, the\nplacenta releases prostaglandins into the uterus, increasing the contractions. A positive feedback relay occurs between the\nuterus, hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary to assure an adequate supply of oxytocin. As more smooth muscle cells\nare recruited, the contractions increase in intensity and force.\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\n1521\nThere are three stages to labor. During stage one, the cervix thins and dilates. This is necessary for the baby and placenta to\nbe expelled during birth. The cervix will eventually dilate to about 10 cm. During stage two, the baby is expelled from the\nuterus. The uterus contracts and the mother pushes as she compresses her abdominal muscles to aid the delivery. The last\nstage is the passage of the placenta after the baby has been born and the organ has completely disengaged from the uterine\nwall. If labor should stop before stage two is reached, synthetic oxytocin can be administered to restart and maintain labor.\nAn alternative to labor and delivery is the surgical delivery of the baby through a procedure called a Caesarian section. This\nis major abdominal surgery and can lead to post-surgical complications for the mother, but in some cases it may be the only\nway to safely deliver the baby.\nThe mother\u2019s mammary glands go through changes during the third trimester to prepare for lactation and breastfeeding.\nWhen the baby begins suckling at the breast, signals are sent to the hypothalamus causing the release of prolactin from the\nanterior pituitary. Prolactin causes the mammary glands to produce milk. Oxytocin is also released, promoting the release\nof the milk. The milk contains nutrients for the baby\u2019s development and growth as well as immunoglobulins to protect the\nchild from bacterial and viral infections.\nContraception and Birth Control\nThe prevention of a pregnancy comes under the terms contraception or birth control. Strictly speaking, contraception refers\nto preventing the sperm and egg from joining. Both terms are, however, frequently used interchangeably.\nContraceptive Methods\nMethod\nExamples\nFailure Rate in Typical Use\nOver 12 Months\nBarrier\nmale condom, female condom, sponge, cervical cap,\ndiaphragm, spermicides\n15 to 24%\nHormonal\noral, patch, vaginal ring\n8%\ninjection\n3%\nimplant\nless than 1%\nOther\nnatural family planning\n12 to 25%\nwithdrawal\n27%\nsterilization\nless than 1%\nTable 34.3\nTable 34.3 lists common methods of contraception. The failure rates listed are not the ideal rates that could be realized, but\nthe typical rates that occur. A failure rate is the number of pregnancies resulting from the method\u2019s use over a twelve-month\nperiod. Barrier methods, such as condoms, cervical caps, and diaphragms, block sperm from entering the uterus, preventing\nfertilization. Spermicides are chemicals that are placed in the vagina that kill sperm. Sponges, which are saturated with\nspermicides, are placed in the vagina at the cervical opening. Combinations of spermicidal chemicals and barrier methods\nachieve lower failure rates than do the methods when used separately.\nNearly a quarter of the couples using barrier methods, natural family planning, or withdrawal can expect a failure of the\nmethod. Natural family planning is based on the monitoring of the menstrual cycle and having intercourse only during times\nwhen the egg is not available. A woman\u2019s body temperature may rise a degree Celsius at ovulation and the cervical mucus\nmay increase in volume and become more pliable. These changes give a general indication of when intercourse is more or\nless likely to result in fertilization. Withdrawal involves the removal of the penis from the vagina during intercourse, before\nejaculation occurs. This is a risky method with a high failure rate due to the possible presence of sperm in the bulbourethral\ngland\u2019s secretion, which may enter the vagina prior to removing the penis.\nHormonal methods use synthetic progesterone (sometimes in combination with estrogen), to inhibit the hypothalamus from\nreleasing FSH or LH, and thus prevent an egg from being available for fertilization. The method of administering the\nhormone affects failure rate. The most reliable method, with a failure rate of less than 1 percent, is the implantation of the\nhormone under the skin. The same rate can be achieved through the sterilization procedures of vasectomy in the man or of\ntubal ligation in the woman, or by using an intrauterine device (IUD). IUDs are inserted into the uterus and establish an\ninflammatory condition that prevents fertilized eggs from implanting into the uterine wall.\n1522\nChapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nCompliance with the contraceptive method is a strong contributor to the success or failure rate of any particular method.\nThe only method that is completely effective at preventing conception is abstinence. The choice of contraceptive method\ndepends on the goals of the woman or couple. Tubal ligation and vasectomy are considered permanent prevention, while\nother methods are reversible and provide short-term contraception.\nTermination of an existing pregnancy can be spontaneous or voluntary. Spontaneous termination is a miscarriage and\nusually occurs very early in the pregnancy, usually within the first few weeks. This occurs when the fetus cannot develop\nproperly and the gestation is naturally terminated. Voluntary termination of a pregnancy is an abortion. Laws regulating\nabortion vary between states and tend to view fetal viability as the criteria for allowing or preventing the procedure.\nInfertility\nInfertility is the inability to conceive a child or carry a child to birth. About 75 percent of causes of infertility can be\nidentified; these include diseases, such as sexually transmitted diseases that can cause scarring of the reproductive tubes in\neither men or women, or developmental problems frequently related to abnormal hormone levels in one of the individuals.\nInadequate nutrition, especially starvation, can delay menstruation. Stress can also lead to infertility. Short-term stress can\naffect hormone levels, while long-term stress can delay puberty and cause less frequent menstrual cycles. Other factors that\naffect fertility include toxins (such as cadmium), tobacco smoking, marijuana use, gonadal injuries, and aging.\nIf infertility is identified, several assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are available to aid conception. A common\ntype of ART is in vitro fertilization (IVF) where an egg and sperm are combined outside the body and then placed in the\nuterus. Eggs are obtained from the woman after extensive hormonal treatments that prepare mature eggs for fertilization\nand prepare the uterus for implantation of the fertilized egg. Sperm are obtained from the man and they are combined with\nthe eggs and supported through several cell divisions to ensure viability of the zygotes. When the embryos have reached\nthe eight-cell stage, one or more is implanted into the woman\u2019s uterus. If fertilization is not accomplished by simple IVF,\na procedure that injects the sperm into an egg can be used. This is called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and is\nshown in Figure 34.32. IVF procedures produce a surplus of fertilized eggs and embryos that can be frozen and stored for\nfuture use.

        "summary": "Human pregnancy begins with fertilization, when a mature oocyte becomes a zygote that travels to the uterus and implants into the endometrium, supported by hormones such as \u03b2-HCG to maintain progesterone production. Gestation lasts about 266 days and is divided into three trimesters: in the first, the placenta forms and major organs and structures develop, making the fetus especially vulnerable to toxins; in the second, rapid growth and movement begin, the placenta fully sustains the fetus, and organ development continues; in the third, growth is most rapid, organs mature, and the mother experiences increased physical discomfort. Labor, triggered by hormonal feedback involving oxytocin and prostaglandins, occurs in three stages: dilation of the cervix, delivery of the baby, and expulsion of the placenta, with alternatives like Caesarean section available when necessary. Post-birth, lactation is stimulated by prolactin and oxytocin, providing nutrition and immune protection for the infant. Contraception methods\u2014barrier, hormonal, natural, withdrawal, sterilization, and IUDs\u2014vary in effectiveness, with abstinence as the only completely reliable method; termination of pregnancy can be spontaneous (miscarriage) or voluntary (abortion). Infertility, caused by factors like disease, hormonal issues, stress, toxins, or aging, can be addressed with assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection, which can improve chances of conception but may lead to multiple births."

Perhaps you are interested in learning about the natural world and how living things have adapted to\nthe physical conditions of their environment. Or, perhaps you\u2019re a future physician seeking to understand the connection\nbetween human health and ecology.\nHumans are a part of the ecological landscape, and human health is one important part of human interaction with our\nphysical and living environment. Lyme disease, for instance, serves as one modern-day example of the connection between\nour health and the natural world (Figure 35.1). More formally known as Lyme borreliosis, Lyme disease is a bacterial\ninfection that can be transmitted to humans when they are bitten by the deer tick (Ixodes scapularis), which is the primary\nvector for this disease. However, not all deer ticks carry the bacteria that will cause Lyme disease in humans, and I.\nscapularis can have other hosts besides deer. In fact, it turns out that the probability of infection depends on the type of host\nupon which the tick develops: a higher proportion of ticks that live on white-footed mice carry the bacterium than do ticks\nthat live on deer. Knowledge about the environments and population densities in which the host species is abundant would\nhelp a physician or an epidemiologist better understand how Lyme disease is transmitted and how its incidence could be\nreduced.\nFor example, the mild winter in the northeast during 2010\u20132011 caused a boom in acorns, which in turn caused an\nincrease in the white-footed mice population. However, the following winter was cooler, leading to fewer acorns, and\nthe subsequent decrease in the mice population means that the ticks will be more likely to seek out humans for their\nblood meals. You can read more about the relationship between acorns, mice, and Lyme disease at the Science Daily\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\n1539\nwebsite (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32lyme) and you can read more about Lyme disease from the CDC website\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32lymecdc) .\n35.1 | The Scope of Ecology\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat is ecology, and what are the four levels of ecological research?\n\u2022\nWhat are examples of the ways in which ecology requires the integration of different scientific disciplines?\n\u2022\nWhat are examples of biotic and abiotic components of the environment?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nEcology is the study of the interactions among living organisms and with their environment. This includes relationships\nbetween organisms of the same species and also between different species. One core goal of ecology is to understand the\ndistribution and abundance of organisms that inhabit the Earth. Ecology integrates multiple scientific disciplines in addition\nto biology, including molecular biology, physiology, evolution, biodiversity, geology, and climatology. Some ecological\nresearch also applies aspects of chemistry and physics, and it frequently uses mathematical models.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 4 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework. The AP\u00ae Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent\nfoundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP\u00ae exam\nquestions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.\nBig Idea 4\nBiological systems interact, and these systems and their interactions possess complex\nproperties.\nEnduring\nUnderstanding\n4.A\nInteractions within biological systems lead to complex properties.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n4.A.6 Interactions among living organisms and with their environment results in the\nmovement of matter and energy.\nScience\nPractice\n1.4 The student can use representations and models to analyze situations or solve problems\nqualitatively and quantitatively.\nLearning\nObjective\n4.15 The student is able to use visual representations to analyze situations or solve\nproblems qualitatively to illustrate how interactions among living systems and with their\nenvironment result in the movement of matter and energy.\n1540\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nClimate change can alter where organisms live, which can sometimes directly affect human health. Watch the PBS video\n\u201cFeeling the Effects of Climate Change\u201d (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/climate_health) in which researchers discover\na pathogenic organism living far outside of its normal range.\nThe fungus Cryptococcus gattii has been known to cause a fatal illness. This fungus originally found in the tropics is\nnow growing in parts of North America. What have scientists found out about this fungus?\na.\nThe fungus was inadvertently introduced in North America by travelers\nb.\nThis fungus acquired pathogenic characteristics over time.\nc.\nThe disease was caused by contact with infected people\nd.\nThe fungus started growing more in colder climates as temperatures have risen due to global warming.\nLevels of Ecological Study\nWhen a discipline such as biology is studied, it is often helpful to subdivide it into smaller, related areas. For instance, cell\nbiologists interested in cell signaling need to understand the chemistry of the signal molecules (which are usually proteins)\nas well as the result of cell signaling. Ecologists interested in the factors that influence the survival of an endangered species\nmight use mathematical models to predict how current conservation efforts affect endangered organisms. To produce a\nsound set of management options, a conservation biologist needs to collect accurate data, including current population size,\nfactors affecting reproduction (like physiology and behavior), habitat requirements (such as plants and soils), and potential\nhuman influences on the endangered population and its habitat (which might be derived through studies in sociology\nand urban ecology). Within the discipline of ecology, researchers work at four specific levels, sometimes discretely and\nsometimes with overlap: organism, population, community, and ecosystem (Figure 35.2).\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\n1541\nFigure 35.2 Ecologists study within several biological levels of organization. (credit \u201corganisms\u201d: modification of\nwork by \"Crystl\"/Flickr; credit \u201cecosystems\u201d: modification of work by Tom Carlisle, US Fish and Wildlife Service\nHeadquarters; credit \u201cbiosphere\u201d: NASA)\nOrganismal Ecology\nResearchers studying ecology at the organismal level are interested in the adaptations that enable individuals to live in\nspecific habitats. These adaptations can be morphological, physiological, and behavioral. For instance, the Karner blue\nbutterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) (Figure 35.3) is considered a specialist because the females preferentially oviposit\n(that is, lay eggs) on wild lupine. This preferential adaptation means that the Karner blue butterfly is highly dependent on\nthe presence of wild lupine plants for its continued survival.\nFigure 35.3 The Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) is a rare butterfly that lives only in open areas\nwith few trees or shrubs, such as pine barrens and oak savannas. It can only lay its eggs on lupine plants. (credit:\nmodification of work by J & K Hollingsworth, USFWS)\nAfter hatching, the larval caterpillars emerge and spend four to six weeks feeding solely on wild lupine (Figure 35.4). The\ncaterpillars pupate (undergo metamorphosis) and emerge as butterflies after about four weeks. The adult butterflies feed\non the nectar of flowers of wild lupine and other plant species. A researcher interested in studying Karner blue butterflies\nat the organismal level might, in addition to asking questions about egg laying, ask questions about the butterflies\u2019\npreferred temperature (a physiological question) or the behavior of the caterpillars when they are at different larval stages\n(a behavioral question).\n1542\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 35.4 The wild lupine (Lupinus perennis) is the host plant for the Karner blue butterfly.\nPopulation Ecology\nA population is a group of interbreeding organisms that are members of the same species living in the same area at the\nsame time. (Organisms that are all members of the same species are called conspecifics.) A population is identified, in\npart, by where it lives, and its area of population may have natural or artificial boundaries: natural boundaries might be\nrivers, mountains, or deserts, while examples of artificial boundaries include mowed grass, manmade structures, or roads.\nThe study of population ecology focuses on the number of individuals in an area and how and why population size changes\nover time. Population ecologists are particularly interested in counting the Karner blue butterfly, for example, because\nit is classified as federally endangered. However, the distribution and density of this species is highly influenced by the\ndistribution and abundance of wild lupine. Researchers might ask questions about the factors leading to the decline of\nwild lupine and how these affect Karner blue butterflies. For example, ecologists know that wild lupine thrives in open\nareas where trees and shrubs are largely absent. In natural settings, intermittent wildfires regularly remove trees and shrubs,\nhelping to maintain the open areas that wild lupine requires. Mathematical models can be used to understand how wildfire\nsuppression by humans has led to the decline of this important plant for the Karner blue butterfly.\nCommunity Ecology\nA biological community consists of the different species within an area, typically a three-dimensional space, and the\ninteractions within and among these species. Community ecologists are interested in the processes driving these interactions\nand their consequences. Questions about conspecific interactions often focus on competition among members of the same\nspecies for a limited resource. Ecologists also study interactions among various species; members of different species are\ncalled heterospecifics. Examples of heterospecific interactions include predation, parasitism, herbivory, competition, and\npollination. These interactions can have regulating effects on population sizes and can impact ecological and evolutionary\nprocesses affecting diversity.\nFor example, Karner blue butterfly larvae form mutualistic relationships with ants. Mutualism is a form of a long-\nterm relationship that has coevolved between two species and from which each species benefits. For mutualism to\nexist between individual organisms, each species must receive some benefit from the other as a consequence of the\nrelationship. Researchers have shown that there is an increase in the probability of survival when Karner blue butterfly\nlarvae (caterpillars) are tended by ants. This might be because the larvae spend less time in each life stage when tended\nby ants, which provides an advantage for the larvae. Meanwhile, the Karner blue butterfly larvae secrete a carbohydrate-\nrich substance that is an important energy source for the ants. Both the Karner blue larvae and the ants benefit from their\ninteraction.\nEcosystem Ecology\nEcosystem ecology is an extension of organismal, population, and community ecology. The ecosystem is composed of all\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\n1543\nthe biotic components (living things) in an area along with the abiotic components (non-living things) of that area. Some\nof the abiotic components include air, water, and soil. Ecosystem biologists ask questions about how nutrients and energy\nare stored and how they move among organisms and the surrounding atmosphere, soil, and water.\nThe Karner blue butterflies and the wild lupine live in an oak-pine barren habitat. This habitat is characterized by natural\ndisturbance and nutrient-poor soils that are low in nitrogen. The availability of nutrients is an important factor in the\ndistribution of the plants that live in this habitat. Researchers interested in ecosystem ecology could ask questions about the\nimportance of limited resources and the movement of resources, such as nutrients, though the biotic and abiotic portions of\nthe ecosystem.\nEcologist\nA career in ecology contributes to many facets of human society. Understanding ecological issues can help\nsociety meet the basic human needs of food, shelter, and health care. Ecologists can conduct their research\nin the laboratory and outside in natural environments (Figure 35.5). These natural environments can be as\nclose to home as the stream running through your campus or as far away as the hydrothermal vents at the\nbottom of the Pacific Ocean. Ecologists manage natural resources such as white-tailed deer populations\n(Odocoileus virginianus) for hunting or aspen (Populus spp.) timber stands for paper production. Ecologists\nalso work as educators who teach children and adults at various institutions including universities, high\nschools, museums, and nature centers. Ecologists may also work in advisory positions assisting local,\nstate, and federal policymakers to develop laws that are ecologically sound, or they may develop those\npolicies and legislation themselves. To become an ecologist requires an undergraduate degree, usually in a\nnatural science. The undergraduate degree is often followed by specialized training or an advanced degree,\ndepending on the area of ecology selected. Ecologists should also have a broad background in the physical\nsciences, as well as a sound foundation in mathematics and statistics.\nFigure 35.5 This landscape ecologist is releasing a black-footed ferret into its native habitat as part of a study.\n(credit: USFWS Mountain Prairie Region, NPS)\n1544\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nVisit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ecologist_role) to see Stephen Wing, a marine ecologist from the University\nof Otago, discuss the role of an ecologist and the types of issues ecologists explore.\nA marine ecologist studies interactions in the ocean.

It draws on multiple disciplines such as biology, chemistry, physics, geology, climatology, and mathematics, and can be studied at four levels: organismal (adaptations enabling survival in specific habitats), population (changes in population size and distribution), community (interactions among species, including competition, predation, and mutualism), and ecosystem (flow and storage of energy and nutrients among biotic and abiotic components). Examples include research on the endangered Karner blue butterfly, its dependence on wild lupine, and its mutualistic relationship with ants.

As these abiotic factors change,\nthe composition of plant and animal communities also changes. For example, if you were to begin a journey at the equator\nand walk north, you would notice gradual changes in plant communities. At the beginning of your journey, you would see\ntropical wet forests with broad-leaved evergreen trees, which are characteristic of plant communities found near the equator.\nAs you continued to travel north, you would see these broad-leaved evergreen plants eventually give rise to seasonally dry\nforests with scattered trees. You would also begin to notice changes in temperature and moisture. At about 30 degrees north,\nthese forests would give way to deserts, which are characterized by low precipitation.\nMoving farther north, you would see that deserts are replaced by grasslands or prairies. Eventually, grasslands are replaced\nby deciduous temperate forests. These deciduous forests give way to the boreal forests found in the subarctic, the area south\nof the Arctic Circle. Finally, you would reach the Arctic tundra, which is found at the most northern latitudes. This trek north\nreveals gradual changes in both climate and the types of organisms that have adapted to environmental factors associated\nwith ecosystems found at different latitudes. However, different ecosystems exist at the same latitude due in part to abiotic\nfactors such as jet streams, the Gulf Stream, and ocean currents. If you were to hike up a mountain, the changes you would\nsee in the vegetation would parallel those as you move to higher latitudes.\nEcologists who study biogeography examine patterns of species distribution. No species exists everywhere; for example,\nthe Venus flytrap is endemic to a small area in North and South Carolina. An endemic species is one which is naturally\nfound only in a specific geographic area that is usually restricted in size. Other species are generalists: species which live in\na wide variety of geographic areas; the raccoon, for example, is native to most of North and Central America.\nSpecies distribution patterns are based on biotic and abiotic factors and their influences during the very long periods of time\nrequired for species evolution; therefore, early studies of biogeography were closely linked to the emergence of evolutionary\nthinking in the eighteenth century. Some of the most distinctive assemblages of plants and animals occur in regions that\nhave been physically separated for millions of years by geographic barriers. Biologists estimate that Australia, for example,\nhas between 600,000 and 700,000 species of plants and animals. Approximately 3/4 of living plant and mammal species are\nendemic species found solely in Australia (Figure 35.6ab).\n1546\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 35.6 Australia is home to many endemic species.

(credit a: modification of work by Derrick Coetzee; credit b: modification of work by Allan Whittome)\nSometimes ecologists discover unique patterns of species distribution by determining where species are not found. Hawaii,\nfor example, has no native land species of reptiles or amphibians, and has only one native terrestrial mammal, the hoary bat.\nMost of New Guinea, as another example, lacks placental mammals.\nCheck out this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/platypus) to observe a platypus swimming in its natural habitat in\nNew South Wales, Australia.\nMarsupials such as such as wallabies, platypuses, and kangaroos are found exclusively in Australia.

Isolated land masses\u2014such as Australia, Hawaii, and Madagascar\u2014often have large numbers\nof endemic plant species. Some of these plants are endangered due to human activity. The forest gardenia (Gardenia\nbrighamii), for instance, is endemic to Hawaii; only an estimated 15\u201320 trees are thought to exist (Figure 35.7).\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\n1547\nThink About It\nMany endemic species are found in areas that are geographically isolated.

These organisms convert\nsolar energy into the chemical energy needed by all living things. Light availability can be an important force directly\naffecting the evolution of adaptations in photosynthesizers. For instance, plants in the understory of a temperate forest are\nshaded when the trees above them in the canopy completely leaf out in the late spring. Not surprisingly, understory plants\nhave adaptations to successfully capture available light. One such adaptation is the rapid growth of spring ephemeral plants\nsuch as the spring beauty (Figure 35.8). These spring flowers achieve much of their growth and finish their life cycle\n(reproduce) early in the season before the trees in the canopy develop leaves.\n1548\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 35.8 The spring beauty is an ephemeral spring plant that flowers early in the spring to avoid competing with\nlarger forest trees for sunlight. (credit: John Beetham)\nIn aquatic ecosystems, the availability of light may be limited because sunlight is absorbed by water, plants, suspended\nparticles, and resident microorganisms. Toward the bottom of a lake, pond, or ocean, there is a zone that light cannot\nreach. Photosynthesis cannot take place there and, as a result, a number of adaptations have evolved that enable living\nthings to survive without light. For instance, aquatic plants have photosynthetic tissue near the surface of the water; for\nexample, think of the broad, floating leaves of a water lily\u2014water lilies cannot survive without light. In environments such\nas hydrothermal vents, some bacteria extract energy from inorganic chemicals because there is no light for photosynthesis.\nThe availability of nutrients in aquatic systems is also an important aspect of energy or photosynthesis. Many organisms\nsink to the bottom of the ocean when they die in the open water; when this occurs, the energy found in that living organism\nis sequestered for some time unless ocean upwelling occurs. Ocean upwelling is the rising of deep ocean waters that\noccurs when prevailing winds blow along surface waters near a coastline (Figure 35.9). As the wind pushes ocean waters\noffshore, water from the bottom of the ocean moves up to replace this water. As a result, the nutrients once contained in\ndead organisms become available for reuse by other living organisms.\nFigure 35.9 Ocean upwelling is an important process that recycles nutrients and energy in the ocean. As wind (green\narrows) pushes offshore, it causes water from the ocean bottom (red arrows) to move to the surface, bringing up\nnutrients from the ocean depths.\nIn freshwater systems, the recycling of nutrients occurs in response to air temperature changes. The nutrients at the bottom\nof lakes are recycled twice each year: in the spring and fall turnover. The spring and fall turnover is a seasonal process that\nrecycles nutrients and oxygen from the bottom of a freshwater ecosystem to the top of a body of water (Figure 35.10). These\nturnovers are caused by the formation of a thermocline: a layer of water with a temperature that is significantly different\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\n1549\nfrom that of the surrounding layers. In wintertime, the surface of lakes found in many northern regions is frozen. However,\nthe water under the ice is slightly warmer, and the water at the bottom of the lake is warmer yet at 4 \u00b0C to 5 \u00b0C (39.2 \u00b0F to\n41 \u00b0F). Water is densest at 4 \u00b0C; therefore, the deepest water is also the densest. The deepest water is oxygen poor because\nthe decomposition of organic material at the bottom of the lake uses up available oxygen that cannot be replaced by means\nof oxygen diffusion into the water due to the surface ice layer.\nFigure 35.10 The spring and fall turnovers are important processes in freshwater lakes that act to move the\nnutrients and oxygen at the bottom of deep lakes to the top. Turnover occurs because water has a maximum\ndensity at 4 \u00b0C. Surface water temperature changes as the seasons progress, and denser water sinks.\nThe spring and fall turnovers are important processes in freshwater lakes that act to move nutrients and water from the\nbottom to the top. Explain how this is different in temperate regions as compared to the tropics.\na.\nSpring turnover occurs in tropical lakes, but not in temperate lakes. Stratification occurs in temperate lakes.\nb.\nTemperate lakes do not freeze so they do not undergo spring turnover or stratification.\nc.\nStratification and spring turnover occur in tropical lakes. Temperate lakes do not freeze so they do not\nundergo spring turnover.\nd.\nStratification and spring turnover occur in temperate lakes. Tropical lakes do not freeze so they do not\nundergo spring turnover.\nIn springtime, air temperatures increase and surface ice melts. When the temperature of the surface water begins to reach 4\n\u00b0C, the water becomes heavier and sinks to the bottom. The water at the bottom of the lake is then displaced by the heavier\nsurface water and, thus, rises to the top. As that water rises to the top, the sediments and nutrients from the lake bottom are\nbrought along with it. During the summer months, the lake water stratifies, or forms layers, with the warmest water at the\nlake surface.\nAs air temperatures drop in the fall, the temperature of the lake water cools to 4 \u00b0C; therefore, this causes fall turnover as the\nheavy cold water sinks and displaces the water at the bottom. The oxygen-rich water at the surface of the lake then moves\nto the bottom of the lake, while the nutrients at the bottom of the lake rise to the surface (Figure 35.10). During the winter,\nthe oxygen at the bottom of the lake is used by decomposers and other organisms requiring oxygen, such as fish.\nTemperature\nTemperature affects the physiology of living things as well as the density and state of water. Temperature exerts an\nimportant influence on living things because few living things can survive at temperatures below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) due to\nmetabolic constraints. It is also rare for living things to survive at temperatures exceeding 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F); this is a\nreflection of evolutionary response to typical temperatures. Enzymes are most efficient within a narrow and specific range\nof temperatures; enzyme degradation can occur at higher temperatures. Therefore, organisms either must maintain an\n1550\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\ninternal temperature or they must inhabit an environment that will keep the body within a temperature range that supports\nmetabolism. Some animals have adapted to enable their bodies to survive significant temperature fluctuations, such as seen\nin hibernation or reptilian torpor. Similarly, some bacteria are adapted to surviving in extremely hot temperatures such as\ngeysers. Such bacteria are examples of extremophiles: organisms that thrive in extreme environments.\nTemperature can limit the distribution of living things. Animals faced with temperature fluctuations may respond with\nadaptations, such as migration, in order to survive. Migration, the movement from one place to another, is an adaptation\nfound in many animals, including many that inhabit seasonally cold climates. Migration solves problems related to\ntemperature, locating food, and finding a mate. In migration, for instance, the Arctic Tern (Sterna paradisaea) makes a\n40,000 km (24,000 mi) round trip flight each year between its feeding grounds in the southern hemisphere and its breeding\ngrounds in the Arctic Ocean. Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) live in the eastern United States in the warmer months\nand migrate to Mexico and the southern United States in the wintertime. Some species of mammals also make migratory\nforays. Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) travel about 5,000 km (3,100 mi) each year to find food. Amphibians and reptiles\nare more limited in their distribution because they lack migratory ability. Not all animals that can migrate do so: migration\ncarries risk and comes at a high energy cost.\nSome animals hibernate or estivate to survive hostile temperatures. Hibernation enables animals to survive cold conditions,\nand estivation allows animals to survive the hostile conditions of a hot, dry climate. Animals that hibernate or estivate\nenter a state known as torpor: a condition in which their metabolic rate is significantly lowered. This enables the animal to\nwait until its environment better supports its survival. Some amphibians, such as the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), have an\nantifreeze-like chemical in their cells, which retains the cells\u2019 integrity and prevents them from bursting.\nWater\nWater is required by all living things because it is critical for cellular processes. Since terrestrial organisms lose water to the\nenvironment by simple diffusion, they have evolved many adaptations to retain water.\n\u2022\nPlants have a number of interesting features on their leaves, such as leaf hairs and a waxy cuticle, that serve to decrease\nthe rate of water loss via transpiration.\n\u2022\nFreshwater organisms are surrounded by water and are constantly in danger of having water rush into their cells\nbecause of osmosis. Many adaptations of organisms living in freshwater environments have evolved to ensure that\nsolute concentrations in their bodies remain within appropriate levels. One such adaptation is the excretion of dilute\nurine.\n\u2022\nMarine organisms are surrounded by water with a higher solute concentration than the organism and, thus, are in\ndanger of losing water to the environment because of osmosis. These organisms have morphological and physiological\nadaptations to retain water and release solutes into the environment. For example, Marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus\ncristatus), sneeze out water vapor that is high in salt in order to maintain solute concentrations within an acceptable\nrange while swimming in the ocean and eating marine plants.\nInorganic Nutrients and Soil\nInorganic nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are important in the distribution and the abundance of living things.\nPlants obtain these inorganic nutrients from the soil when water moves into the plant through the roots. Therefore, soil\nstructure (particle size of soil components), soil pH, and soil nutrient content play an important role in the distribution of\nplants. Animals obtain inorganic nutrients from the food they consume. Therefore, animal distributions are related to the\ndistribution of what they eat. In some cases, animals will follow their food resource as it moves through the environment.\nOther Aquatic Factors\nSome abiotic factors, such as oxygen, are important in aquatic ecosystems as well as terrestrial environments. Terrestrial\nanimals obtain oxygen from the air they breathe. Oxygen availability can be an issue for organisms living at very high\nelevations, however, where there are fewer molecules of oxygen in the air. In aquatic systems, the concentration of dissolved\noxygen is related to water temperature and the speed at which the water moves. Cold water has more dissolved oxygen than\nwarmer water. In addition, salinity, current, and tide can be important abiotic factors in aquatic ecosystems.\nOther Terrestrial Factors\nWind can be an important abiotic factor because it influences the rate of evaporation and transpiration. The physical force\nof wind is also important because it can move soil, water, or other abiotic factors, as well as an ecosystem\u2019s organisms.\nFire is another terrestrial factor that can be an important agent of disturbance in terrestrial ecosystems. Some organisms are\nadapted to fire and, thus, require the high heat associated with fire to complete a part of their life cycle. For example, the\njack pine\u2014a coniferous tree\u2014requires heat from fire for its seed cones to open (Figure 35.11). Through the burning of pine\nneedles, fire adds nitrogen to the soil and limits competition by destroying undergrowth.\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\n1551\nFigure 35.11 The mature cones of the jack pine (Pinus banksiana) open only when exposed to high temperatures,\nsuch as during a forest fire. A fire is likely to kill most vegetation, so a seedling that germinates after a fire is more likely\nto receive ample sunlight than one that germinates under normal conditions. (credit: USDA)\nAbiotic Factors Influencing Plant Growth\nTemperature and moisture are important influences on plant production (primary productivity) and the amount of organic\nmatter available as food (net primary productivity). Net primary productivity is an estimation of all of the organic\nmatter available as food; it is calculated as the total amount of carbon fixed per year minus the amount that is oxidized\nduring cellular respiration. In terrestrial environments, net primary productivity is estimated by measuring the aboveground\nbiomass per unit area, which is the total mass of living plants, excluding roots. This means that a large percentage of plant\nbiomass which exists underground is not included in this measurement. Net primary productivity is an important variable\nwhen considering differences in biomes. Very productive biomes have a high level of aboveground biomass.\nAnnual biomass production is directly related to the abiotic components of the environment. Environments with the greatest\namount of biomass have conditions in which photosynthesis, plant growth, and the resulting net primary productivity are\noptimized. The climate of these areas is warm and wet. Photosynthesis can proceed at a high rate, enzymes can work\nmost efficiently, and stomata can remain open without the risk of excessive transpiration; together, these factors lead to the\nmaximal amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) moving into the plant, resulting in high biomass production. The aboveground\nbiomass produces several important resources for other living things, including habitat and food. Conversely, dry and cold\nenvironments have lower photosynthetic rates and therefore less biomass. The animal communities living there will also be\naffected by the decrease in available food.\n35.3 | Terrestrial Biomes\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the two major abiotic factors that determine terrestrial biomes?\n\u2022\nWhat are distinguishing characteristics of each of the major terrestrial biomes?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nMuch of the information in this section is outside the scope of AP\u00ae.

        "summary": "Biogeography is the study of the geographic distribution of living organisms and the abiotic factors that influence their distribution, such as temperature, rainfall, elevation, and latitude. Changes in these factors lead to shifts in plant and animal communities, as seen when moving north from the equator or ascending a mountain. Species may be endemic, occurring naturally in only a specific, often isolated, area, or generalists with wide distributions. Historical geographic barriers play a major role in species distribution, with regions like Australia hosting many endemic species. Abiotic factors such as light availability, temperature, water, nutrients, oxygen, salinity, wind, and fire influence organism survival, adaptations, and ecosystem productivity. These factors also determine net primary productivity, with warm, wet environments supporting the highest biomass, while cold or dry environments have lower productivity and reduced food availability for animals."

This biome is found in equatorial regions (Figure 35.12).\nThe vegetation is characterized by plants with broad leaves that fall off throughout the year. Unlike the trees of deciduous\nforests, the trees in this biome do not have a seasonal loss of leaves associated with variations in temperature and sunlight;\nthese forests are \u201cevergreen\u201d year-round.\nThe temperature and sunlight profiles of tropical wet forests are very stable in comparison to that of other terrestrial biomes,\nwith the temperatures ranging from 20 \u00b0C to 34 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F to 93 \u00b0F). When one compares the annual temperature variation\nof tropical wet forests with that of other forest biomes, the lack of seasonal temperature variation in the tropical wet forest\nbecomes apparent. This lack of seasonality leads to year-round plant growth, rather than the seasonal (spring, summer, and\nfall) growth seen in other biomes. In contrast to other ecosystems, tropical ecosystems do not have long days and short\ndays during the yearly cycle. Instead, a constant daily amount of sunlight (11\u201312 hrs per day) provides more solar radiation,\nthereby, a longer period of time for plant growth.\nThe annual rainfall in tropical wet forests ranges from 125 to 660 cm (50\u2013200 in) with some monthly variation. While\nsunlight and temperature remain fairly consistent, annual rainfall is highly variable. Tropical wet forests have wet months in\nwhich there can be more than 30 cm (11\u201312 in) of precipitation, as well as dry months in which there are fewer than 10 cm\n(3.5 in) of rainfall. However, the driest month of a tropical wet forest still exceeds the annual rainfall of some other biomes,\nsuch as deserts.\nTropical wet forests have high net primary productivity because the annual temperatures and precipitation values in\nthese areas are ideal for plant growth. Therefore, the extensive biomass present in the tropical wet forest leads to plant\ncommunities with very high species diversities (Figure 35.13). Tropical wet forests have more species of trees than any\nother biome; on average between 100 and 300 species of trees are present in a single hectare (2.5 acres) of South America.\nOne way to visualize this is to compare the distinctive horizontal layers within the tropical wet forest biome. On the forest\nfloor is a sparse layer of plants and decaying plant matter. Above that is an understory of short shrubby foliage. A layer of\ntrees rises above this understory and is topped by a closed upper canopy\u2014the uppermost overhead layer of branches and\nleaves. Some additional trees emerge through this closed upper canopy. These layers provide diverse and complex habitats\nfor the variety of plants, fungi, animals, and other organisms within the tropical wet forests. For instance, epiphytes are\nplants that grow on other plants, which typically are not harmed. Epiphytes are found throughout tropical wet forest biomes.\nMany species of animals use the variety of plants and the complex structure of the tropical wet forests for food and shelter.\nSome organisms live several meters above ground and have adapted to this arboreal lifestyle.\nFigure 35.13 Tropical wet forests, such as these forests of Madre de Dios, Peru, near the Amazon River, have high\nspecies diversity. (credit: Roosevelt Garcia)\nSavannas\nSavannas are grasslands with scattered trees, and they are located in Africa, South America, and northern Australia (Figure\n35.12). Savannas are hot, tropical areas with temperatures averaging from 24 \u00b0C to 29 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F to 84 \u00b0F) and an annual\nrainfall of 10\u201340 cm (3.9\u201315.7 in). Savannas have an extensive dry season; for this reason, forest trees do not grow as\nwell as they do in the tropical wet forest (or other forest biomes). As a result, within the grasses and forbs (herbaceous\nflowering plants) that dominate the savanna, there are relatively few trees (Figure 35.14). Since fire is an important source\nof disturbance in this biome, plants have evolved well-developed root systems that allow them to quickly re-sprout after a\n1554\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nfire.\nFigure 35.14 Savannas, like this one in Taita Hills Wildlife Sanctuary in Kenya, are dominated by grasses. (credit:\nChristopher T. Cooper)\nSubtropical Deserts\nSubtropical deserts exist between 15 \u00b0 and 30 \u00b0 north and south latitude and are centered on the Tropics of Cancer and\nCapricorn (Figure 35.12). This biome is very dry; in some years, evaporation exceeds precipitation. Subtropical hot deserts\ncan have daytime soil surface temperatures above 60 \u00b0C (140 \u00b0F) and nighttime temperatures approaching 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). In\ncold deserts, temperatures can be as high as 25 \u00b0C and can drop below -30 \u00b0C (-22 \u00b0F). Subtropical deserts are characterized\nby low annual precipitation of fewer than 30 cm (12 in) with little monthly variation and lack of predictability in rainfall.\nIn some cases, the annual rainfall can be as low as 2 cm (0.8 in) in subtropical deserts located in central Australia (\u201cthe\nOutback\u201d) and northern Africa.\nThe vegetation and low animal diversity of this biome is closely related to this low and unpredictable precipitation. Very dry\ndeserts lack perennial vegetation that lives from one year to the next; instead, many plants are annuals that grow quickly and\nreproduce when rainfall does occur, then they die. Many other plants in these areas are characterized by having a number of\nadaptations that conserve water, such as deep roots, reduced foliage, and water-storing stems (Figure 35.15). Seed plants in\nthe desert produce seeds that can be in dormancy for extended periods between rains. Adaptations in desert animals include\nnocturnal behavior and burrowing.\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\n1555\nFigure 35.15 To reduce water loss, many desert plants have tiny leaves or no leaves at all. The leaves of ocotillo\n(Fouquieria splendens), shown here in the Sonora Desert near Gila Bend, Arizona, appear only after rainfall, and then\nare shed.\nChaparral\nThe chaparral is also called the scrub forest and is found in California, along the Mediterranean Sea, and along the southern\ncoast of Australia (Figure 35.12). The annual rainfall in this biome ranges from 65 cm to 75 cm (25.6\u201329.5 in), and the\nmajority of the rain falls in the winter. Summers are very dry and many chaparral plants are dormant during the summertime.\nThe chaparral vegetation, shown in Figure 35.16, is dominated by shrubs and is adapted to periodic fires, with some plants\nproducing seeds that only germinate after a hot fire. The ashes left behind after a fire are rich in nutrients like nitrogen that\nfertilize the soil and promote plant regrowth.\nFigure 35.16 The chaparral is dominated by shrubs. (credit: Miguel Vieira)\nTemperate Grasslands\nTemperate grasslands are found throughout central North America, where they are also known as prairies; they are also\nin Eurasia, where they are known as steppes (Figure 35.12). Temperate grasslands have pronounced annual fluctuations\n1556\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nin temperature with hot summers and cold winters. The annual temperature variation produces specific growing seasons\nfor plants. Plant growth is possible when temperatures are warm enough to sustain plant growth and when ample water is\navailable, which occurs in the spring, summer, and fall. During much of the winter, temperatures are low, and water, which\nis stored in the form of ice, is not available for plant growth.\nAnnual precipitation ranges from 25 cm to 75 cm (9.8\u201329.5 in). Because of relatively lower annual precipitation in\ntemperate grasslands, there are few trees except for those found growing along rivers or streams. The dominant vegetation\ntends to consist of grasses and some prairies sustain populations of grazing animals Figure 35.17. The vegetation is very\ndense and the soils are fertile because the subsurface of the soil is packed with the roots and rhizomes (underground stems)\nof these grasses. The roots and rhizomes act to anchor plants into the ground and replenish the organic material (humus) in\nthe soil when they die and decay.\nFigure 35.17 The American bison (Bison bison), more commonly called the buffalo, is a grazing mammal that once\npopulated American prairies in huge numbers. (credit: Jack Dykinga, USDA Agricultural Research Service)\nFires, mainly caused by lightning, are a natural disturbance in temperate grasslands. When fire is suppressed in temperate\ngrasslands, the vegetation eventually converts to scrub and dense forests. Often, the restoration or management of temperate\ngrasslands requires the use of controlled burns to suppress the growth of trees and maintain the grasses.\nTemperate Forests\nTemperate forests are the most common biome in eastern North America, Western Europe, Eastern Asia, Chile, and New\nZealand (Figure 35.12). This biome is found throughout mid-latitude regions. Temperatures range between -30 \u00b0C and 30\n\u00b0C (-22 \u00b0F to 86 \u00b0F) and drop to below freezing on an annual basis. These temperatures mean that temperate forests have\ndefined growing seasons during the spring, summer, and early fall. Precipitation is relatively constant throughout the year\nand ranges between 75 cm and 150 cm (29.5\u201359 in).\nBecause of the moderate annual rainfall and temperatures, deciduous trees are the dominant plant in this biome (Figure\n35.18). Deciduous trees lose their leaves each fall and remain leafless in the winter. Thus, no photosynthesis occurs in the\ndeciduous trees during the dormant winter period. Each spring, new leaves appear as the temperature increases. Because of\nthe dormant period, the net primary productivity of temperate forests is less than that of tropical wet forests. In addition,\ntemperate forests show less diversity of tree species than tropical wet forest biomes.\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\n1557\nFigure 35.18 Deciduous trees are the dominant plant in the temperate forest. (credit: Oliver Herold)\nThe trees of the temperate forests leaf out and shade much of the ground; however, this biome is more open than tropical\nwet forests because trees in the temperate forests do not grow as tall as the trees in tropical wet forests. The soils of the\ntemperate forests are rich in inorganic and organic nutrients. This is due to the thick layer of leaf litter on forest floors. As\nthis leaf litter decays, nutrients are returned to the soil. The leaf litter also protects soil from erosion, insulates the ground,\nand provides habitats for invertebrates (such as the pill bug or roly-poly, Armadillidium vulgare) and their predators, such\nas the red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus).\nBoreal Forests\nThe boreal forest, also known as taiga or coniferous forest, is found south of the Arctic Circle and across most of Canada,\nAlaska, Russia, and northern Europe (Figure 35.12). This biome has cold, dry winters and short, cool, wet summers. The\nannual precipitation is from 40 cm to 100 cm (15.7\u201339 in) and usually takes the form of snow. Little evaporation occurs\nbecause of the cold temperatures.\nThe long and cold winters in the boreal forest have led to the predominance of cold-tolerant cone-bearing plants. These\nare evergreen coniferous trees like pines, spruce, and fir, which retain their needle-shaped leaves year-round. Evergreen\ntrees can photosynthesize earlier in the spring than deciduous trees because less energy from the sun is required to warm a\nneedle-like leaf than a broad leaf. This benefits evergreen trees, which grow faster than deciduous trees in the boreal forest.\nIn addition, soils in boreal forest regions tend to be acidic with little available nitrogen. Leaves are a nitrogen-rich structure\nand deciduous trees must produce a new set of these nitrogen-rich structures each year. Therefore, coniferous trees that\nretain nitrogen-rich needles may have a competitive advantage over the broad-leafed deciduous trees.\nThe net primary productivity of boreal forests is lower than that of temperate forests and tropical wet forests. The\naboveground biomass of boreal forests is high because these slow-growing tree species are long lived and accumulate\nstanding biomass over time. Plant species diversity is less than that seen in temperate forests and tropical wet forests. Boreal\nforests lack the pronounced elements of the layered forest structure seen in tropical wet forests. The structure of a boreal\nforest is often only a tree layer and a ground layer (Figure 35.19). When conifer needles are dropped, they decompose more\nslowly than broad leaves; therefore, fewer nutrients are returned to the soil to fuel plant growth.\n1558\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 35.19 The boreal forest (taiga) has low lying plants and conifer trees. (credit: L.B. Brubaker)\nArctic Tundra\nThe Arctic tundra lies north of the subarctic boreal forest and is located throughout the Arctic regions of the northern\nhemisphere (Figure 35.12). The average winter temperature is -34 \u00b0C (-34 \u00b0F) and the average summer temperature is from\n3 \u00b0C to 12 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F\u201352 \u00b0F). Plants in the arctic tundra have a very short growing season of approximately 10\u201312 weeks.\nHowever, during this time, there are almost 24 hours of daylight and plant growth is rapid. The annual precipitation of the\nArctic tundra is very low with little annual variation in precipitation. And, as in the boreal forests, there is little evaporation\ndue to the cold temperatures.\nPlants in the Arctic tundra are generally low to the ground (Figure 35.20). There is little species diversity, low net primary\nproductivity, and low aboveground biomass. The soils of the Arctic tundra may remain in a perennially frozen state referred\nto as permafrost. The permafrost makes it impossible for roots to penetrate deep into the soil and slows the decay of organic\nmatter, which inhibits the release of nutrients from organic matter. During the growing season, the ground of the Arctic\ntundra can be completely covered with plants or lichens.\nFigure 35.20 Low-growing plants such as shrub willow dominate the tundra landscape, shown here in the Arctic\nNational Wildlife Refuge.

        "summary": "Terrestrial biomes are major land-based ecosystems defined primarily by temperature and precipitation, which determine vegetation type and, in turn, the animals present. Tropical wet forests, found near the equator, are warm, wet, and highly productive year-round, with diverse vegetation layered from the forest floor to the upper canopy. Savannas are tropical grasslands with scattered trees, warm temperatures, seasonal rainfall, and fire-adapted plants. Subtropical deserts, located around 15\u00b0\u201330\u00b0 latitude, have low, unpredictable rainfall, extreme temperatures, and plants and animals adapted to water conservation. The chaparral has mild, wet winters, hot, dry summers, shrub-dominated vegetation, and adaptations to periodic fires. Temperate grasslands, such as prairies and steppes, have hot summers, cold winters, moderate rainfall, fertile soils, and fire-maintained grasses. Temperate forests occur in mid-latitudes with year-round precipitation, four distinct seasons, dominant deciduous trees, and nutrient-rich soils. Boreal forests (taiga) consist mainly of cold-tolerant conifers, have long winters, short summers, acidic nutrient-poor soils, and lower biodiversity. Arctic tundra, north of the boreal forest, has extremely cold temperatures, low precipitation, short growing seasons, permafrost, low biodiversity, and vegetation close to the ground."

The aquatic medium\u2014water\u2014 has\ndifferent physical and chemical properties than air, however. Even if the water in a pond or other body of water is perfectly\nclear (there are no suspended particles), water, on its own, absorbs light. As one descends into a deep body of water,\nthere will eventually be a depth which the sunlight cannot reach. While there are some abiotic and biotic factors in a\nterrestrial ecosystem that might obscure light (like fog, dust, or insect swarms), usually these are not permanent features\nof the environment. The importance of light in aquatic biomes is central to the communities of organisms found in both\nfreshwater and marine ecosystems. In freshwater systems, stratification due to differences in density is perhaps the most\ncritical abiotic factor and is related to the energy aspects of light. The thermal properties of water (rates of heating and\ncooling) are significant to the function of marine systems and have major impacts on global climate and weather patterns.\nMarine systems are also influenced by large-scale physical water movements, such as currents; these are less important in\nmost freshwater lakes.\nThe ocean is categorized by several areas or zones (Figure 35.21). All of the ocean\u2019s open water is referred to as the pelagic\nrealm (or zone). The benthic realm (or zone) extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of\nthe ocean floor. Within the pelagic realm is the photic zone, which is the portion of the ocean that light can penetrate\n(approximately 200 m or 650 ft). At depths greater than 200 m, light cannot penetrate; thus, this is referred to as the aphotic\nzone. The majority of the ocean is aphotic and lacks sufficient light for photosynthesis. The deepest part of the ocean, the\nChallenger Deep (in the Mariana Trench, located in the western Pacific Ocean), is about 11,000 m (about 6.8 mi) deep. To\ngive some perspective on the depth of this trench, the ocean is, on average, 4267 m or 14,000 ft deep. These realms and\nzones are relevant to freshwater lakes as well.\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\n1561\nFigure 35.21 The ocean is divided into different zones based on water depth and distance from the shoreline.\nOcean waters receive varying amounts of sunlight based on the depth. Where would you expect to find the most\nphotosynthesis in an ocean biome?\na.\naphotic zone\nb.\nabyssal zone\nc.\nbenthic realm\nd.\nintertidal zone\nMarine Biomes\nThe ocean is the largest marine biome. It is a continuous body of salt water that is relatively uniform in chemical\ncomposition; it is a weak solution of mineral salts and decayed biological matter. Within the ocean, coral reefs are a second\nkind of marine biome. Estuaries, coastal areas where salt water and fresh water mix, form a third unique marine biome.\nOcean\nThe physical diversity of the ocean is a significant influence on plants, animals, and other organisms. The ocean is\ncategorized into different zones based on how far light reaches into the water. Each zone has a distinct group of species\nadapted to the biotic and abiotic conditions particular to that zone.\nThe intertidal zone, which is the zone between high and low tide, is the oceanic region that is closest to land (Figure\n35.21). Generally, most people think of this portion of the ocean as a sandy beach. In some cases, the intertidal zone is\nindeed a sandy beach, but it can also be rocky or muddy. The intertidal zone is an extremely variable environment because\nof tides. Organisms are exposed to air and sunlight at low tide and are underwater most of the time, especially during high\ntide. Therefore, living things that thrive in the intertidal zone are adapted to being dry for long periods of time. The shore\nof the intertidal zone is also repeatedly struck by waves, and the organisms found there are adapted to withstand damage\nfrom the pounding action of the waves (Figure 35.22). The exoskeletons of shoreline crustaceans (such as the shore crab,\nCarcinus maenas) are tough and protect them from desiccation (drying out) and wave damage. Another consequence of the\npounding waves is that few algae and plants establish themselves in the constantly moving rocks, sand, or mud.\n1562\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 35.22 Sea urchins, mussel shells, and starfish are often found in the intertidal zone, shown here in Kachemak\nBay, Alaska. (credit: NOAA)\nThe neritic zone (Figure 35.21) extends from the intertidal zone to depths of about 200 m (or 650 ft) at the edge of the\ncontinental shelf. Since light can penetrate this depth, photosynthesis can occur in the neritic zone. The water here contains\nsilt and is well-oxygenated, low in pressure, and stable in temperature. Phytoplankton and floating Sargassum (a type of\nfree-floating marine seaweed) provide a habitat for some sea life found in the neritic zone. Zooplankton, protists, small\nfishes, and shrimp are found in the neritic zone and are the base of the food chain for most of the world\u2019s fisheries.\nBeyond the neritic zone is the open ocean area known as the oceanic zone (Figure 35.21). Within the oceanic zone there is\nthermal stratification where warm and cold waters mix because of ocean currents. Abundant plankton serve as the base of\nthe food chain for larger animals such as whales and dolphins. Nutrients are scarce and this is a relatively less productive\npart of the marine biome. When photosynthetic organisms and the protists and animals that feed on them die, their bodies\nfall to the bottom of the ocean where they remain; unlike freshwater lakes, the open ocean lacks a process for bringing the\norganic nutrients back up to the surface. The majority of organisms in the aphotic zone include sea cucumbers (phylum\nEchinodermata) and other organisms that survive on the nutrients contained in the dead bodies of organisms in the photic\nzone.\nBeneath the pelagic zone is the benthic realm, the deepwater region beyond the continental shelf (Figure 35.21). The bottom\nof the benthic realm is comprised of sand, silt, and dead organisms. Temperature decreases, remaining above freezing, as\nwater depth increases. This is a nutrient-rich portion of the ocean because of the dead organisms that fall from the upper\nlayers of the ocean. Because of this high level of nutrients, a diversity of fungi, sponges, sea anemones, marine worms, sea\nstars, fishes, and bacteria exist.\nThe deepest part of the ocean is the abyssal zone, which is at depths of 4000 m or greater. The abyssal zone (Figure 35.21)\nis very cold and has very high pressure, high oxygen content, and low nutrient content. There are a variety of invertebrates\nand fishes found in this zone, but the abyssal zone does not have plants because of the lack of light. Hydrothermal vents are\nfound primarily in the abyssal zone; chemosynthetic bacteria utilize the hydrogen sulfide and other minerals emitted from\nthe vents. These chemosynthetic bacteria use the hydrogen sulfide as an energy source and serve as the base of the food\nchain found in the abyssal zone.\nCoral Reefs\nCoral reefs are ocean ridges formed by marine invertebrates living in warm shallow waters within the photic zone of the\nocean. They are found within 30\u02da north and south of the equator. The Great Barrier Reef is a well-known reef system\nlocated several miles off the northeastern coast of Australia. Other coral reef systems are fringing islands, which are directly\nadjacent to land, or atolls, which are circular reef systems surrounding a former landmass that is now underwater. The coral\norganisms (members of phylum Cnidaria) are colonies of saltwater polyps that secrete a calcium carbonate skeleton. These\ncalcium-rich skeletons slowly accumulate, forming the underwater reef (Figure 35.23). Corals found in shallower waters\n(at a depth of approximately 60 m or about 200 ft) have a mutualistic relationship with photosynthetic unicellular algae. The\nrelationship provides corals with the majority of the nutrition and the energy they require. The waters in which these corals\nlive are nutritionally poor and, without this mutualism, it would not be possible for large corals to grow. Some corals living\nin deeper and colder water do not have a mutualistic relationship with algae; these corals attain energy and nutrients using\nstinging cells on their tentacles to capture prey.\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\n1563\nWatch this National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/\nmarine_biology) to see marine ecologist Dr. Peter Etnoyer discusses his research on coral organisms.\nCorals are found in deep seas.

These fishes can feed on coral, the cryptofauna\n(invertebrates found within the calcium carbonate substrate of the coral reefs), or the seaweed and algae that are associated\nwith the coral. In addition, some fish species inhabit the boundaries of a coral reef; these species include predators,\nherbivores, or planktivores. Predators are animal species that hunt and are carnivores or \u201cflesh eaters.\u201d Herbivores eat plant\nmaterial, and planktivores eat plankton.\nFigure 35.23 Coral reefs are formed by the calcium carbonate skeletons of coral organisms, which are marine\ninvertebrates in the phylum Cnidaria.

The animals that create coral reefs have evolved over millions\nof years, continuing to slowly deposit the calcium carbonate that forms their characteristic ocean homes.\nBathed in warm tropical waters, the coral animals and their symbiotic algal partners evolved to survive at\nthe upper limit of ocean water temperature.\nTogether, climate change and human activity pose dual threats to the long-term survival of the world\u2019s\ncoral reefs. As global warming due to fossil fuel emissions raises ocean temperatures, coral reefs are\nsuffering. The excessive warmth causes the reefs to expel their symbiotic, food-producing algae, resulting\nin a phenomenon known as bleaching. When bleaching occurs, the reefs lose much of their characteristic\ncolor as the algae and the coral animals die if loss of the symbiotic zooxanthellae is prolonged.\nRising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide further threaten the corals in other ways; as CO2 dissolves\nin ocean waters, it lowers the pH and increases ocean acidity. As acidity increases, it interferes with the\ncalcification that normally occurs as coral animals build their calcium carbonate homes.\nWhen a coral reef begins to die, species diversity plummets as animals lose food and shelter. Coral reefs\nare also economically important tourist destinations, so the decline of coral reefs poses a serious threat to\ncoastal economies.\nHuman population growth has damaged corals in other ways, too. As human coastal populations increase,\nthe runoff of sediment and agricultural chemicals has increased, too, causing some of the once-clear tropical\nwaters to become cloudy. At the same time, overfishing of popular fish species has allowed the predator\nspecies that eat corals to go unchecked.\nAlthough a rise in global temperatures of 1\u20132\u02daC (a conservative scientific projection) in the coming decades\nmay not seem large, it is very significant to this biome. When change occurs rapidly, species can become\nextinct before evolution leads to new adaptations. Many scientists believe that global warming, with its rapid\n(in terms of evolutionary time) and inexorable increases in temperature, is tipping the balance beyond the\npoint at which many of the world\u2019s coral reefs can recover.\nWhat are the effects of global climate change and increasing levels of carbon dioxide on the coral reefs? How does it\naffect the local ecosystem?\na.\nDue to rising temperature, coral reefs lose their symbiotic partner, the algae, in the process called bleaching.\nRising CO2 changes the pH of water, which interferes with calcification. Animals whose source of food is\ncoral reefs also decline in numbers.\nb.\nDue to rising temperature the hard calcium carbonate skeleton of coral reefs is destroyed due to a process\ncalled bleaching.

Rising CO2 changes the pH\nof water through the process called bleaching. Animals whose source of food is coral reefs also decline in\nnumbers.\nEstuaries: Where the Ocean Meets Fresh Water\nEstuaries are biomes that occur where a source of fresh water, such as a river, meets the ocean. Therefore, both fresh water\nand salt water are found in the same vicinity; mixing results in a diluted (brackish) saltwater. Estuaries form protected areas\nwhere many of the young offspring of crustaceans, mollusks, and fish begin their lives. Salinity is a very important factor\nthat influences the organisms and the adaptations of the organisms found in estuaries. The salinity of estuaries varies and\nis based on the rate of flow of its freshwater sources. Once or twice a day, high tides bring salt water into the estuary. Low\ntides occurring at the same frequency reverse the current of salt water.\nThe short-term and rapid variation in salinity due to the mixing of fresh water and salt water is a difficult physiological\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\n1565\nchallenge for the plants and animals that inhabit estuaries. Many estuarine plant species are halophytes: plants that can\ntolerate salty conditions. Halophytic plants are adapted to deal with the salinity resulting from saltwater on their roots or\nfrom sea spray. In some halophytes, filters in the roots remove the salt from the water that the plant absorbs. Other plants are\nable to pump oxygen into their roots. Animals, such as mussels and clams (phylum Mollusca), have developed behavioral\nadaptations that expend a lot of energy to function in this rapidly changing environment. When these animals are exposed to\nlow salinity, they stop feeding, close their shells, and switch from aerobic respiration (in which they use gills) to anaerobic\nrespiration (a process that does not require oxygen). When high tide returns to the estuary, the salinity and oxygen content\nof the water increases, and these animals open their shells, begin feeding, and return to aerobic respiration.\nFigure 35.24 Estuaries are formed when marine water and fresh water meet. As a result, the water in estuaries\nvary widely in salinity. Organisms living in estuaries, such as the mangroves pictured here, must be able to tolerate\na wide variation of salinity.

Explain how this is different in temperate regions as compared to the tropics.\na.\nSpring turnover occurs in tropical lakes, but not in temperate lakes. Stratification occurs in temperate lakes.\nb.\nTemperate lakes do not freeze so they do not undergo spring turnover or stratification.\nc.\nStratification and spring turnover occur in tropical lakes. Temperate lakes do not freeze so they do not\nundergo spring turnover.\nd.\nStratification and spring turnover occur in temperate lakes. Tropical lakes do not freeze so they do not\nundergo spring turnover.\nFreshwater Biomes\nFreshwater biomes include lakes and ponds (standing water) as well as rivers and streams (flowing water). They also include\nwetlands, which will be discussed later. Humans rely on freshwater biomes to provide aquatic resources for drinking water,\ncrop irrigation, sanitation, and industry. These various roles and human benefits are referred to as ecosystem services. Lakes\nand ponds are found in terrestrial landscapes and are, therefore, connected with abiotic and biotic factors influencing these\nterrestrial biomes.\nLakes and Ponds\nLakes and ponds can range in area from a few square meters to thousands of square kilometers. Temperature is an important\nabiotic factor affecting living things found in lakes and ponds. In the summer, thermal stratification of lakes and ponds\noccurs when the upper layer of water is warmed by the sun and does not mix with deeper, cooler water. Light can\npenetrate within the photic zone of the lake or pond. Phytoplankton (algae and cyanobacteria) are found here and carry out\nphotosynthesis, providing the base of the food web of lakes and ponds. Zooplankton, such as rotifers and small crustaceans,\nconsume these phytoplankton. At the bottom of lakes and ponds, bacteria in the aphotic zone break down dead organisms\nthat sink to the bottom.\n1566\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nNitrogen and phosphorus are important limiting nutrients in lakes and ponds. Because of this, they are determining factors\nin the amount of phytoplankton growth in lakes and ponds. When there is a large input of nitrogen and phosphorus (from\nsewage and runoff from fertilized lawns and farms, for example), the growth of algae skyrockets, resulting in a large\naccumulation of algae called an algal bloom. Algal blooms (Figure 35.25) can become so extensive that they reduce light\npenetration in water. As a result, the lake or pond becomes aphotic and photosynthetic plants cannot survive. When the\nalgae die and decompose, severe oxygen depletion of the water occurs. Fishes and other organisms that require oxygen are\nthen more likely to die, and resulting dead zones are found across the globe. Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico represent\nfreshwater and marine habitats where phosphorus control and storm water runoff pose significant environmental challenges.\nFigure 35.25 The uncontrolled growth of algae in this lake has resulted in an algal bloom. (credit: Jeremy Nettleton)\nRivers and Streams\nRivers and streams are continuously moving bodies of water that carry large amounts of water from the source, or\nheadwater, to a lake or ocean. The largest rivers include the Nile River in Africa, the Amazon River in South America, and\nthe Mississippi River in North America.\nAbiotic features of rivers and streams vary along the length of the river or stream. Streams begin at a point of origin referred\nto as source water. The source water is usually cold, low in nutrients, and clear. The channel (the width of the river or\nstream) is narrower than at any other place along the length of the river or stream. Because of this, the current is often faster\nhere than at any other point of the river or stream.\nThe fast-moving water results in minimal silt accumulation at the bottom of the river or stream; therefore, the water is\nclear. Photosynthesis here is mostly attributed to algae that are growing on rocks; the swift current inhibits the growth of\nphytoplankton. An additional input of energy can come from leaves or other organic material that falls into the river or\nstream from trees and other plants that border the water. When the leaves decompose, the organic material and nutrients\nin the leaves are returned to the water. Plants and animals have adapted to this fast-moving water. For instance, leeches\n(phylum Annelida) have elongated bodies and suckers on both ends. These suckers attach to the substrate, keeping the leech\nanchored in place. Freshwater trout species (phylum Chordata) are an important predator in these fast-moving rivers and\nstreams.\nAs the river or stream flows away from the source, the width of the channel gradually widens and the current slows. This\nslow-moving water, caused by the gradient decrease and the volume increase as tributaries unite, has more sedimentation.\nPhytoplankton can also be suspended in slow-moving water. Therefore, the water will not be as clear as it is near the source.\nThe water is also warmer. Worms (phylum Annelida) and insects (phylum Arthropoda) can be found burrowing into the\nmud. The higher order predator vertebrates (phylum Chordata) include waterfowl, frogs, and fishes. These predators must\nfind food in these slow moving, sometimes murky, waters and, unlike the trout in the waters at the source, these vertebrates\nmay not be able to use vision as their primary sense to find food. Instead, they are more likely to use taste or chemical cues\nto find prey.\nWetlands\nWetlands are environments in which the soil is either permanently or periodically saturated with water. Wetlands are\ndifferent from lakes because wetlands are shallow bodies of water whereas lakes vary in depth. Emergent vegetation\nconsists of wetland plants that are rooted in the soil but have portions of leaves, stems, and flowers extending above the\nwater\u2019s surface. There are several types of wetlands including marshes, swamps, bogs, mudflats, and salt marshes (Figure\n35.26). The three shared characteristics among these types\u2014what makes them wetlands\u2014are their hydrology, hydrophytic\nvegetation, and hydric soils.\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\n1567\nFigure 35.26 Located in southern Florida, Everglades National Park is vast array of wetland environments, including\nsawgrass marshes, cypress swamps, and estuarine mangrove forests.

Bogs develop in depressions where water\nflow is low or nonexistent. Bogs usually occur in areas where there is a clay bottom with poor percolation. Percolation is\nthe movement of water through the pores in the soil or rocks.

        "summary": "Aquatic biomes are shaped by abiotic factors such as light, temperature, water movement, and nutrient availability, and are divided into marine and freshwater systems with distinct zones and communities. In marine biomes, the ocean is split into regions like the intertidal, neritic, oceanic, benthic, and abyssal zones, each with specialized organisms adapted to light availability, pressure, temperature, and nutrient levels. Coral reefs, formed by calcium carbonate\u2013secreting corals in warm photic waters, house high biodiversity but are threatened by climate change, ocean acidification, pollution, and overfishing. Estuaries, where freshwater meets seawater, have fluctuating salinity that challenges inhabitants, many of which have unique physiological or behavioral adaptations. Freshwater biomes include lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, and wetlands, each with varying nutrient levels, light penetration, and flow rates that influence resident species. Lakes and ponds often experience thermal stratification and seasonal nutrient cycling but can suffer from algal blooms caused by nutrient pollution. Rivers and streams change from clear, cold, fast-moving headwaters to slower, sediment-rich downstream areas, affecting species distribution and adaptations. Wetlands, saturated with water and dominated by hydrophytic plants, serve as nutrient filters and wildlife habitats, with bogs being nutrient-poor, acidic systems that often harbor carnivorous plants adapted to low nitrogen conditions."

However, a cold week in June is\na weather-related event and not a climate-related one. These misconceptions often arise because of confusion over the terms\nclimate and weather.\nClimate refers to the long-term, predictable atmospheric conditions of a specific area. The climate of a biome is\ncharacterized by having consistent temperature and annual rainfall ranges. Climate does not address the amount of rain that\nfell on one particular day in a biome or the colder-than-average temperatures that occurred on one day. In contrast, weather\nrefers to the conditions of the atmosphere during a short period of time. Weather forecasts are usually made for 48-hour\ncycles. Long-range weather forecasts are available but can be unreliable.\nTo better understand the difference between climate and weather, imagine that you are planning an outdoor event in northern\nWisconsin. You would be thinking about climate when you plan the event in the summer rather than the winter because\nyou have long-term knowledge that any given Saturday in the months of May to August would be a better choice for an\noutdoor event in Wisconsin than any given Saturday in January. However, you cannot determine the specific day that the\nevent should be held on because it is difficult to accurately predict the weather on a specific day. Climate can be considered\n\u201caverage\u201d weather.\nGlobal Climate Change\nClimate change can be understood by approaching three areas of study:\n\u2022\ncurrent and past global climate change\n\u2022\ncauses of past and present-day global climate change\n\u2022\nancient and current results of climate change\nIt is helpful to keep these three different aspects of climate change clearly separated when consuming media reports about\nglobal climate change. It is common for reports and discussions about global climate change to confuse the data showing\nthat Earth\u2019s climate is changing with the factors that drive this climate change.\nEvidence for Global Climate Change\nSince scientists cannot go back in time to directly measure climatic variables, such as average temperature and precipitation,\nthey must instead indirectly measure temperature. To do this, scientists rely on historical evidence of Earth\u2019s past climate.\nAntarctic ice cores are a key example of such evidence. These ice cores are samples of polar ice obtained by means of\ndrills that reach thousands of meters into ice sheets or high mountain glaciers. Viewing the ice cores is like traveling\nbackwards through time; the deeper the sample, the earlier the time period. Trapped within the ice are bubbles of air and\nother biological evidence that can reveal temperature and carbon dioxide data. Antarctic ice cores have been collected\nand analyzed to indirectly estimate the temperature of the Earth over the past 400,000 years (Figure 35.27a). The 0 \u00b0C\non this graph refers to the long-term average. Temperatures that are greater than 0 \u00b0C exceed Earth\u2019s long-term average\ntemperature. Conversely, temperatures that are less than 0 \u00b0C are less than Earth\u2019s average temperature. This figure shows\nthat there have been periodic cycles of increasing and decreasing temperature.\nBefore the late 1800s, the Earth has been as much as 9 \u00b0C cooler and about 3 \u00b0C warmer. Note that the graph in Figure\n35.27b shows that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has also risen and fallen in periodic cycles; note the\nrelationship between carbon dioxide concentration and temperature. Figure 35.27b shows that carbon dioxide levels in the\natmosphere have historically cycled between 180 and 300 parts per million (ppm) by volume.\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\n1569\nFigure 35.27 Ice at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica was laid down over the course 420,000 years and\nreached a depth of over 3,000 m. By measuring the amount of CO2 trapped in the ice, scientists have determined past\natmospheric CO2 concentrations. Temperatures relative to modern day were determined from the amount of deuterium\n(an isotope of hydrogen) present.\nFigure 35.27a does not show the last 2,000 years with enough detail to compare the changes of Earth\u2019s temperature during\nthe last 400,000 years with the temperature change that has occurred in the more recent past. Two significant temperature\nanomalies, or irregularities, have occurred in the last 2000 years. These are the Medieval Climate Anomaly (or the Medieval\nWarm Period) and the Little Ice Age. A third temperature anomaly aligns with the Industrial Era. The Medieval Climate\nAnomaly occurred between 900 and 1300 AD. During this time period, many climate scientists think that slightly warmer\nweather conditions prevailed in many parts of the world; the higher-than-average temperature changes varied between 0.10\n\u00b0C and 0.20 \u00b0C above the norm. Although 0.10 \u00b0C does not seem large enough to produce any noticeable change, it did free\nseas of ice. Because of this warming, the Vikings were able to colonize Greenland.\nThe Little Ice Age was a cold period that occurred between 1550 AD and 1850 AD. During this time, a slight cooling of\na little less than 1 \u00b0C was observed in North America, Europe, and possibly other areas of the Earth. This 1 \u00b0C change in\nglobal temperature is a seemingly small deviation in temperature (as was observed during the Medieval Climate Anomaly);\nhowever, it also resulted in noticeable changes. Historical accounts reveal a time of exceptionally harsh winters with much\nsnow and frost.\nThe Industrial Revolution, which began around 1750, was characterized by changes in much of human society. Advances\nin agriculture increased the food supply, which improved the standard of living for people in Europe and the United States.\nNew technologies were invented and provided jobs and cheaper goods. These new technologies were powered using fossil\nfuels, especially coal. The Industrial Revolution starting in the early nineteenth century ushered in the beginning of the\nIndustrial Era. When a fossil fuel is burned, carbon dioxide is released. With the beginning of the Industrial Era, atmospheric\ncarbon dioxide began to rise (Figure 35.28).\n1570\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 35.28 The atmospheric concentration of CO2 has risen steadily since the beginning of industrialization.\nCurrent and Past Drivers of Global Climate Change\nSince it is not possible to go back in time to directly observe and measure climate, scientists use indirect evidence to\ndetermine the drivers, or factors, that may be responsible for climate change. The indirect evidence includes data collected\nusing ice cores, boreholes (a narrow shaft bored into the ground), tree rings, glacier lengths, pollen remains, and ocean\nsediments. The data shows a correlation between the timing of temperature changes and drivers of climate change: before\nthe Industrial Era (pre-1780), there were three drivers of climate change that were not related to human activity or\natmospheric gases. The first of these is the Milankovitch cycles. The Milankovitch cycles describe the effects of slight\nchanges in the Earth\u2019s orbit on Earth\u2019s climate. The length of the Milankovitch cycles ranges between 19,000 and 100,000\nyears. In other words, one could expect to see some predictable changes in the Earth\u2019s climate associated with changes in\nthe Earth\u2019s orbit at a minimum of every 19,000 years.\nThe variation in the sun\u2019s intensity is the second natural factor responsible for climate change. Solar intensity is the amount\nof solar power or energy the sun emits in a given amount of time. There is a direct relationship between solar intensity and\ntemperature. As solar intensity increases (or decreases), the Earth\u2019s temperature correspondingly increases (or decreases).\nChanges in solar intensity have been proposed as one of several possible explanations for the Little Ice Age.\nFinally, volcanic eruptions are a third natural driver of climate change. Volcanic eruptions can last a few days, but the solids\nand gases released during an eruption can influence the climate over a period of a few years, causing short-term climate\nchanges. The gases and solids released by volcanic eruptions can include carbon dioxide, water vapor, sulfur dioxide,\nhydrogen sulfide, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide. Generally, volcanic eruptions cool the climate. This occurred in 1783\nwhen volcanos in Iceland erupted and caused the release of large volumes of sulfuric oxide. This led to haze-effect cooling,\na global phenomenon that occurs when dust, ash, or other suspended particles block out sunlight and trigger lower global\ntemperatures as a result; haze-effect cooling usually extends for one or more years. In Europe and North America, haze-\neffect cooling produced some of the lowest average winter temperatures on record in 1783 and 1784.\nGreenhouse gases are probably the most significant drivers of the climate. When heat energy from the sun strikes the Earth,\ngases known as greenhouse gases trap the heat in the atmosphere, as do the glass panes of a greenhouse keep heat from\nescaping. The greenhouse gases that affect Earth include carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, nitrous oxide, and ozone.\nApproximately half of the radiation from the sun passes through these gases in the atmosphere and strikes the Earth. This\nradiation is converted into thermal radiation on the Earth\u2019s surface, and then a portion of that energy is re-radiated back\ninto the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, however, reflect much of the thermal energy back to the Earth\u2019s surface. The more\ngreenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the more thermal energy is reflected back to the Earth\u2019s surface. Greenhouse\ngases absorb and emit radiation and are an important factor in the greenhouse effect: the warming of Earth due to carbon\ndioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nEvidence supports the relationship between atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and temperature: as carbon\ndioxide rises, global temperature rises. Since 1950, the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased from\nabout 280 ppm to 382 ppm in 2006. In 2011, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration was 392 ppm. However, the\nplanet would not be inhabitable by current life forms if water vapor did not produce its drastic greenhouse warming effect.\nScientists look at patterns in data and try to explain differences or deviations from these patterns. The atmospheric carbon\ndioxide data reveal a historical pattern of carbon dioxide increasing and decreasing, cycling between a low of 180 ppm and\na high of 300 ppm. Scientists have concluded that it took around 50,000 years for the atmospheric carbon dioxide level to\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\n1571\nincrease from its low minimum concentration to its higher maximum concentration. However, starting recently, atmospheric\ncarbon dioxide concentrations have increased beyond the historical maximum of 300 ppm. The current increases in\natmospheric carbon dioxide have happened very quickly\u2014in a matter of hundreds of years rather than thousands of years.\nWhat is the reason for this difference in the rate of change and the amount of increase in carbon dioxide? A key factor that\nmust be recognized when comparing the historical data and the current data is the presence of modern human society; no\nother driver of climate change has yielded changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels at this rate or to this magnitude.\nHuman activity releases carbon dioxide and methane, two of the most important greenhouse gases, into the atmosphere in\nseveral ways. The primary mechanism that releases carbon dioxide is the burning of fossil fuels, such as gasoline, coal, and\nnatural gas (Figure 35.29). Deforestation, cement manufacture, animal agriculture, the clearing of land, and the burning of\nforests are other human activities that release carbon dioxide. Methane (CH4) is produced when bacteria break down organic\nmatter under anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic conditions can happen when organic matter is trapped underwater (such as in\nrice paddies) or in the intestines of herbivores. Methane can also be released from natural gas fields and the decomposition\nthat occurs in landfills. Another source of methane is the melting of clathrates. Clathrates are frozen chunks of ice and\nmethane found at the bottom of the ocean. When water warms, these chunks of ice melt and methane is released. As the\nocean\u2019s water temperature increases, the rate at which clathrates melt is increasing, releasing even more methane. This leads\nto increased levels of methane in the atmosphere, which further accelerates the rate of global warming. This is an example\nof the positive feedback loop that is leading to the rapid rate of increase of global temperatures.\nFigure 35.29 The burning of fossil fuels in industry and by vehicles releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse\ngases into the atmosphere.

Modern-day phenomena such as\nretreating glaciers and melting polar ice cause a continual rise in sea level. Meanwhile, changes in climate can negatively\naffect organisms.\nGeological Climate Change\nGlobal warming has been associated with at least one planet-wide extinction event during the geological past. The Permian\nextinction event occurred about 251 million years ago toward the end of the roughly 50-million-year-long geological time\nspan known as the Permian period. This geologic time period was one of the three warmest periods in Earth\u2019s geologic\nhistory. Scientists estimate that approximately 70 percent of the terrestrial plant and animal species and 84 percent of marine\nspecies became extinct, vanishing forever near the end of the Permian period. Organisms that had adapted to wet and warm\nclimatic conditions, such as annual rainfall of 300\u2013400 cm (118\u2013157 in) and 20 \u00b0C\u201330 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F\u201386 \u00b0F) in the tropical wet\nforest, may not have been able to survive the Permian climate change.\n1572\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nWatch this NASA video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/climate_plants) to discover the mixed effects of global warming\non plant growth. While scientists found that warmer temperatures in the 1980s and 1990s caused an increase in plant\nproductivity, this advantage has since been counteracted by more frequent droughts.\nWhat impact does climate change have on plants?\na.\nWarmer temperatures extend the growing season of plants, which increases their water requirement\nthroughout the season.

Once\nthe growing season ends, milder and shorter winters fail to provide sufficient nutrients to plants increasing\nthe risk of plant death.\nPresent Climate Change\nA number of global events have occurred that may be attributed to climate change during our lifetimes. Glacier National\nPark in Montana is undergoing the retreat of many of its glaciers, a phenomenon known as glacier recession. In 1850, the\narea contained approximately 150 glaciers. By 2010, however, the park contained only about 24 glaciers greater than 25\nacres in size. One of these glaciers is the Grinnell Glacier (Figure 35.30) at Mount Gould. Between 1966 and 2005, the size\nof Grinnell Glacier shrank by 40 percent. Similarly, the mass of the ice sheets in Greenland and the Antarctic is decreasing:\nGreenland lost 150\u2013250 km3 of ice per year between 2002 and 2006. In addition, the size and thickness of the Arctic sea ice\nis decreasing.\nFigure 35.30 The effect of global warming can be seen in the continuing retreat of Grinnel Glacier. The mean annual\ntemperature in the park has increased 1.33 \u00b0C since 1900. The loss of a glacier results in the loss of summer\nmeltwaters, sharply reducing seasonal water supplies and severely affecting local ecosystems. (credit: modification of\nwork by USGS)\nThis loss of ice is leading to increases in the global sea level. On average, the sea is rising at a rate of 1.8 mm per year.\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\n1573\nHowever, between 1993 and 2010 the rate of sea level increase ranged between 2.9 and 3.4 mm per year. A variety of\nfactors affect the volume of water in the ocean, including the temperature of the water (the density of water is related to its\ntemperature) and the amount of water found in rivers, lakes, glaciers, polar ice caps, and sea ice. As glaciers and polar ice\ncaps melt, there is a significant contribution of liquid water that was previously frozen.\nIn addition to some abiotic conditions changing in response to climate change, many organisms are also being affected by\nthe changes in temperature. Temperature and precipitation play key roles in determining the geographic distribution and\nphenology of plants and animals. (Phenology is the study of the effects of climatic conditions on the timing of periodic\nlifecycle events, such as flowering in plants or migration in birds.) Researchers have shown that 385 plant species in Great\nBritain are flowering 4.5 days sooner than was recorded earlier during the previous 40 years. In addition, insect-pollinated\nspecies were more likely to flower earlier than wind-pollinated species. The impact of changes in flowering date would be\nmitigated if the insect pollinators emerged earlier. This mismatched timing of plants and pollinators could result in injurious\necosystem effects because, for continued survival, insect-pollinated plants must flower when their pollinators are present.\nThink About It\nWhat are possible short-term and long-term effects of natural and human-induced processes on global climate change\nand, consequently, ecosystems?\n1574\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nabiotic\naboveground biomass\nabyssal zone\nalgal bloom\naphotic zone\nbenthic realm\nbiogeography\nbiome\nbiotic\ncanopy\nchannel\nclathrates\nclimate\nconspecifics\ncoral reef\ncryptofauna\necology\necosystem services\nemergent vegetation\nendemic\nestuary\nfall and spring turnover\nglobal climate change\ngreenhouse effect\ngreenhouse gases\nhaze-effect cooling\nheterospecifics\nintertidal zone\nKEY TERMS\nnonliving components of the environment\ntotal mass of aboveground living plants per area\ndeepest part of the ocean at depths of 4000 m or greater\nrapid increase of algae in an aquatic system\npart of the ocean where no light penetrates\n(also, benthic zone) part of the ocean that extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest\nparts of the ocean floor\nstudy of the geographic distribution of living things and the abiotic factors that affect their distribution\necological community of plants, animals, and other organisms that is adapted to a characteristic set of\nenvironmental conditions\nliving components of the environment\nbranches and foliage of trees that form a layer of overhead coverage in a forest\nwidth of a river or stream from one bank to the other bank\nfrozen chunks of ice and methane found at the bottom of the ocean\nlong-term, predictable atmospheric conditions present in a specific area\nindividuals that are members of the same species\nocean ridges formed by marine invertebrates living in warm, shallow waters within the photic zone\ninvertebrates found within the calcium carbonate substrate of coral reefs\nstudy of interaction between living things and their environment\nhuman benefits and services provided by natural ecosystems\nwetland plants that are rooted in the soil but have portions of leaves, stems, and flowers extending\nabove the water\u2019s surface\nspecies found only in a specific geographic area that is usually restricted in size\nbiomes where a source of fresh water, such as a river, meets the ocean\nseasonal process that recycles nutrients and oxygen from the bottom of a freshwater ecosystem\nto the top\naltered global weather patterns, including a worldwide increase in temperature, due largely to\nrising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide\nwarming of Earth due to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere\natmospheric gases such as carbon dioxide and methane that absorb and emit radiation, thus trapping\nheat in Earth\u2019s atmosphere\neffect of the gases and solids from a volcanic eruption on global climate\nindividuals that are members of different species\npart of the ocean that is closest to land; parts extend above the water at low tide\nChapter 35 | Ecology and the Biosphere\n1575\nMilankovitch cycles\nneritic zone\nnet primary productivity\nocean upwelling\noceanic zone\npelagic realm\npermafrost\nphotic zone\nplanktivore\npredator\nSargassum\nsolar intensity\nsource water\nthermocline\nweather\ncyclic changes in the Earth's orbit that may affect climate\npart of the ocean that extends from low tide to the edge of the continental shelf\nmeasurement of the energy accumulation within an ecosystem, calculated as the total amount\nof carbon fixed per year minus the amount that is oxidized during cellular respiration\nrising of deep ocean waters that occurs when prevailing winds blow along surface waters near a\ncoastline\npart of the ocean that begins offshore where the water measures 200 m deep or deeper\n(also, pelagic zone) open ocean waters that are not close to the bottom or near the shore\nperennially frozen portion of the Arctic tundra soil\nportion of the ocean that light can penetrate\nanimal species that eats plankton\nanimal species that hunt and are carnivores or \u201cflesh eaters\u201d\ntype of free-floating marine seaweed\namount of solar power energy the sun emits in a given amount of time\npoint of origin of a river or stream\nlayer of water with a temperature that is significantly different from that of the surrounding layers\nconditions of the atmosphere during a short period of time",
        "summary": "Global climate change refers to long-term shifts in global weather patterns, primarily driven in recent times by rising atmospheric carbon dioxide from human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. Climate, which describes predictable long-term atmospheric conditions, differs from short-term weather events. Evidence from Antarctic ice cores, geological records, and other indirect measures shows historical cycles of temperature and CO\u2082 fluctuations, influenced naturally by Milankovitch cycles, solar intensity, and volcanic activity. Today\u2019s unprecedented rapid increases in greenhouse gases\u2014especially CO\u2082 and methane\u2014are linked to human actions and are intensifying the greenhouse effect, trapping more heat in the atmosphere. Documented impacts include retreating glaciers, melting polar ice, rising sea levels, shifts in plant flowering times, and disruptions to species interactions. Past climate changes, such as the Permian extinction, illustrate how warming can cause mass species loss, and current changes are already altering ecosystems and threatening biodiversity."

This is a risk now on many\nrivers and canal systems in Illinois and Missouri because of the presence of Asian carp.\nThis fish\u2014actually a group of species including the silver, black, grass, and big head carp\u2014has been farmed and eaten\nin China for over 1000 years. It is one of the most important aquaculture food resources worldwide. In the United States,\nhowever, Asian carp is considered a dangerous invasive species that disrupts community structure and composition to the\npoint of threatening native species.\nThe Asian carp is now threatening to invade the Great Lakes. You can read more about this invasion here\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32asiancarp) .\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1593\n36.1 | Population Demography\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nHow do ecologists measure population size and density?\n\u2022\nWhat are three different patterns of population distribution?\n\u2022\nHow can life tables be used to calculate mortality rates?\n\u2022\nWhat are the three types of survivorship curves and how do they relate to specific populations?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nBy using mathematics, ecologists can study how interactions among living organisms and with their environment affect\nthe distribution, abundance, density, and life strategies of species. A population consists of individuals of the same species\nliving within a specific area. Populations fluctuate based on both biotic and abiotic factors. When studying a population,\ncharacteristics of that population are quantified and their change is monitored. This statistical study of these changes,\ndemography, investigates how populations respond to these fluctuations. A shift in populations can affect community\nstructure and the ecosystem as a whole.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 and Big Idea 4\nof the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework.

Populations consist all of the species living within a specific area, and populations\nfluctuate based on a number of factors: seasonal and yearly changes in the environment, natural disasters such as forest\nfires and volcanic eruptions, and competition for resources between and within species. The statistical study of population\ndynamics, demography, uses a series of mathematical tools to investigate how populations respond to changes in their\nbiotic and abiotic environments. Many of these tools were originally designed to study human populations. For example,\nlife tables, which detail the life expectancy of individuals within a population, were initially developed by life insurance\ncompanies to set insurance rates. In fact, while the term \u201cdemographics\u201d is commonly used when discussing humans, all\nliving populations can be studied using this approach.\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1595\nPopulation Size and Density\nThe study of any population usually begins by determining how many individuals of a particular species exist, and how\nclosely associated they are with each other. Within a particular habitat, a population can be characterized by its population\nsize (N), the total number of individuals, and its population density, the number of individuals within a specific area or\nvolume. Population size and density are the two main characteristics used to describe and understand populations. For\nexample, populations with more individuals may be more stable than smaller populations based on their genetic variability,\nand thus their potential to adapt to the environment. Alternatively, a member of a population with low population density\n(more spread out in the habitat), might have more difficulty finding a mate to reproduce compared to a population of higher\ndensity. As is shown in Figure 36.2, smaller organisms tend to be more densely distributed than larger organisms.\nFigure 36.2 Australian mammals show a typical inverse relationship between population density and body size.\nPopulation Research Methods\nThe most accurate way to determine population size is to simply count all of the individuals within the habitat. However, this\nmethod is often not logistically or economically feasible, especially when studying large habitats. Thus, scientists usually\nstudy populations by sampling a representative portion of each habitat and using this data to make inferences about the\nhabitat as a whole. A variety of methods can be used to sample populations to determine their size and density. For immobile\norganisms such as plants, or for very small and slow-moving organisms, a quadrat may be used (Figure 36.3). A quadrat\nis a way of marking off square areas within a habitat, either by staking out an area with sticks and string, or by the use\nof a wood, plastic, or metal square placed on the ground. After setting the quadrats, researchers then count the number\nof individuals that lie within their boundaries. Multiple quadrat samples are performed throughout the habitat at several\nrandom locations. All of this data can then be used to estimate the population size and population density within the entire\nhabitat. The number and size of quadrat samples depends on the type of organisms under study and other factors, including\nthe density of the organism. For example, if sampling daffodils, a 1 m2 quadrat might be used whereas with giant redwoods,\nwhich are larger and live much further apart from each other, a larger quadrat of 100 m2 might be employed. This ensures\nthat enough individuals of the species are counted to get an accurate sample that correlates with the habitat, including areas\nnot sampled.\n1596\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 36.3 A scientist uses a quadrat to measure population size and density. (credit: NPS Sonoran Desert Network)\nFor mobile organisms, such as mammals, birds, or fish, a technique called mark and recapture is often used. This method\ninvolves marking a sample of captured animals in some way (such as tags, bands, paint, or other body markings), and\nthen releasing them back into the environment to allow them to mix with the rest of the population; later, a new sample is\ncollected, including some individuals that are marked (recaptures) and some individuals that are unmarked (Figure 36.4).\nFigure 36.4 Mark and recapture is used to measure the population size of mobile animals such as (a) bighorn sheep,\n(b) the California condor, and (c) salmon. (credit a: modification of work by Neal Herbert, NPS; credit b: modification of\nwork by Pacific Southwest Region USFWS; credit c: modification of work by Ingrid Taylar)\nUsing the ratio of marked and unmarked individuals, scientists determine how many individuals are in the sample. From\nthis, calculations are used to estimate the total population size. This method assumes that the larger the population, the lower\nthe percentage of tagged organisms that will be recaptured since they will have mixed with more untagged individuals. For\nexample, if 80 deer are captured, tagged, and released into the forest, and later 100 deer are captured and 20 of them are\nalready marked, we can determine the population size (N) using the following equation:\n(number marked fir t catch x total number of second catch)\nnumber marked second catch\n = N\nUsing our example, the population size would be estimated at 400.\n(80 x 100)\n20\n = 400\nTherefore, there are an estimated 400 total individuals in the original population.\nThere are some limitations to the mark and recapture method. Some animals from the first catch may learn to avoid capture\nin the second round, thus inflating population estimates. Alternatively, animals may preferentially be retrapped (especially\nif a food reward is offered), resulting in an underestimate of population size. Also, some species may be harmed by the\nmarking technique, reducing their survival. A variety of other techniques have been developed, including the electronic\ntracking of animals tagged with radio transmitters and the use of data from commercial fishing and trapping operations to\nestimate the size and health of populations and communities.\nSpecies Distribution\nIn addition to measuring simple density, further information about a population can be obtained by looking at the\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1597\ndistribution of the individuals. Species dispersion patterns (or distribution patterns) show the spatial relationship between\nmembers of a population within a habitat at a particular point in time. In other words, they show whether members of the\nspecies live close together or far apart, and what patterns are evident when they are spaced apart.\nIndividuals in a population can be more or less equally spaced apart, dispersed randomly with no predictable pattern, or\nclustered in groups. These are known as uniform, random, and clumped dispersion patterns, respectively (Figure 36.5).\nUniform dispersion is observed in plants that secrete substances inhibiting the growth of nearby individuals (such as the\nrelease of toxic chemicals by the sage plant Salvia leucophylla, a phenomenon called allelopathy) and in animals like the\npenguin that maintain a defined territory. An example of random dispersion occurs with dandelion and other plants that\nhave wind-dispersed seeds that germinate wherever they happen to fall in a favorable environment. A clumped dispersion\nmay be seen in plants that drop their seeds straight to the ground, such as oak trees, or animals that live in groups (schools\nof fish or herds of elephants). Clumped dispersions may also be a function of habitat heterogeneity. Thus, the dispersion\nof the individuals within a population provides more information about how they interact with each other than does a\nsimple density measurement. Just as lower density species might have more difficulty finding a mate, solitary species with\na random distribution might have a similar difficulty when compared to social species clumped together in groups.\nFigure 36.5 Species may have uniform, random, or clumped distribution. Territorial birds such as penguins tend\nto have uniform distribution. Plants such as dandelions with wind-dispersed seeds tend to be randomly distributed.\nAnimals such as elephants that travel in groups exhibit clumped distribution. (credit a: modification of work by Ben\nTubby; credit b: modification of work by Rosendahl; credit c: modification of work by Rebecca Wood)\nDemography\nWhile population size and density describe a population at one particular point in time, scientists must use demography to\nstudy the dynamics of a population. Demography is the statistical study of population changes over time: birth rates, death\nrates, and life expectancies. Each of these measures, especially birth rates, may be affected by the population characteristics\ndescribed above. For example, a large population size results in a higher birth rate because more potentially reproductive\nindividuals are present. In contrast, a large population size can also result in a higher death rate because of competition,\ndisease, and the accumulation of waste. Similarly, a higher population density or a clumped dispersion pattern results in\nmore potential reproductive encounters between individuals, which can increase birth rate. Lastly, a female-biased sex ratio\n(the ratio of males to females) or age structure (the proportion of population members at specific age ranges) composed of\nmany individuals of reproductive age can increase birth rates.\nIn addition, the demographic characteristics of a population can influence how the population grows or declines over time.\nIf birth and death rates are equal, the population remains stable. However, the population size will increase if birth rates\nexceed death rates; the population will decrease if birth rates are less than death rates. Life expectancy is another important\nfactor; the length of time individuals remain in the population impacts local resources, reproduction, and the overall health\nof the population. These demographic characteristics are often displayed in the form of a life table.\nLife Tables\nLife tables provide important information about the life history of an organism. Life tables divide the population into age\ngroups and often sexes, and show how long a member of that group is likely to live. They are modeled after actuarial tables\nused by the insurance industry for estimating human life expectancy. Life tables may include the probability of individuals\ndying before their next birthday (i.e., their mortality rate), the percentage of surviving individuals dying at a particular age\ninterval, and their life expectancy at each interval. An example of a life table is shown in Table 36.1 from a study of Dall\nmountain sheep, a species native to northwestern North America. Notice that the population is divided into age intervals\n(column A). The mortality rate (per 1000), shown in column D, is based on the number of individuals dying during the age\n1598\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\ninterval (column B) divided by the number of individuals surviving at the beginning of the interval (Column C), multiplied\nby 1000.\nmortality rate = number of individuals dying\nnumber of individuals surviving x 1000\nFor example, between ages three and four, 12 individuals die out of the 776 that were remaining from the original 1000\nsheep. This number is then multiplied by 1000 to get the mortality rate per thousand.\nmortality rate = 12\n776 x 1000 \u2248 15.5\nAs can be seen from the mortality rate data (column D), a high death rate occurred when the sheep were between 6 and 12\nmonths old, and then increased even more from 8 to 12 years old, after which there were few survivors. The data indicate\nthat if a sheep in this population were to survive to age one, it could be expected to live another 7.7 years on average, as\nshown by the life expectancy numbers in column E.\nLife Table of Dall Mountain Sheep\n[1]\nAge\ninterval\n(years)\nNumber\ndying in age\ninterval out\nof 1000 born\nNumber surviving\nat beginning of\nage interval out of\n1000 born\nMortality rate\nper 1000 alive\nat beginning of\nage interval\nLife expectancy or\nmean lifetime\nremaining to those\nattaining age interval\n0-0.5\n54\n1000\n54.0\n7.06\n0.5-1\n145\n946\n153.3\n--\n1-2\n12\n801\n15.0\n7.7\n2-3\n13\n789\n16.5\n6.8\n3-4\n12\n776\n15.5\n5.9\n4-5\n30\n764\n39.3\n5.0\n5-6\n46\n734\n62.7\n4.2\n6-7\n48\n688\n69.8\n3.4\n7-8\n69\n640\n107.8\n2.6\n8-9\n132\n571\n231.2\n1.9\n9-10\n187\n439\n426.0\n1.3\n10-11\n156\n252\n619.0\n0.9\n11-12\n90\n96\n937.5\n0.6\n12-13\n3\n6\n500.0\n1.2\n13-14\n3\n3\n1000\n0.7\nTable 36.1 This life table of Ovis dalli shows the number of deaths, number of survivors, mortality rate,\nand life expectancy at each age interval for the Dall mountain sheep.\nSurvivorship Curves\nAnother tool used by population ecologists is a survivorship curve, which is a graph of the number of individuals surviving\nat each age interval plotted versus time (usually with data compiled from a life table). These curves allow us to compare the\nlife histories of different populations (Figure 36.6). Humans and most primates exhibit a Type I survivorship curve because\na high percentage of offspring survive their early and middle years\u2014death occurs predominantly in older individuals. These\ntypes of species usually have small numbers of offspring at one time, and they give a high amount of parental care to them\nto ensure their survival. Birds are an example of an intermediate or Type II survivorship curve because birds die more or\n1. Data Adapted from Edward S.

These organisms also may have relatively few offspring and provide significant parental\ncare. Trees, marine invertebrates, and most fishes exhibit a Type III survivorship curve because very few of these organisms\nsurvive their younger years; however, those that make it to an old age are more likely to survive for a relatively long period\nof time. Organisms in this category usually have a very large number of offspring, but once they are born, little parental\ncare is provided. Thus these offspring are \u201con their own\u201d and vulnerable to predation, but their sheer numbers assure the\nsurvival of enough individuals to perpetuate the species.\nFigure 36.6 Survivorship curves show the distribution of individuals in a population according to age. Humans and\nmost mammals have a Type I survivorship curve because death primarily occurs in the older years. Birds have a Type\nII survivorship curve, as death at any age is equally probable.

        "summary": "Population demography is the statistical study of populations, focusing on characteristics such as size, density, distribution, age structure, and sex ratio, and how these change over time in response to biotic and abiotic factors. Population size (total individuals) and density (individuals per area or volume) are key descriptors, measured through direct counts, sampling methods like quadrats for immobile species, and mark-recapture techniques for mobile species. Distribution patterns may be uniform, random, or clumped, reflecting social behavior, reproductive strategies, or environmental conditions. Demographic data, including birth rates, death rates, and life expectancy, are often organized in life tables, which divide populations into age and sex classes to reveal mortality rates and expected lifespans. Survivorship curves (Type I, II, III) derived from life tables depict survival patterns across lifespans, illustrating strategies ranging from high parental care with late-life mortality to high early mortality with minimal care but numerous offspring. Together, these tools help ecologists understand population dynamics and predict changes over time."

As we learned in\n1600\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nearlier chapters, changes in free energy availability can cause fluctuations in population. All species have an energy budget\nand must balance energy intake with their use of energy for metabolism, parental care, and energy storage.\nIt\u2019s amazing how much free energy is required for reproduction and the subsequent care of offspring. Fecundity describes\nhow many offspring could be produced if an individual has as many offspring as possible. In animals, fecundity is inversely\nproportional to the amount of care given to an individual offspring.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 1 and Big Idea 2\nof the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP\u00ae Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide\na transparent foundation for the AP\u00ae Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and\nAP\u00ae exam questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.\nBig Idea 1\nThe process of evolution drives the diversity and unity of life.\nEnduring\nUnderstanding\n1.A\nChange in the genetic makeup of a population over time is evolution.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n1.A.2 Natural selection acts on phenotypic variations in populations.\nScience\nPractice\n2.2 The student can apply mathematical routines to quantities that describe natural\nphenomena.\nScience\nPractice\n5.3 The student can evaluate the evidence provided by data sets in relation to a particular\nscientific question.\nLearning\nObjective\n1.2 The student is able to evaluate evidence provided by data to qualitatively and\nquantitatively investigate the role of natural selection in evolution.\nBig Idea 2\nBiological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to reproduce,\nand to maintain dynamic homeostasis.\nEnduring\nUnderstanding\n2.A\nGrowth, reproduction and maintenance of living systems require free energy and matter.\nEssential\nKnowledge\n2.A.1 All living systems require constant input of free energy.\nScience\nPractice\n6.2 The student can construct explanations of phenomena based on evidence produced\nthrough scientific practices.\nLearning\nObjective\n2.1 The student is able to explain how biological systems use free energy based on empirical\ndata that all organisms require constant energy input to maintain organization, to grow and to\nreproduce.\nA species\u2019 life history describes the series of events over its lifetime, such as how resources are allocated for growth,\nmaintenance, and reproduction. Life history traits affect the life table of an organism. A species\u2019 life history is genetically\ndetermined and shaped by the environment and natural selection.\nLife History Patterns and Energy Budgets\nEnergy is required by all living organisms for their growth, maintenance, and reproduction; at the same time, energy is\noften a major limiting factor in determining an organism\u2019s survival. Plants, for example, acquire energy from the sun via\nphotosynthesis, but must expend this energy to grow, maintain health, and produce energy-rich seeds to produce the next\ngeneration. Animals have the additional burden of using some of their energy reserves to acquire food. Furthermore, some\nanimals must expend energy caring for their offspring. Thus, all species have an energy budget: they must balance energy\nintake with their use of energy for metabolism, reproduction, parental care, and energy storage (such as bears building up\nbody fat for winter hibernation).\nParental Care and Fecundity\nFecundity is the potential reproductive capacity of an individual within a population. In other words, fecundity describes\nhow many offspring could ideally be produced if an individual has as many offspring as possible, repeating the reproductive\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1601\ncycle as soon as possible after the birth of the offspring. In animals, fecundity is inversely related to the amount of parental\ncare given to an individual offspring. Species, such as many marine invertebrates, that produce many offspring usually\nprovide little if any care for the offspring (they would not have the energy or the ability to do so anyway). Most of their\nenergy budget is used to produce many tiny offspring. Animals with this strategy are often self-sufficient at a very early\nage. This is because of the energy tradeoff these organisms have made to maximize their evolutionary fitness. Because their\nenergy is used for producing offspring instead of parental care, it makes sense that these offspring have some ability to be\nable to move within their environment and find food and perhaps shelter. Even with these abilities, their small size makes\nthem extremely vulnerable to predation, so the production of many offspring allows enough of them to survive to maintain\nthe species.\nAnimal species that have few offspring during a reproductive event usually give extensive parental care, devoting much of\ntheir energy budget to these activities, sometimes at the expense of their own health. This is the case with many mammals,\nsuch as humans, kangaroos, and pandas. The offspring of these species are relatively helpless at birth and need to develop\nbefore they achieve self-sufficiency.\nPlants with low fecundity produce few energy-rich seeds (such as coconuts and chestnuts) with each having a good chance\nto germinate into a new organism; plants with high fecundity usually have many small, energy-poor seeds (like orchids)\nthat have a relatively poor chance of surviving. Although it may seem that coconuts and chestnuts have a better chance\nof surviving, the energy tradeoff of the orchid is also very effective. It is a matter of where the energy is used, for large\nnumbers of seeds or for fewer seeds with more energy.\nEarly versus Late Reproduction\nThe timing of reproduction in a life history also affects species survival. Organisms that reproduce at an early age have\na greater chance of producing offspring, but this is usually at the expense of their growth and the maintenance of their\nhealth. Conversely, organisms that start reproducing later in life often have greater fecundity or are better able to provide\nparental care, but they risk that they will not survive to reproductive age. Examples of this can be seen in fishes. Small\nfish like guppies use their energy to reproduce rapidly, but never attain the size that would give them defense against some\npredators. Larger fish, like the bluegill or shark, use their energy to attain a large size, but do so with the risk that they\nwill die before they can reproduce or at least reproduce to their maximum. These different energy strategies and tradeoffs\nare key to understanding the evolution of each species as it maximizes its fitness and fills its niche. In terms of energy\nbudgeting, some species \u201cblow it all\u201d and use up most of their energy reserves to reproduce early before they die. Other\nspecies delay having reproduction to become stronger, more experienced individuals and to make sure that they are strong\nenough to provide parental care if necessary.\nSingle versus Multiple Reproductive Events\nSome life history traits, such as fecundity, timing of reproduction, and parental care, can be grouped together into general\nstrategies that are used by multiple species. Semelparity occurs when a species reproduces only once during its lifetime\nand then dies. Such species use most of their resource budget during a single reproductive event, sacrificing their health\nto the point that they do not survive. Examples of semelparity are bamboo, which flowers once and then dies, and the\nChinook salmon (Figure 36.7a), which uses most of its energy reserves to migrate from the ocean to its freshwater nesting\narea, where it reproduces and then dies. Scientists have posited alternate explanations for the evolutionary advantage of\nthe Chinook\u2019s post-reproduction death: a programmed suicide caused by a massive release of corticosteroid hormones,\npresumably so the parents can become food for the offspring, or simple exhaustion caused by the energy demands of\nreproduction; these are still being debated.\nIteroparity describes species that reproduce repeatedly during their lives. Some animals are able to mate only once per\nyear, but survive multiple mating seasons. The pronghorn antelope is an example of an animal that goes into a seasonal\nestrus cycle (\u201cheat\u201d): a hormonally induced physiological condition preparing the body for successful mating (Figure\n36.7b). Females of these species mate only during the estrus phase of the cycle. A different pattern is observed in primates,\nincluding humans and chimpanzees, which may attempt reproduction at any time during their reproductive years, even\nthough their menstrual cycles make pregnancy likely only a few days per month during ovulation (Figure 36.7c).\n1602\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 36.7 The (a) Chinook salmon mates once and dies.

Some of this work has been done using the common fruit\nfly, Drosophila melanogaster. Studies have shown that not only does reproduction have a cost as far as\nhow long male fruit flies live, but also fruit flies that have already mated several times have limited sperm\nremaining for reproduction. Fruit flies maximize their last chances at reproduction by selecting optimal\nmates.\nIn a 1981 study, male fruit flies were placed in enclosures with either virgin or inseminated females. The\nmales that mated with virgin females had shorter life spans than those in contact with the same number\nof inseminated females with which they were unable to mate. This effect occurred regardless of how large\n(indicative of their age) the males were. Thus, males that did not mate lived longer, allowing them more\nopportunities to find mates in the future.\nMore recent studies, performed in 2006, show how males select the female with which they will mate and\nhow this is affected by previous matings (Figure 36.8).\n[2] Males were allowed to select between smaller\nand larger females. Findings showed that larger females had greater fecundity, producing twice as many\noffspring per mating as the smaller females did. Males that had previously mated, and thus had lower\nsupplies of sperm, were termed \u201cresource-depleted,\u201d while males that had not mated were termed \u201cnon-\nresource-depleted.\u201d The study showed that although non-resource-depleted males preferentially mated with\nlarger females, this selection of partners was more pronounced in the resource-depleted males. Thus,\nmales with depleted sperm supplies, which were limited in the number of times that they could mate before\nthey replenished their sperm supply, selected larger, more fecund females, thus maximizing their chances\nfor offspring. This study was one of the first to show that the physiological state of the male affected its\nmating behavior in a way that clearly maximizes its use of limited reproductive resources.\nFigure 36.8 Male fruit flies that had previously mated (sperm-depleted) picked larger, more fecund females more\noften than those that had not mated (non-sperm-depleted). This change in behavior causes an increase in the\nefficiency of a limited reproductive resource: sperm.\nThese studies demonstrate two ways in which the energy budget is a factor in reproduction. First, energy\nexpended on mating may reduce an animal\u2019s lifespan, but by this time they have already reproduced, so\nin the context of natural selection this early death is not of much evolutionary importance. Second, when\nresources such as sperm (and the energy needed to replenish it) are low, an organism\u2019s behavior can\nchange to give them the best chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. These changes in\nbehavior, so important to evolution, are studied in a discipline known as behavioral biology, or ethology, at\nthe interface between population biology and psychology.\nDiscuss how natural selection might influence the phenomenon revealed by this study.\na.\nSperm-depleted males were successful in producing offspring when mated with small females.

        "summary": "A species\u2019 life history is the genetically determined pattern of allocating energy for growth, maintenance, and reproduction, shaped by environmental conditions and natural selection. All organisms have an energy budget, requiring tradeoffs between fecundity, parental care, and survival. High-fecundity species, like many marine invertebrates and orchids, produce numerous offspring or seeds with little investment in each, while low-fecundity species, such as many mammals and plants like coconuts, produce fewer but better-provisioned offspring with greater parental care. Timing of reproduction also varies: early reproducers maximize chances of reproducing but often at the cost of growth and longevity, whereas later reproducers may invest more in offspring but risk not surviving to breed. Species may reproduce once and die (semelparity) or reproduce multiple times (iteroparity), with strategies influenced by survival probabilities and environmental pressures. Studies on fruit flies show that reproductive costs, such as reduced lifespan and limited sperm, prompt adaptive behaviors like selecting more fecund mates when resources are low, demonstrating how energy constraints and reproductive tradeoffs drive evolutionary adaptations in life history strategies."

Certain models that have been accepted for decades are now being modified or even abandoned due to their\nlack of predictive ability, and scholars strive to create effective new models.\nExponential Growth\nCharles Darwin, in his theory of natural selection, was greatly influenced by the English clergyman Thomas Malthus.\nMalthus published a book in 1798 stating that populations with unlimited natural resources grow very rapidly, and then\npopulation growth decreases as resources become depleted. This accelerating pattern of increasing population size is called\nexponential growth.\nThe best example of exponential growth is seen in bacteria. Bacteria are prokaryotes that reproduce by prokaryotic fission.\nThis division takes about an hour for many bacterial species. If 1000 bacteria are placed in a large flask with an unlimited\nsupply of nutrients (so the nutrients will not become depleted), after an hour, there is one round of division and each\norganism divides, resulting in 2000 organisms\u2014an increase of 1000. In another hour, each of the 2000 organisms will\ndouble, producing 4000, an increase of 2000 organisms. After the third hour, there should be 8000 bacteria in the flask, an\nincrease of 4000 organisms. The important concept of exponential growth is that the population growth rate\u2014the number\nof organisms added in each reproductive generation\u2014is accelerating; that is, it is increasing at a greater and greater rate.\nAfter 1 day and 24 of these cycles, the population would have increased from 1000 to more than 16 billion. When the\npopulation size, N, is plotted over time, a J-shaped growth curve is produced (Figure 36.9).\nThe bacteria example is not representative of the real world where resources are limited. Furthermore, some bacteria will\ndie during the experiment and thus not reproduce, lowering the growth rate. Therefore, when calculating the growth rate of\na population, the death rate (D) (number organisms that die during a particular time interval) is subtracted from the birth\nrate (B) (number organisms that are born during that interval). This is shown in the following formula:\n\u0394N (change in number)\n\u0394T (change in time)  = B (birth rate) - D (death rate)\nThe birth rate is usually expressed on a per capita (for each individual) basis. Thus, B (birth rate) = bN (the per capita birth\nrate \u201cb\u201d multiplied by the number of individuals \u201cN\u201d) and D (death rate) =dN (the per capita death rate \u201cd\u201d multiplied by\nthe number of individuals \u201cN\u201d). Additionally, ecologists are interested in the population at a particular point in time, an\ninfinitely small time interval. For this reason, the terminology of differential calculus is used to obtain the \u201cinstantaneous\u201d\ngrowth rate, replacing the change in number and time with an instant-specific measurement of number and time.\ndN\ndT  = bN \u2212 dN = (b -  d)N\nNotice that the \u201cd\u201d associated with the first term refers to the derivative (as the term is used in calculus) and is different\nfrom the death rate, also called \u201cd.\u201d The difference between birth and death rates is further simplified by substituting the\nterm \u201cr\u201d (intrinsic rate of increase) for the relationship between birth and death rates:\ndN\ndT  = rN\nThe value \u201cr\u201d can be positive, meaning the population is increasing in size; or negative, meaning the population is\ndecreasing in size; or zero, where the population\u2019s size is unchanging, a condition known as zero population growth. A\nfurther refinement of the formula recognizes that different species have inherent differences in their intrinsic rate of increase\n(often thought of as the potential for reproduction), even under ideal conditions. Obviously, a bacterium can reproduce\n1606\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nmore rapidly and have a higher intrinsic rate of growth than a human. The maximal growth rate for a species is its biotic\npotential, or rmax, thus changing the equation to:\ndN\ndT = rmax N\nFigure 36.9 When resources are unlimited, populations exhibit exponential growth, resulting in a J-shaped curve.\nWhen resources are limited, populations exhibit logistic growth. In logistic growth, population expansion decreases as\nresources become scarce, and it levels off when the carrying capacity of the environment is reached, resulting in an\nS-shaped curve.\nLogistic Growth\nExponential growth is possible only when infinite natural resources are available; this is not the case in the real world.\nCharles Darwin recognized this fact in his description of the \u201cstruggle for existence,\u201d which states that individuals will\ncompete (with members of their own or other species) for limited resources. The successful ones will survive to pass on\ntheir own characteristics and traits (which we know now are transferred by genes) to the next generation at a greater rate\n(natural selection). To model the reality of limited resources, population ecologists developed the logistic growth model.\nCarrying Capacity and the Logistic Model\nIn the real world, with its limited resources, exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely. Exponential growth may occur\nin environments where there are few individuals and plentiful resources, but when the number of individuals gets large\nenough, resources will be depleted, slowing the growth rate. Eventually, the growth rate will plateau or level off (Figure\n36.9). This population size, which represents the maximum population size that a particular environment can support, is\ncalled the carrying capacity, or K.\nThe formula we use to calculate logistic growth adds the carrying capacity as a moderating force in the growth rate. The\nexpression \u201cK \u2013 N\u201d is indicative of how many individuals may be added to a population at a given stage, and \u201cK \u2013 N\u201d\ndivided by \u201cK\u201d is the fraction of the carrying capacity available for further growth. Thus, the exponential growth model is\nrestricted by this factor to generate the logistic growth equation:\ndN\ndT = rmax dN\ndT = rmax N(K -  N)\nK\nNotice that when N is very small, (K-N)/K becomes close to K/K or 1, and the right side of the equation reduces to rmaxN,\nwhich means the population is growing exponentially and is not influenced by carrying capacity. On the other hand, when\nN is large, (K-N)/K come close to zero, which means that population growth will be slowed greatly or even stopped.\nThus, population growth is greatly slowed in large populations by the carrying capacity K. This model also allows for the\npopulation of a negative population growth, or a population decline. This occurs when the number of individuals in the\npopulation exceeds the carrying capacity (because the value of (K-N)/K is negative).\nA graph of this equation yields an S-shaped curve (Figure 36.9), and it is a more realistic model of population growth than\nexponential growth. There are three different sections to an S-shaped curve. Initially, growth is exponential because there\nare few individuals and ample resources available. Then, as resources begin to become limited, the growth rate decreases.\nFinally, growth levels off at the carrying capacity of the environment, with little change in population size over time.\nRole of Intraspecific Competition\nThe logistic model assumes that every individual within a population will have equal access to resources and, thus, an equal\nchance for survival. For plants, the amount of water, sunlight, nutrients, and the space to grow are the important resources,\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1607\nwhereas in animals, important resources include food, water, shelter, nesting space, and mates.\nIn the real world, phenotypic variation among individuals within a population means that some individuals will be better\nadapted to their environment than others. The resulting competition between population members of the same species\nfor resources is termed intraspecific competition (intra- = \u201cwithin\u201d; -specific = \u201cspecies\u201d). Intraspecific competition for\nresources may not affect populations that are well below their carrying capacity\u2014resources are plentiful and all individuals\ncan obtain what they need. However, as population size increases, this competition intensifies. In addition, the accumulation\nof waste products can reduce an environment\u2019s carrying capacity.\nExamples of Logistic Growth\nYeast, a microscopic fungus used to make bread, exhibits the classical S-shaped curve when grown in a test tube (Figure\n36.10a). Its growth levels off as the population depletes the nutrients that are necessary for its growth. In the real world,\nhowever, there are variations to this idealized curve. Examples in wild populations include sheep and harbor seals (Figure\n36.10b). In both examples, the population size exceeds the carrying capacity for short periods of time and then falls below\nthe carrying capacity afterwards. This fluctuation in population size continues to occur as the population oscillates around\nits carrying capacity. Still, even with this oscillation, the logistic model is confirmed.\nThink About It\nDescribe the rate of population growth that would be expected at various parts of the S-shaped curve of logistic growth.\n1608\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 36.10 (a) Yeast grown in ideal conditions in a test tube show a classical S-shaped logistic growth curve,\nwhereas (b) a natural population of seals shows real-world fluctuation.\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1609\nExplain the underlying reasons for the differences in the two curves shown in these examples.\na.\nYeast is grown under ideal conditions, so the curve reflects limitations of resources in the controlled\nenvironment.

Implicit in the model is that the carrying capacity of the environment does not change,\nwhich is not the case. The carrying capacity varies annually: for example, some summers are hot and dry whereas others\nare cold and wet. In many areas, the carrying capacity during the winter is much lower than it is during the summer.\nAlso, natural events such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and fires can alter an environment and hence its carrying capacity.\nAdditionally, populations do not usually exist in isolation. They engage in interspecific competition: that is, they share\nthe environment with other species, competing with them for the same resources. These factors are also important to\nunderstanding how a specific population will grow.\nNature regulates population growth in a variety of ways. These are grouped into density-dependent factors, in which\nthe density of the population at a given time affects growth rate and mortality, and density-independent factors, which\ninfluence mortality in a population regardless of population density. Note that in the former, the effect of the factor on the\npopulation depends on the density of the population at onset. Conservation biologists want to understand both types because\nthis helps them manage populations and prevent extinction or overpopulation.\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1611\n",
        "summary": "Environmental limits to population growth are modeled using exponential and logistic growth patterns. Exponential growth occurs when resources are unlimited, resulting in a J-shaped curve where the growth rate accelerates over time, as seen in bacteria under ideal conditions. However, in the real world, resources are finite, leading to logistic growth, where populations expand rapidly at first, then slow as resources become scarce, and eventually stabilize at the environment\u2019s carrying capacity (K), producing an S-shaped curve. The logistic model accounts for limited resources and intraspecific competition, where individuals of the same species compete for essentials like food, water, shelter, and mates. Growth may plateau, fluctuate, or even decline if the population exceeds carrying capacity. Examples include yeast in controlled environments and animal populations like sheep and harbor seals in nature, where oscillations around carrying capacity occur due to environmental variability and additional pressures."

Implicit in the model is that the carrying capacity of the environment does not change,\nwhich is not the case. The carrying capacity varies annually: for example, some summers are hot and dry whereas others\nare cold and wet. In many areas, the carrying capacity during the winter is much lower than it is during the summer.\nAlso, natural events such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and fires can alter an environment and hence its carrying capacity.\nAdditionally, populations do not usually exist in isolation. They engage in interspecific competition: that is, they share\nthe environment with other species, competing with them for the same resources. These factors are also important to\nunderstanding how a specific population will grow.\nNature regulates population growth in a variety of ways. These are grouped into density-dependent factors, in which\nthe density of the population at a given time affects growth rate and mortality, and density-independent factors, which\ninfluence mortality in a population regardless of population density. Note that in the former, the effect of the factor on the\npopulation depends on the density of the population at onset. Conservation biologists want to understand both types because\nthis helps them manage populations and prevent extinction or overpopulation.\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1611\nDensity-dependent Regulation\nMost density-dependent factors are biological in nature (biotic), and include predation, inter- and intraspecific competition,\naccumulation of waste, and diseases such as those caused by parasites. Usually, the denser a population is, the greater its\nmortality rate. For example, during intra- and interspecific competition, the reproductive rates of the individuals will usually\nbe lower, reducing their population\u2019s rate of growth. In addition, low prey density increases the mortality of its predator\nbecause it has more difficulty locating its food source.\nAn example of density-dependent regulation is shown in Figure 36.11 with results from a study focusing on the giant\nintestinal roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), a parasite of humans and other mammals.\n[3] Denser populations of the parasite\nexhibited lower fecundity: they contained fewer eggs. One possible explanation for this is that females would be smaller\nin more dense populations (due to limited resources) and that smaller females would have fewer eggs. This hypothesis was\ntested and disproved in a 2009 study which showed that female weight had no influence.\n[4] The actual cause of the density-\ndependence of fecundity in this organism is still unclear and awaiting further investigation.\nFigure 36.11 In this population of roundworms, fecundity (number of eggs) decreases with population density.\n[5]\n3.

An individual deer may be killed in a forest fire regardless of\nhow many deer happen to be in that area. Its chances of survival are the same whether the population density is high or low.\nThe same holds true for cold winter weather.\nIn real-life situations, population regulation is very complicated and density-dependent and independent factors can interact.\nA dense population that is reduced in a density-independent manner by some environmental factor(s) will be able to recover\ndifferently than a sparse population. For example, a population of deer affected by a harsh winter will recover faster if there\nare more deer remaining to reproduce.\nThink About It\nDescribe an example of how density-dependent and density-independent factors might interact.\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1613\nWhy Did the Woolly Mammoth Go Extinct?\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 36.13 The three photos include: (a) 1916 mural of a mammoth herd from the American Museum of Natural\nHistory, (b) the only stuffed mammoth in the world, from the Museum of Zoology located in St. Petersburg, Russia,\nand (c) a one-month-old baby mammoth, named Lyuba, discovered in Siberia in 2007. (credit a: modification of\nwork by Charles R. Knight; credit b: modification of work by \u201cTanapon\u201d/Flickr; credit c: modification of work by Matt\nHowry)\nIt's easy to get lost in the discussion of dinosaurs and theories about why they went extinct 65 million years\nago. Was it due to a meteor slamming into Earth near the coast of modern-day Mexico, or was it from some\nlong-term weather cycle that is not yet understood? One hypothesis that will never be proposed is that\nhumans had something to do with it. Mammals were small, insignificant creatures of the forest 65 million\nyears ago, and no humans existed.\nWoolly mammoths, however, began to go extinct about 10,000 years ago, when they shared the Earth\nwith humans who were no different anatomically than humans today (Figure 36.13). Mammoths survived\nin isolated island populations as recently as 1700 BC. We know a lot about these animals from carcasses\nfound frozen in the ice of Siberia and other regions of the north. Scientists have sequenced at least 50\npercent of its genome and believe mammoths are between 98 and 99 percent identical to modern elephants.\nIt is commonly thought that climate change and human hunting led to their extinction. A 2008 study\nestimated that climate change reduced the mammoth\u2019s range from 3,000,000 square miles 42,000 years\nago to 310,000 square miles 6,000 years ago.\n[6] It is also well documented that humans hunted these\nanimals. A 2012 study showed that no single factor was exclusively responsible for the extinction of these\nmagnificent creatures.\n[7] In addition to human hunting, climate change, and reduction of habitat, these\nscientists demonstrated another important factor in the mammoth\u2019s extinction was the migration of humans\nacross the Bering Strait to North America during the last ice age 20,000 years ago.\nThe maintenance of stable populations was and is very complex, with many interacting factors determining\nthe outcome. It is important to remember that humans are also part of nature.

The regulation of population growth by these factors can be used to introduce a classical concept in\npopulation biology, that of K-selected versus r-selected species.\nEarly Theories about Life History: K-selected and r-selected Species\nBy the second half of the twentieth century, the concept of K- and r-selected species was used extensively and successfully\nto study populations. The concept relates not only reproductive strategies, but also to a species\u2019 habitat and behavior,\nespecially in the way that they obtain resources and care for their young. It includes length of life and survivorship\nfactors as well. For this analysis, population biologists have grouped species into the two large categories\u2014K-selected and\nr-selected\u2014although they are really two ends of a continuum.\nK-selected species are species selected by stable, predictable environments. Populations of K-selected species tend to exist\nclose to their carrying capacity (hence the term K-selected) where intraspecific competition is high. These species have few,\nlarge offspring, a long gestation period, and often give long-term care to their offspring (Table B45_04_01). While larger\nin size when born, the offspring are relatively helpless and immature at birth. By the time they reach adulthood, they must\ndevelop skills to compete for natural resources. In plants, scientists think of parental care more broadly: how long fruit takes\nto develop or how long it remains on the plant are determining factors in the time to the next reproductive event. Examples\nof K-selected species are primates (including humans), elephants, and plants such as oak trees (Figure 36.14a).\nOak trees grow very slowly and take, on average, 20 years to produce their first seeds, known as acorns. As many as 50,000\nacorns can be produced by an individual tree, but the germination rate is low as many of these rot or are eaten by animals\nsuch as squirrels. In some years, oaks may produce an exceptionally large number of acorns, and these years may be on a\ntwo- or three-year cycle depending on the species of oak (r-selection).\nAs oak trees grow to a large size and for many years before they begin to produce acorns, they devote a large percentage\nof their energy budget to growth and maintenance. The tree\u2019s height and size allow it to dominate other plants in the\ncompetition for sunlight, the oak\u2019s primary energy resource. Furthermore, when it does reproduce, the oak produces large,\nenergy-rich seeds that use their energy reserve to become quickly established (K-selection).\nIn contrast, r-selected species have a large number of small offspring (hence their r designation (Table 36.2). This\nstrategy is often employed in unpredictable or changing environments. Animals that are r-selected do not give long-term\nparental care and the offspring are relatively mature and self-sufficient at birth. Examples of r-selected species are marine\ninvertebrates, such as jellyfish, and plants, such as the dandelion (Figure 36.14b). Dandelions have small seeds that are\nwind dispersed long distances. Many seeds are produced simultaneously to ensure that at least some of them reach a\nhospitable environment. Seeds that land in inhospitable environments have little chance for survival since their seeds are\nlow in energy content. Note that survival is not necessarily a function of energy stored in the seed itself.\nCharacteristics of K-selected and r-selected species\nCharacteristics of K-selected species\nCharacteristics of r-selected species\nMature late\nMature early\nGreater longevity\nLower longevity\nIncreased parental care\nDecreased parental care\nIncreased competition\nDecreased competition\nFewer offspring\nMore offspring\nLarger offspring\nSmaller offspring\nTable 36.2\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1615\nFigure 36.14 (a) Elephants are considered K-selected species as they live long, mature late, and provide long-term\nparental care to few offspring. Oak trees produce many offspring that do not receive parental care, but are considered\nK-selected species based on longevity and late maturation. (b) Dandelions and jellyfish are both considered r-selected\nspecies as they mature early, have short lifespans, and produce many offspring that receive no parental care.\nModern Theories of Life History\nThe r- and K-selection theory, although accepted for decades and used for much groundbreaking research, has now been\nreconsidered, and many population biologists have abandoned or modified it. Over the years, several studies attempted to\nconfirm the theory, but these attempts have largely failed. Many species were identified that did not follow the theory\u2019s\npredictions. Furthermore, the theory ignored the age-specific mortality of the populations which scientists now know is\nvery important. New demographic-based models of life history evolution have been developed which incorporate many\necological concepts included in r- and K-selection theory as well as population age structure and mortality factors.\nSection Summary\nPopulations are regulated by a variety of density-dependent and density-independent factors. Species are divided into two\ncategories based on a variety of features of their life history patterns: r-selected species, which have large numbers of\noffspring, and K-selected species, which have few offspring.

        "summary": "Population dynamics are influenced by changes in carrying capacity, which can fluctuate with environmental conditions, natural events, and interspecific competition. Regulation occurs through density-dependent factors, such as predation, competition, waste accumulation, and disease, whose effects vary with population density, and density-independent factors, such as weather, natural disasters, and pollution, which impact populations regardless of density. These factors often interact, complicating recovery and growth patterns. Life history strategies also affect population regulation, with K-selected species thriving in stable environments, producing few large offspring with high parental investment, and r-selected species adapted to unpredictable environments, producing many small offspring with low parental investment. While r/K selection theory has been largely replaced by demographic models incorporating age structure and mortality, many of its core concepts still inform modern understanding of population regulation."

Like animals,\nhumans are affected by abiotic and biotic factors. Unlike animals, humans have the ability to manipulate the factors affecting\nthe growth of their population. As a result, additional factors come into play when studying human population dynamics.\nWhen studying projections of human population growth, ethical questions can also come to light.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 4 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework.

Humans are not unique in their ability\nto alter their environment. For example, beaver dams alter the stream environment where they are built. Humans, however,\nhave the ability to alter their environment to increase its carrying capacity sometimes to the detriment of other species (e.g.,\nvia artificial selection for crops that have a higher yield). Earth\u2019s human population is growing rapidly, to the extent that\nsome worry about the ability of the earth\u2019s environment to sustain this population, as long-term exponential growth carries\nthe potential risks of famine, disease, and large-scale death.\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1617\nAlthough humans have increased the carrying capacity of their environment, the technologies used to achieve this\ntransformation have caused unprecedented changes to Earth\u2019s environment, altering ecosystems to the point where some\nmay be in danger of collapse. The depletion of the ozone layer, erosion due to acid rain, and damage from global climate\nchange are caused by human activities. The ultimate effect of these changes on our carrying capacity is unknown. As some\npoint out, it is likely that the negative effects of increasing carrying capacity will outweigh the positive ones\u2014the carrying\ncapacity of the world for human beings might actually decrease.\nThe world\u2019s human population is currently experiencing exponential growth even though human reproduction is far below\nits biotic potential (Figure 36.15). To reach its biotic potential, all females would have to become pregnant every nine\nmonths or so during their reproductive years. Also, resources would have to be such that the environment would support\nsuch growth. Neither of these two conditions exists. In spite of this fact, human population is still growing exponentially.\nFigure 36.15 Human population growth since 1000 AD is exponential (dark blue line). Notice that while the population\nin Asia (yellow line), which has many economically underdeveloped countries, is increasing exponentially, the\npopulation in Europe (light blue line), where most of the countries are economically developed, is growing much more\nslowly.\nA consequence of exponential human population growth is the time that it takes to add a particular number of humans to the\nEarth is becoming shorter. Figure 36.16 shows that 123 years were necessary to add 1 billion humans in 1930, but it only\ntook 24 years to add two billion people between 1975 and 1999. As already discussed, at some point it would appear that\nour ability to increase our carrying capacity indefinitely on a finite world is uncertain. Without new technological advances,\nthe human growth rate has been predicted to slow in the coming decades. However, the population will still be increasing\nand the threat of overpopulation remains.\n1618\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 36.16 The time between the addition of each billion human beings to Earth decreases over time.

Much of this ability is related to human intelligence, society, and communication. Humans can construct shelter\nto protect them from the elements and have developed agriculture and domesticated animals to increase their food supplies.\nIn addition, humans use language to communicate this technology to new generations, allowing them to improve upon\nprevious accomplishments.\nOther factors in human population growth are migration and public health. Humans originated in Africa, but have since\nmigrated to nearly all inhabitable land on the Earth. Public health, sanitation, and the use of antibiotics and vaccines have\ndecreased the ability of infectious disease to limit human population growth. In the past, diseases such as the bubonic plaque\nof the fourteenth century killed between 30 and 60 percent of Europe\u2019s population and reduced the overall world population\nby as many as 100 million people. Today, the threat of infectious disease, while not gone, is certainly less severe. According\nto the World Health Organization, global death from infectious disease declined from 16.4 million in 1993 to 14.7 million\nin 2002. To compare to some of the epidemics of the past, the percentage of the world's population killed between 1993 and\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1619\n2002 decreased from 0.30 percent of the world's population to 0.24 percent. Thus, it appears that the influence of infectious\ndisease on human population growth is becoming less significant.\nAge Structure, Population Growth, and Economic Development\nThe age structure of a population is an important factor in population dynamics. Age structure is the proportion of a\npopulation at different age ranges. Age structure allows better prediction of population growth, plus the ability to associate\nthis growth with the level of economic development in the region. Countries with rapid growth have a pyramidal shape in\ntheir age structure diagrams, showing a preponderance of younger individuals, many of whom are of reproductive age or\nwill be soon (Figure 36.17). This pattern is most often observed in underdeveloped countries where individuals do not live\nto old age because of less-than-optimal living conditions. Age structures of areas with slow growth, including developed\ncountries such as the United States, still have a pyramidal structure, but with many fewer young and reproductive-aged\nindividuals and a greater proportion of older individuals. Other developed countries, such as Italy, have zero population\ngrowth. The age structure of these populations is more conical, with an even greater percentage of middle-aged and older\nindividuals. The actual growth rates in different countries are shown in Figure 36.18, with the highest rates tending to be in\nthe less economically developed countries of Africa and Asia.\nFigure 36.17 Typical age structure diagrams are shown. The rapid growth diagram narrows to a point, indicating\nthat the number of individuals decreases rapidly with age. In the slow growth model, the number of individuals\ndecreases steadily with age. Stable population diagrams are rounded on the top, showing that the number of\nindividuals per age group decreases gradually, and then increases for the older part of the population.\nCompare the age structure for Stage 4 to that of Stage 3.

Notice that the highest growth is\noccurring in less economically developed countries in Africa and Asia.\nLong-Term Consequences of Exponential Human Population Growth\nMany dire predictions have been made about the world\u2019s population leading to a major crisis called the \u201cpopulation\nexplosion.\u201d In the 1968 book The Population Bomb, biologist Dr. Paul R. Ehrlich wrote, \u201cThe battle to feed all of humanity\nis over. In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now.\nAt this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate.\u201d\n[8] While many critics view this statement\nas an exaggeration, the laws of exponential population growth are still in effect, and unchecked human population growth\ncannot continue indefinitely.\nEfforts to control population growth led to the one-child policy in China, which used to include more severe consequences,\nbut now imposes fines on urban couples who have more than one child. Due to the fact that some couples wish to have\na male heir, many Chinese couples continue to have more than one child. The policy itself, its social impacts, and the\neffectiveness of limiting overall population growth are controversial. In spite of population control policies, the human\npopulation continues to grow. At some point the food supply may run out because of the subsequent need to produce more\nand more food to feed our population. The United Nations estimates that future world population growth may vary from 6\nbillion (a decrease) to 16 billion people by the year 2100. There is no way to know whether human population growth will\nmoderate to the point where the crisis described by Dr. Ehrlich will be averted.\nAnother result of population growth is the endangerment of the natural environment. Many countries have attempted to\nreduce the human impact on climate change by reducing their emission of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. However,\nthese treaties have not been ratified by every country, and many underdeveloped countries trying to improve their economic\ncondition may be less likely to agree with such provisions if it means slower economic development. Furthermore, the\nrole of human activity in causing climate change has become a hotly debated socio-political issue in some developed\ncountries, including the United States. Thus, we enter the future with considerable uncertainty about our ability to curb\nhuman population growth and protect our environment.\nThink About It\nDescribe the age structures in rapidly growing countries, slowly growing countries, and countries with zero population\ngrowth.\n8.

        "summary": "Human population growth is currently exponential, fueled by humans\u2019 unique ability to alter their environment and expand its carrying capacity through migration, agriculture, medical advances, public health, and communication. While these developments have reduced the impact of limiting factors such as disease, they have also caused major environmental changes with uncertain long-term effects. Age structure influences growth patterns, with underdeveloped countries showing rapid growth due to high proportions of young people, while developed nations exhibit slower or zero growth with older populations. Despite policies like China\u2019s one-child rule, global population continues to rise, raising concerns about food shortages, resource depletion, and environmental degradation, including climate change. The future trajectory of population growth and its environmental impact remains uncertain, with potential consequences if growth is not slowed."

In most cases, numerous species share a\nhabitat. The interactions between these populations play a major role in regulating population growth and abundance. All\npopulations occupying the same habitat form a community: populations inhabiting a specific area at the same time. The\nnumber of species occupying the same habitat and their relative abundance is known as species diversity. Areas with low\ndiversity, such as the glaciers of Antarctica, still contain a wide variety of living things, whereas the diversity of tropical\nrainforests is so great that it cannot be counted. Ecology is studied at the community level to understand how species interact\nwith each other and compete for the same resources.\nPredation and Herbivory\nPerhaps the classical example of species interaction is predation: the hunting of prey by its predator. Nature shows on\ntelevision highlight the drama of one living organism killing another. Populations of predators and prey in a community\nare not constant over time: in most cases, they vary in cycles that appear to be related. The most often cited example of\npredator-prey dynamics is seen in the cycling of the lynx (predator) and the snowshoe hare (prey), using nearly 200 year-old\ntrapping data from North American forests (Figure 36.19). This cycle of predator and prey lasts approximately 10 years,\nwith the predator population lagging 1\u20132 years behind that of the prey population. As the hare numbers increase, there is\nmore food available for the lynx, allowing the lynx population to increase as well. When the lynx population grows to a\nthreshold level, however, they kill so many hares that hare population begins to decline, followed by a decline in the lynx\npopulation because of scarcity of food. When the lynx population is low, the hare population size begins to increase due, at\nleast in part, to low predation pressure, starting the cycle anew.\nFigure 36.19 The cycling of lynx and snowshoe hare populations in Northern Ontario is an example of predator-prey\ndynamics.\nThe idea that the population cycling of the two species is entirely controlled by predation models has come under question.\nMore recent studies have pointed to undefined density-dependent factors as being important in the cycling, in addition to\npredation. One possibility is that the cycling is inherent in the hare population due to density-dependent effects such as\nlower fecundity (maternal stress) caused by crowding when the hare population gets too dense. The hare cycling would\nthen induce the cycling of the lynx because it is the lynxes\u2019 major food source. The more we study communities, the more\ncomplexities we find, allowing ecologists to derive more accurate and sophisticated models of population dynamics.\nHerbivory describes the consumption of plants by insects and other animals, and it is another interspecific relationship that\naffects populations. Unlike animals, most plants cannot outrun predators or use mimicry to hide from hungry animals. Some\n1624\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nplants have developed mechanisms to defend against herbivory. Other species have developed mutualistic relationships; for\nexample, herbivory provides a mechanism of seed distribution that aids in plant reproduction.\nDefense Mechanisms against Predation and Herbivory\nThe study of communities must consider evolutionary forces that act on the members of the various populations contained\nwithin it. Species are not static, but slowly changing and adapting to their environment by natural selection and other\nevolutionary forces. Species have evolved numerous mechanisms to escape predation and herbivory. These defenses may\nbe mechanical, chemical, physical, or behavioral.\nMechanical defenses, such as the presence of thorns on plants or the hard shell on turtles, discourage animal predation and\nherbivory by causing physical pain to the predator or by physically preventing the predator from being able to eat the prey.\nChemical defenses are produced by many animals as well as plants, such as the foxglove which is extremely toxic when\neaten. Figure 36.20 shows some organisms\u2019 defenses against predation and herbivory.\nFigure 36.20 The (a) honey locust tree (Gleditsia triacanthos) uses thorns, a mechanical defense, against herbivores,\nwhile the (b) Florida red-bellied turtle (Pseudemys nelsoni) uses its shell as a mechanical defense against predators.\n(c) Foxglove (Digitalis sp.) uses a chemical defense: toxins produced by the plant can cause nausea, vomiting,\nhallucinations, convulsions, or death when consumed. (d) The North American millipede (Narceus americanus) uses\nboth mechanical and chemical defenses: when threatened, the millipede curls into a defensive ball and produces a\nnoxious substance that irritates eyes and skin.

The tropical walking stick is an\ninsect with the coloration and body shape of a twig which makes it very hard to see when stationary against a background\nof real twigs (Figure 36.21a). In another example, the chameleon can change its color to match its surroundings (Figure\n36.21b). Both of these are examples of camouflage, or avoiding detection by blending in with the background.\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1625\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 36.21 (a) The tropical walking stick and (b) the chameleon use body shape and/or coloration to prevent\ndetection by predators. (credit a: modification of work by Linda Tanner; credit b: modification of work by Frank Vassen)\nSome species use coloration as a way of warning predators that they are not good to eat. For example, the cinnabar moth\ncaterpillar, the fire-bellied toad, and many species of beetle have bright colors that warn of a foul taste, the presence of\ntoxic chemical, and/or the ability to sting or bite, respectively. Predators that ignore this coloration and eat the organisms\nwill experience their unpleasant taste or presence of toxic chemicals and learn not to eat them in the future. This type of\ndefensive mechanism is called aposematic coloration, or warning coloration (Figure 36.22).\nFigure 36.22 (a) The strawberry poison dart frog (Oophaga pumilio) uses aposematic coloration to warn predators\nthat it is toxic, while the (b) striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) uses aposematic coloration to warn predators of the\nunpleasant odor it produces. (credit a: modification of work by Jay Iwasaki; credit b: modification of work by Dan\nDzurisin)\nWhile some predators learn to avoid eating certain potential prey because of their coloration, other species have evolved\nmechanisms to mimic this coloration to avoid being eaten, even though they themselves may not be unpleasant to eat\nor contain toxic chemicals. In Batesian mimicry, a harmless species imitates the warning coloration of a harmful one.\nAssuming they share the same predators, this coloration then protects the harmless ones, even though they do not have the\nsame level of physical or chemical defenses against predation as the organism they mimic. Many insect species mimic the\ncoloration of wasps or bees, which are stinging, venomous insects, thereby discouraging predation (Figure 36.23).\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 36.23 Batesian mimicry occurs when a harmless species mimics the coloration of a harmful species, as is seen\nwith the (a) bumblebee and (b) bee-like robber fly. (credit a, b: modification of work by Cory Zanker)\n1626\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nIn M\u00fcllerian mimicry, multiple species share the same warning coloration, but all of them actually have defenses. Figure\n36.24 shows a variety of foul-tasting butterflies with similar coloration. In Emsleyan/Mertensian mimicry, a deadly prey\nmimics a less dangerous one, such as the venomous coral snake mimicking the non-venomous milk snake. This type of\nmimicry is extremely rare and more difficult to understand than the previous two types. For this type of mimicry to work,\nit is essential that eating the milk snake has unpleasant but not fatal consequences. Then, these predators learn not to eat\nsnakes with this coloration, protecting the coral snake as well. If the snake were fatal to the predator, there would be no\nopportunity for the predator to learn not to eat it, and the benefit for the less toxic species would disappear.\nFigure 36.24 Several unpleasant-tasting Heliconius butterfly species share a similar color pattern with better-tasting\nvarieties, an example of M\u00fcllerian mimicry.

All species have an\necological niche in the ecosystem, which describes how they acquire the resources they need and how they interact with\nother species in the community. The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot occupy the same niche\nin a habitat. In other words, different species cannot coexist in a community if they are competing for all the same resources.\nAn example of this principle is shown in Figure 36.25, with two protozoan species, Paramecium aurelia and Paramecium\ncaudatum. When grown individually in the laboratory, they both thrive. But when they are placed together in the same test\ntube (habitat), P. aurelia outcompetes P. caudatum for food, leading to the latter\u2019s eventual extinction.\nFigure 36.25 Paramecium aurelia and Paramecium caudatum grow well individually, but when they compete for the\nsame resources, the P. aurelia outcompetes the P. caudatum.\nThis exclusion may be avoided if a population evolves to make use of a different resource, a different area of the habitat,\nor feeds during a different time of day, called resource partitioning. The two organisms are then said to occupy different\nmicroniches. These organisms coexist by minimizing direct competition.\nSymbiosis\nSymbiotic relationships, or symbioses (plural), are close interactions between individuals of different species over an\nextended period of time which impact the abundance and distribution of the associating populations. Most scientists accept\nthis definition, but some restrict the term to only those species that are mutualistic, where both individuals benefit from the\ninteraction. In this discussion, the broader definition will be used.\nCommensalism\nA commensal relationship occurs when one species benefits from the close, prolonged interaction, while the other neither\nbenefits nor is harmed. Birds nesting in trees provide an example of a commensal relationship (Figure 36.26). The tree is\nnot harmed by the presence of the nest among its branches. The nests are light and produce little strain on the structural\nintegrity of the branch, and most of the leaves, which the tree uses to get energy by photosynthesis, are above the nest so\nthey are unaffected. The bird, on the other hand, benefits greatly. If the bird had to nest in the open, its eggs and young\nwould be vulnerable to predators. Another example of a commensal relationship is the clown fish and the sea anemone.\nThe sea anemone is not harmed by the fish, and the fish benefits with protection from predators who would be stung upon\nnearing the sea anemone.\n1628\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 36.26 The southern masked-weaver bird is starting to make a nest in a tree in Zambezi Valley, Zambia. This\nis an example of a commensal relationship, in which one species (the bird) benefits, while the other (the tree) neither\nbenefits nor is harmed. (credit: \u201cHanay\u201d/Wikimedia Commons)\nMutualism\nA second type of symbiotic relationship is called mutualism, where two species benefit from their interaction. Some\nscientists believe that these are the only true examples of symbiosis. For example, termites have a mutualistic relationship\nwith protozoa that live in the insect\u2019s gut (Figure 36.27a). The termite benefits from the ability of bacterial symbionts\nwithin the protozoa to digest cellulose. The termite itself cannot do this, and without the protozoa, it would not be able to\nobtain energy from its food (cellulose from the wood it chews and eats). The protozoa and the bacterial symbionts benefit\nby having a protective environment and a constant supply of food from the wood chewing actions of the termite. Lichens\nhave a mutualistic relationship between fungus and photosynthetic algae or bacteria (Figure 36.27b). As these symbionts\ngrow together, the glucose produced by the algae provides nourishment for both organisms, whereas the physical structure\nof the lichen protects the algae from the elements and makes certain nutrients in the atmosphere more available to the algae.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 36.27 (a) Termites form a mutualistic relationship with symbiotic protozoa in their guts, which allow both\norganisms to obtain energy from the cellulose the termite consumes. (b) Lichen is a fungus that has symbiotic\nphotosynthetic algae living inside its cells. (credit a: modification of work by Scott Bauer, USDA; credit b: modification\nof work by Cory Zanker)\nParasitism\nA parasite is an organism that lives in or on another living organism and derives nutrients from it. In this relationship,\nthe parasite benefits, but the organism being fed upon, the host is harmed. The host is usually weakened by the parasite\nas it siphons resources the host would normally use to maintain itself. The parasite, however, is unlikely to kill the host,\nespecially not quickly, because this would allow no time for the organism to complete its reproductive cycle by spreading\nto another host.\nThe reproductive cycles of parasites are often very complex, sometimes requiring more than one host species. A tapeworm\nis a parasite that causes disease in humans when contaminated, undercooked meat such as pork, fish, or beef is consumed\n(Figure 36.28). The tapeworm can live inside the intestine of the host for several years, benefiting from the food the host\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1629\nis bringing into its gut by eating, and may grow to be over 50 ft long by adding segments. The parasite moves from species\nto species in a cycle, making two hosts necessary to complete its life cycle. Another common parasite is Plasmodium\nfalciparum, the protozoan cause of malaria, a significant disease in many parts of the world. Living in human liver and\nred blood cells, the organism reproduces asexually in the gut of blood-feeding mosquitoes to complete its life cycle. Thus\nmalaria is spread from human to human by mosquitoes, one of many arthropod-borne infectious diseases.\nFigure 36.28 This diagram shows the life cycle of a pork tapeworm (Taenia solium), a human worm parasite. (credit:\nmodification of work by CDC)\nCharacteristics of Communities\nCommunities are complex entities that can be characterized by their structure (the types and numbers of species present)\nand dynamics (how communities change over time). Understanding community structure and dynamics enables community\necologists to manage ecosystems more effectively.\nFoundation Species\nFoundation species are considered the \u201cbase\u201d or \u201cbedrock\u201d of a community, having the greatest influence on its overall\nstructure. They are usually the primary producers: organisms that bring most of the energy into the community. Kelp, brown\nalgae, is a foundation species, forming the basis of the kelp forests off the coast of California.\nFoundation species may physically modify the environment to produce and maintain habitats that benefit the other\norganisms that use them. An example is the photosynthetic corals of the coral reef (Figure 36.29). Corals themselves\nare not photosynthetic, but harbor symbionts within their body tissues (dinoflagellates called zooxanthellae) that perform\nphotosynthesis; this is another example of a mutualism. The exoskeletons of living and dead coral make up most of the reef\nstructure, which protects many other species from waves and ocean currents.\n1630\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 36.29 Coral is the foundation species of coral reef ecosystems. (credit: Jim E. Maragos, USFWS)\nBiodiversity, Species Richness, and Relative Species Abundance\nBiodiversity describes a community\u2019s biological complexity: it is measured by the number of different species (species\nrichness) in a particular area and their relative abundance (species evenness). The area in question could be a habitat, a\nbiome, or the entire biosphere. Species richness is the term that is used to describe the number of species living in a habitat\nor biome. Species richness varies across the globe (Figure 36.30). One factor in determining species richness is latitude,\nwith the greatest species richness occurring in ecosystems near the equator, which often have warmer temperatures, large\namounts of rainfall, and low seasonality. The lowest species richness occurs near the poles, which are much colder, drier,\nand thus less conducive to life in Geologic time (time since glaciations). The predictability of climate or productivity is\nalso an important factor. Other factors influence species richness as well. For example, the study of island biogeography\nattempts to explain the relatively high species richness found in certain isolated island chains, including the Gal\u00e1pagos\nIslands that inspired the young Darwin. Relative species abundance is the number of individuals in a species relative to the\ntotal number of individuals in all species within a habitat, ecosystem, or biome. Foundation species often have the highest\nrelative abundance of species.\nFigure 36.30 The greatest species richness for mammals in North and South America is associated with the equatorial\nlatitudes. (credit: modification of work by NASA, CIESIN, Columbia University)\nKeystone Species\nA keystone species is one whose presence is key to maintaining biodiversity within an ecosystem and to upholding an\necological community\u2019s structure. The intertidal sea star, Pisaster ochraceus, of the northwestern United States is a keystone\nspecies (Figure 36.31). Studies have shown that when this organism is removed from communities, populations of their\nnatural prey (mussels) increase, completely altering the species composition and reducing biodiversity. Another keystone\nspecies is the banded tetra, a fish in tropical streams, which supplies nearly all of the phosphorus, a necessary inorganic\nnutrient, to the rest of the community. If these fish were to become extinct, the community would be greatly affected.\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1631\nFigure 36.31 The Pisaster ochraceus sea star is a keystone species.

Many such species exist in the United States, as shown in\nFigure 36.32. Whether enjoying a forest hike, taking a summer boat trip, or simply walking down an urban\nstreet, you have likely encountered an invasive species.\nFigure 36.32 In the United States, invasive species like (a) purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) and the (b) zebra\nmussel (Dreissena polymorpha) threaten certain aquatic ecosystems. Some forests are threatened by the spread\nof (c) common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica), (d) garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), and (e) the emerald ash\nborer (Agrilus planipennis). The (f) European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) may compete with native bird species for\nnest holes. (credit a: modification of work by Liz West; credit b: modification of work by M. McCormick, NOAA;\ncredit c: modification of work by E. Dronkert; credit d: modification of work by Dan Davison; credit e: modification\nof work by USDA; credit f: modification of work by Don DeBold)\nOne of the many recent proliferations of an invasive species concerns the growth of Asian carp populations.\nAsian carp were introduced to the United States in the 1970s by fisheries and sewage treatment facilities\nthat used the fish\u2019s excellent filter feeding capabilities to clean their ponds of excess plankton. Some of\nthe fish escaped, however, and by the 1980s they had colonized many waterways of the Mississippi River\nbasin, including the Illinois and Missouri Rivers.\nVoracious eaters and rapid reproducers, Asian carp may outcompete native species for food, potentially\nleading to their extinction. For example, black carp are voracious eaters of native mussels and snails,\nlimiting this food source for native fish species. Silver carp eat plankton that native mussels and snails\nfeed on, reducing this food source by a different alteration of the food web. In some areas of the\nMississippi River, Asian carp species have become the most predominant, effectively outcompeting native\nfishes for habitat. In some parts of the Illinois River, Asian carp constitute 95 percent of the community's\nbiomass. Although edible, the fish is bony and not a desired food in the United States. Moreover, their\npresence threatens the native fish and fisheries of the Great Lakes, which are important to local economies\nand recreational anglers. Asian carp have even injured humans. The fish, frightened by the sound of\napproaching motorboats, thrust themselves into the air, often landing in the boat or directly hitting the\nboaters.\nThe Great Lakes and their prized salmon and lake trout fisheries are also being threatened by these invasive\nfish. Asian carp have already colonized rivers and canals that lead into Lake Michigan. One infested\nwaterway of particular importance is the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Channel, the major supply waterway\nlinking the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River. To prevent the Asian carp from leaving the canal, a series of\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1633\nelectric barriers have been successfully used to discourage their migration; however, the threat is significant\nenough that several states and Canada have sued to have the Chicago channel permanently cut off from\nLake Michigan. Local and national politicians have weighed in on how to solve the problem, but no one\nknows whether the Asian carp will ultimately be considered a nuisance, like other invasive species such as\nthe water hyacinth and zebra mussel, or whether it will be the destroyer of the largest freshwater fishery of\nthe world.\nThe issues associated with Asian carp show how population and community ecology, fisheries\nmanagement, and politics intersect on issues of vital importance to the human food supply and economy.\nSocio-political issues like this make extensive use of the sciences of population ecology (the study of\nmembers of a particular species occupying a particular area known as a habitat) and community ecology\n(the study of the interaction of all species within a habitat).\nWhy are invasive species such as the Asian carp such a problem in North America?\na.\nThey release some chemicals into the water which are toxic to the flora and fauna of the freshwater habitats\nin North America.\nb.\nThey kill the natural fish population native to freshwater habitats in North America by obtaining food from\nthem. The invasive species will then reproduce rapidly.\nc.\nThey provide food and other resources to the native fish population, resulting in an over increase in their\npopulation. This decreases the amount of dissolved oxygen in the freshwater habitats of North America.\nd.\nThey are not native to freshwater habitats in North America and have no natural predators to keep their\npopulation in check. As a result, they will reproduce rapidly competing with native fish for space, food, and\nother resources.\nCommunity Dynamics\nCommunity dynamics are the changes in community structure and composition over time. Sometimes these changes are\ninduced by environmental disturbances such as volcanoes, earthquakes, storms, fires, and climate change. Communities\nwith a stable structure are said to be at equilibrium. Following a disturbance, the community may or may not return to the\nequilibrium state.\nSuccession describes the sequential appearance and disappearance of species in a community over time. In primary\nsuccession, newly exposed or newly formed land is colonized by living things; in secondary succession, part of an\necosystem is disturbed and remnants of the previous community remain.\nPrimary Succession and Pioneer Species\nPrimary succession occurs when new land is formed or rock is exposed: for example, following the eruption of volcanoes,\nsuch as those on the Big Island of Hawaii. As lava flows into the ocean, new land is continually being formed. On the\nBig Island, approximately 32 acres of land is added each year. First, weathering and other natural forces break down the\nsubstrate enough for the establishment of certain hearty plants and lichens with few soil requirements, known as pioneer\nspecies (Figure 36.33). These species help to further break down the mineral rich lava into soil where other, less hardy\nspecies will grow and eventually replace the pioneer species. In addition, as these early species grow and die, they add to\nan ever-growing layer of decomposing organic material and contribute to soil formation. Over time the area will reach an\nequilibrium state, with a set of organisms quite different from the pioneer species.\n1634\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 36.33 During primary succession in lava on Maui, Hawaii, succulent plants are the pioneer species. (credit:\nForest and Kim Starr)\nSecondary Succession\nA classic example of secondary succession occurs in oak and hickory forests cleared by wildfire (Figure 36.34). Wildfires\nwill burn most vegetation and kill those animals unable to flee the area. Their nutrients, however, are returned to the ground\nin the form of ash. Thus, even when areas are devoid of life due to severe fires, the area will soon be ready for new life to\ntake hold.\nBefore the fire, the vegetation was dominated by tall trees with access to the major plant energy resource: sunlight. Their\nheight gave them access to sunlight while also shading the ground and other low-lying species. After the fire, though, these\ntrees are no longer dominant. Thus, the first plants to grow back are usually annual plants followed within a few years\nby quickly growing and spreading grasses and other pioneer species. Due to, at least in part, changes in the environment\nbrought on by the growth of the grasses and other species, over many years, shrubs will emerge along with small pine,\noak, and hickory trees. These organisms are called intermediate species. Eventually, over 150 years, the forest will reach\nits equilibrium point where species composition is no longer changing and resembles the community before the fire. This\nequilibrium state is referred to as the climax community, which will remain stable until the next disturbance.\nFigure 36.34 Secondary succession is shown in an oak and hickory forest after a forest fire.\nActivity\nDon\u2019t Trash the Campus.

        "summary": "Community ecology examines the interactions between different species within a shared habitat, focusing on how these relationships shape population dynamics, community structure, and biodiversity. Key interactions include predator-prey and herbivore-plant relationships, with species evolving various defenses such as mechanical structures, chemical toxins, camouflage, warning coloration, and mimicry (Batesian, M\u00fcllerian, and rare Emsleyan/Mertensian). The competitive exclusion principle states that species competing for identical resources cannot coexist, though resource partitioning can enable coexistence.

The idea that behaviors evolved\nas a result of the pressures of natural selection is not new. Animal behavior has been studied for decades, by biologists in the\nscience of ethology, by psychologists in the science of comparative psychology, and by scientists of many disciplines in the\nstudy of neurobiology. Although there is overlap between these disciplines, scientists in these behavioral fields take different\napproaches. Comparative psychology is an extension of work done in human and behavioral psychology. Ethology is an\nextension of genetics, evolution, anatomy, physiology, and other biological disciplines. Still, one cannot study behavioral\nbiology without touching on both comparative psychology and ethology.\nOne goal of behavioral biology is to dissect out the innate behaviors, which have a strong genetic component and are largely\nindependent of environmental influences, from the learned behaviors, which result from environmental conditioning. Innate\nbehavior, or instinct, is important because there is no risk of an incorrect behavior being learned. They are \u201chard wired\u201d into\nthe system. On the other hand, learned behaviors, although riskier, are flexible, dynamic, and can be altered according to\nchanges in the environment.\nInnate Behaviors: Movement and Migration\nInnate or instinctual behaviors rely on response to stimuli. The simplest example of this is a reflex action, an involuntary\nand rapid response to stimulus. To test the \u201cknee-jerk\u201d reflex, a doctor taps the patellar tendon below the kneecap with a\nrubber hammer. The stimulation of the nerves there leads to the reflex of extending the leg at the knee. This is similar to\nthe reaction of someone who touches a hot stove and instinctually pulls his or her hand away. Even humans, with our great\ncapacity to learn, still exhibit a variety of innate behaviors.\nKinesis and Taxis\nAnother activity or movement of innate behavior is kinesis, or the undirected movement in response to a stimulus.\nOrthokinesis is the increased or decreased speed of movement of an organism in response to a stimulus. Woodlice, for\nexample, increase their speed of movement when exposed to high or low temperatures. This movement, although random,\nincreases the probability that the insect spends less time in the unfavorable environment. Another example is klinokinesis,\nan increase in turning behaviors. It is exhibited by bacteria such as E. coli which, in association with orthokinesis, helps the\norganisms randomly find a more hospitable environment.\nA similar, but more directed version of kinesis is taxis: the directed movement towards or away from a stimulus. This\nmovement can be in response to light (phototaxis), chemical signals (chemotaxis), or gravity (geotaxis) and can be directed\ntoward (positive) or away (negative) from the source of the stimulus. An example of a positive chemotaxis is exhibited by\nthe unicellular protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila. This organism swims using its cilia, at times moving in a straight line,\nand at other times making turns. The attracting chemotactic agent alters the frequency of turning as the organism moves\ndirectly toward the source, following the increasing concentration gradient.\nFixed Action Patterns\nA fixed action pattern is a series of movements elicited by a stimulus such that even when the stimulus is removed, the\npattern goes on to completion. An example of such a behavior occurs in the three-spined stickleback, a small freshwater\nfish (Figure 36.35). Males of this species develop a red belly during breeding season and show instinctual aggressiveness\nto other males during this time. In laboratory experiments, researchers exposed such fish to objects that in no way resemble\na fish in their shape, but which were painted red on their lower halves. The male sticklebacks responded aggressively to the\nobjects just as if they were real male sticklebacks.\n1638\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 36.35 Male three-spined stickleback fish exhibit a fixed action pattern. During mating season, the males, which\ndevelop a bright red belly, react strongly to red-bottomed objects that in no way resemble fish.\nMigration\nMigration is the long-range seasonal movement of animals. It is an evolved, adapted response to variation in resource\navailability, and it is a common phenomenon found in all major groups of animals. Birds fly south for the winter to get to\nwarmer climates with sufficient food, and salmon migrate to their spawning grounds. The popular 2005 documentary March\nof the Penguins followed the 62-mile migration of emperor penguins through Antarctica to bring food back to their breeding\nsite and to their young. Wildebeests (Figure 36.36) migrate over 1800 miles each year in search of new grasslands.\nFigure 36.36 Wildebeests migrate in a clockwise fashion over 1800 miles each year in search of rain-ripened grass.\n(credit: Eric Inafuku)\nAlthough migration is thought of as innate behavior, only some migrating species always migrate (obligate migration).\nAnimals that exhibit facultative migration can choose to migrate or not. Additionally, in some animals, only a portion of\nthe population migrates, whereas the rest does not migrate (incomplete migration). For example, owls that live in the tundra\nmay migrate in years when their food source, small rodents, is relatively scarce, but not migrate during the years when\nrodents are plentiful.\nForaging\nForaging is the act of searching for and exploiting food resources. Feeding behaviors that maximize energy gain and\nminimize energy expenditure are called optimal foraging behaviors, and these are favored by natural section. The painted\nstork, for example, uses its long beak to search the bottom of a freshwater marshland for crabs and other food (Figure\n36.37).\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1639\nFigure 36.37 The painted stork uses its long beak to forage. (credit: J.M. Garg)\nInnate Behaviors: Living in Groups\nNot all animals live in groups, but even those that live relatively solitary lives, with the exception of those that can\nreproduce asexually, must mate. Mating usually involves one animal signaling another so as to communicate the desire to\nmate. There are several types of energy-intensive behaviors or displays associated with mating, called mating rituals. Other\nbehaviors found in populations that live in groups are described in terms of which animal benefits from the behavior. In\nselfish behavior, only the animal in question benefits; in altruistic behavior, one animal\u2019s actions benefit another animal;\ncooperative behavior describes when both animals benefit. All of these behaviors involve some sort of communication\nbetween population members.\nCommunication within a Species\nAnimals communicate with each other using stimuli known as signals. An example of this is seen in the three-spined\nstickleback, where the visual signal of a red region in the lower half of a fish signals males to become aggressive and signals\nfemales to mate. Other signals are chemical (pheromones), aural (sound), visual (courtship and aggressive displays), or\ntactile (touch). These types of communication may be instinctual or learned or a combination of both. These are not the\nsame as the communication we associate with language, which has been observed only in humans and perhaps in some\nspecies of primates and cetaceans.\nA pheromone is a secreted chemical signal used to obtain a response from another individual of the same species. The\npurpose of pheromones is to elicit a specific behavior from the receiving individual. Pheromones are especially common\namong social insects, but they are used by many species to attract the opposite sex, to sound alarms, to mark food trails,\nand to elicit other, more complex behaviors. Even humans are thought to respond to certain pheromones called axillary\nsteroids. These chemicals influence human perception of other people, and in one study were responsible for a group of\nwomen synchronizing their menstrual cycles. The role of pheromones in human-to-human communication is still somewhat\ncontroversial and continues to be researched.\nSongs are an example of an aural signal, one that needs to be heard by the recipient. Perhaps the best known of these are\nsongs of birds, which identify the species and are used to attract mates. Other well-known songs are those of whales, which\nare of such low frequency that they can travel long distances underwater. Dolphins communicate with each other using a\nwide variety of vocalizations. Male crickets make chirping sounds using a specialized organ to attract a mate, repel other\nmales, and to announce a successful mating.\nCourtship displays are a series of ritualized visual behaviors (signals) designed to attract and convince a member of the\nopposite sex to mate. These displays are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom. Often these displays involve a series of steps,\nincluding an initial display by one member followed by a response from the other. If at any point, the display is performed\nincorrectly or a proper response is not given, the mating ritual is abandoned and the mating attempt will be unsuccessful.\nThe mating display of the common stork is shown in Figure 36.38.\nAggressive displays are also common in the animal kingdom. An example is when a dog bares its teeth when it wants\nanother dog to back down. Presumably, these displays communicate not only the willingness of the animal to fight, but also\nits fighting ability. Although these displays do signal aggression on the part of the sender, it is thought that these displays\nare actually a mechanism to reduce the amount of actual fighting that occurs between members of the same species: they\nallow individuals to assess the fighting ability of their opponent and thus decide whether it is \u201cworth the fight.\u201d The testing\nof certain hypotheses using game theory has led to the conclusion that some of these displays may overstate an animal\u2019s\nactual fighting ability and are used to \u201cbluff\u201d the opponent. This type of interaction, even if \u201cdishonest,\u201d would be favored\nby natural selection if it is successful more times than not.\n1640\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 36.38 This stork\u2019s courtship display is designed to attract potential mates. (credit: Linda \u201cjinterwas\u201d/Flickr)\nDistraction displays are seen in birds and some fish. They are designed to attract a predator away from the nest that\ncontains their young. This is an example of an altruistic behavior: it benefits the young more than the individual performing\nthe display, which is putting itself at risk by doing so.\nMany animals, especially primates, communicate with other members in the group through touch. Activities such as\ngrooming, touching the shoulder or root of the tail, embracing, lip contact, and greeting ceremonies have all been observed\nin the Indian langur, an Old World monkey. Similar behaviors are found in other primates, especially in the great apes.\nThe\nkilldeer\nbird\ndistracts\npredators\nfrom\nits\neggs\nby\nfaking\na\nbroken\nwing\ndisplay\nin\nthis\nvideo\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/killdeer_bird) taken in Boise, Idaho.\nExplain why the behavior shown in the video represents both a distraction display and an altruistic type of behavior.\na.\nThe parent creates a distraction to attract the predator away from young fledgling by pretending to have a\nbroken wing.

It is exhibiting an altruistic behavior as in saving its fledgling; it is increasing its own fitness along\nwith the fitness of the young bird.\nd.\nParent creates distraction by being more aggressive and showing its willingness to fight. It is exhibiting an\naltruistic behavior by saving its fledgling; it is decreasing its own fitness along with the fitness of the young\nbird.\nAltruistic Behaviors\nBehaviors that lower the fitness of the individual but increase the fitness of another individual are termed altruistic.\nExamples of such behaviors are seen widely across the animal kingdom. Social insects such as worker bees have no ability\nto reproduce, yet they maintain the queen so she can populate the hive with her offspring. Meerkats keep a sentry standing\nguard to warn the rest of the colony about intruders, even though the sentry is putting itself at risk. Wolves and wild dogs\nbring meat to pack members not present during a hunt. Lemurs take care of infants unrelated to them. Although on the\nsurface, these behaviors appear to be altruistic, it may not be so simple.\nThere has been much discussion over why altruistic behaviors exist. Do these behaviors lead to overall evolutionary\nadvantages for their species? Do they help the altruistic individual pass on its own genes? And what about such activities\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1641\nbetween unrelated individuals? One explanation for altruistic-type behaviors is found in the genetics of natural selection. In\nthe 1976 book, The Selfish Gene, scientist Richard Dawkins attempted to explain many seemingly altruistic behaviors from\nthe viewpoint of the gene itself. Although a gene obviously cannot be selfish in the human sense, it may appear that way if\nthe sacrifice of an individual benefits related individuals that share genes that are identical by descent (present in relatives\nbecause of common lineage). Mammal parents make this sacrifice to take care of their offspring. Emperor penguins migrate\nmiles in harsh conditions to bring food back for their young. Selfish gene theory has been controversial over the years and\nis still discussed among scientists in related fields.\nEven less-related individuals, those with less genetic identity than that shared by parent and offspring, benefit from\nseemingly altruistic behavior. The activities of social insects such as bees, wasps, ants, and termites are good examples.\nSterile workers in these societies take care of the queen because they are closely related to it, and as the queen has offspring,\nshe is passing on genes from the workers indirectly. Thus, it is of fitness benefit for the worker to maintain the queen\nwithout having any direct chance of passing on its genes due to its sterility. The lowering of individual fitness to enhance\nthe reproductive fitness of a relative and thus one\u2019s inclusive fitness evolves through kin selection. This phenomenon\ncan explain many superficially altruistic behaviors seen in animals. However, these behaviors may not be truly defined as\naltruism in these cases because the actor is actually increasing its own fitness either directly (through its own offspring) or\nindirectly (through the inclusive fitness it gains through relatives that share genes with it).\nUnrelated individuals may also act altruistically to each other, and this seems to defy the \u201cselfish gene\u201d explanation. An\nexample of this observed in many monkey species where a monkey will present its back to an unrelated monkey to have that\nindividual pick the parasites from its fur. After a certain amount of time, the roles are reversed and the first monkey now\ngrooms the second monkey. Thus, there is reciprocity in the behavior. Both benefit from the interaction and their fitness\nis raised more than if neither cooperated nor if one cooperated and the other did not cooperate. This behavior is still not\nnecessarily altruism, as the \u201cgiving\u201d behavior of the actor is based on the expectation that it will be the \u201creceiver\u201d of the\nbehavior in the future, termed reciprocal altruism. Reciprocal altruism requires that individuals repeatedly encounter each\nother, often the result of living in the same social group, and that cheaters (those that never \u201cgive back\u201d) are punished.\nEvolutionary game theory, a modification of classical game theory in mathematics, has shown that many of these so-called\n\u201caltruistic behaviors\u201d are not altruistic at all. The definition of \u201cpure\u201d altruism, based on human behavior, is an action that\nbenefits another without any direct benefit to oneself. Most of the behaviors previously described do not seem to satisfy this\ndefinition, and game theorists are good at finding \u201cselfish\u201d components in them. Others have argued that the terms \u201cselfish\u201d\nand \u201caltruistic\u201d should be dropped completely when discussing animal behavior, as they describe human behavior and may\nnot be directly applicable to instinctual animal activity. What is clear, though, is that heritable behaviors that improve the\nchances of passing on one\u2019s genes or a portion of one\u2019s genes are favored by natural selection and will be retained in future\ngenerations as long as those behaviors convey a fitness advantage. These instinctual behaviors may then be applied, in\nspecial circumstances, to other species, as long as it doesn\u2019t lower the animal\u2019s fitness.\nFinding Sex Partners\nNot all animals reproduce sexually, but many that do have the same challenge: they need to find a suitable mate and often\nhave to compete with other individuals to obtain one. Significant energy is spent in the process of locating, attracting, and\nmating with the sex partner. Two types of selection occur during this process and can lead to traits that are important to\nreproduction called secondary sexual characteristics: intersexual selection, the choosing of a mate where individuals of\none sex choose mates of the other sex, and intrasexual selection, the competition for mates between species members of\nthe same sex. Intersexual selection is often complex because choosing a mate may be based on a variety of visual, aural,\ntactile, and chemical cues. An example of intersexual selection is when female peacocks choose to mate with the male\nwith the brightest plumage. This type of selection often leads to traits in the chosen sex that do not enhance survival, but\nare those traits most attractive to the opposite sex (often at the expense of survival). Intrasexual selection involves mating\ndisplays and aggressive mating rituals such as rams butting heads\u2014the winner of these battles is the one that is able to\nmate. Many of these rituals use up considerable energy but result in the selection of the healthiest, strongest, and/or most\ndominant individuals for mating. Three general mating systems, all involving innate as opposed to learned behaviors, are\nseen in animal populations: monogamous, polygynous, and polyandrous.\n1642\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nVisit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/sex_selection) for informative videos on sexual selection.\nThe greater sage grouse uses a mating system in which one male mates with many females.

Some of these guppies have brighter coloration than others. Endler hypothesized that guppies\nwith less predation have brighter colors due to sexual selection because females prefer more brightly-\ncolored males. He then on to hypothesized that male guppies that experience greater predation become\nmore drab-colored to camouflage themselves from predators.. In addition to a laboratory study, he tested\nthis using a field experiment involving four areas. Area 1 had no guppies while area 2 had guppies but no\npredators. Area 3 had guppies and a predator (Crenicichla alta). Endler introduced guppies from area 3\n(which were drab because of predation) to area 1 (which had no guppies). The guppies that were relocated\nto area 1 developed brighter colors over 2 years (enough for several guppy generations) and eventually\nresembled the guppies in area 2. Make a diagram showing each of the locations, all of the fish species\npresent at the start, and the fish present at the end. Label the fish as \u201cmore conspicuous colors\u201d or \u201cless\nconspicuous colors.\u201d\nThink About It\nDescribe how this experiment shows that there is genetic variability in the original population. How do you know that\nthere was genetic variability in the fish taken from area 1? Explain the tradeoff between bright colors that are attractive\nto female guppies and the risk of predation. What would you expect to happen if you moved fish from area 2 back\nto area 3? What would you expect to happen in each area if female fish began to prefer larger fish rather than more\nbrightly colored fish?\nIn monogamous systems, one male and one female are paired for at least one breeding season. In some animals, such as the\ngray wolf, these associations can last much longer, even a lifetime. Several explanations have been proposed for this type of\nmating system. The \u201cmate-guarding hypothesis\u201d states that males stay with the female to prevent other males from mating\nwith her. This behavior is advantageous in such situations where mates are scarce and difficult to find. Another explanation\nis the \u201cmale-assistance hypothesis,\u201d where males that remain with a female to help guard and rear their young will have\nmore and healthier offspring. Monogamy is observed in many bird populations where, in addition to the parental care\nfrom the female, the male is also a major provider of parental care for the chicks. A third explanation for the evolutionary\nadvantages of monogamy is the \u201cfemale-enforcement hypothesis.\u201d In this scenario, the female ensures that the male does\nnot have other offspring that might compete with her own, so she actively interferes with the male\u2019s signaling to attract\nother mates.\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1643\nPolygynous mating refers to one male mating with multiple females. In these situations, the female must be responsible\nfor most of the parental care as the single male is not capable of providing care to that many offspring. In resourced-based\npolygyny, males compete for territories with the best resources, and then mate with females that enter the territory, drawn\nto its resource richness. The female benefits by mating with a dominant, genetically fit male; however, it is at the cost of\nhaving no male help in caring for the offspring. An example is seen in the yellow-rumped honeyguide, a bird whose males\ndefend beehives because the females feed on their wax. As the females approach, the male defending the nest will mate with\nthem. Harem mating structures are a type of polygynous system where certain males dominate mating while controlling\na territory with resources. Elephant seals, where the alpha male dominates the mating within the group are an example.\nA third type of polygyny is a lek system. Here there is a communal courting area where several males perform elaborate\ndisplays for females, and the females choose their mate from this group. This behavior is observed in several bird species\nincluding the sage grouse and the prairie chicken.\nIn polyandrous mating systems, one female mates with many males. These types of systems are much rarer than\nmonogamous and polygynous mating systems. In pipefishes and seahorses, males receive the eggs from the female, fertilize\nthem, protect them within a pouch, and give birth to the offspring (Figure 36.39). Therefore, the female is able to provide\neggs to several males without the burden of carrying the fertilized eggs.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 36.39 Polyandrous mating, in which one female mates with many males, occurs in the (a) seahorse and the (b)\npipefish. (credit a: modification of work by Brian Gratwicke; credit b: modification of work by Stephen Childs)\nSimple Learned Behaviors\nThe majority of the behaviors previously discussed were innate or at least have an innate component (variations on\nthe innate behaviors may be learned). They are inherited and the behaviors do not change in response to signals from\nthe environment. Conversely, learned behaviors, even though they may have instinctive components, allow an organism\nto adapt to changes in the environment and are modified by previous experiences. Simple learned behaviors include\nhabituation and imprinting\u2014both are important to the maturation process of young animals.\nHabituation\nHabituation is a simple form of learning in which an animal stops responding to a stimulus after a period of repeated\nexposure. This is a form of non-associative learning, as the stimulus is not associated with any punishment or reward.\nPrairie dogs typically sound an alarm call when threatened by a predator, but they become habituated to the sound of human\nfootsteps when no harm is associated with this sound, therefore, they no longer respond to them with an alarm call. In this\nexample, habituation is specific to the sound of human footsteps, as the animals still respond to the sounds of potential\npredators.\nImprinting\nImprinting is a type of learning that occurs at a particular age or a life stage that is rapid and independent of the species\ninvolved. Hatchling ducks recognize the first adult they see, their mother, and make a bond with her. A familiar sight is\nducklings walking or swimming after their mothers (Figure 36.40). This is another type of non-associative learning, but\nis very important in the maturation process of these animals as it encourages them to stay near their mother so they will\nbe protected, greatly increasing their chances of survival. However, if newborn ducks see a human before they see their\nmother, they will imprint on the human and follow it in just the same manner as they would follow their real mother.\n1644\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 36.40 The attachment of ducklings to their mother is an example of imprinting. (credit: modification of work by\nMark Harkin)\nThe International Crane Foundation has helped raise the world\u2019s population of whooping cranes from 21 individuals to\nabout 600. Imprinting hatchlings has been a key to success: biologists wear full crane costumes so the birds never \u201csee\u201d\nhumans. Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/whooping_crane) to learn more.\nWorkers wear a special costume when interacting with whooping crane chicks. Justify the need for this process.\na.\nWhooping crane chicks undergo habituation in which the chicks make a bond with the objects they see in the\nenvironment. Therefore, workers must wear a special costume to fool the chick into thinking it is associating\nwith an adult whooping crane.\nb.\nWhooping crane chicks undergo imprinting with the first object they see. Therefore, workers must wear\na special costume to fool the chick into thinking it is associating with an adult whooping crane to avoid\ncreating the expectation it will mate with a human.\nc.\nWhooping crane chicks undergo imprinting with the first few objects they see. Therefore, workers must wear\na special costume to fool the chick into thinking it is associating with an adult whooping crane to avoid\ncreating the expectation that it will mate with a human.\nd.\nWhooping crane undergoes habituation in which the chicks only make a bond with the first object they see.\nThe young chicks only trust that first object to feed them. Thus workers must wear a special costume to fool\nthe chick into thinking it is associating with an adult whooping crane.\nConditioned Behavior\nConditioned behaviors are types of associative learning, where a stimulus becomes associated with a consequence. During\noperant conditioning, the behavioral response is modified by its consequences, with regards to its form, strength, or\nfrequency.\nClassical Conditioning\nIn classical conditioning, a response called the conditioned response is associated with a stimulus that it had previously\nnot been associated with, the conditioned stimulus. The response to the original, unconditioned stimulus is called the\nunconditioned response. The most cited example of classical conditioning is Ivan Pavlov\u2019s experiments with dogs (Figure\n36.41). In Pavlov\u2019s experiments, the unconditioned response was the salivation of dogs in response to the unconditioned\nstimulus of seeing or smelling their food. The conditioning stimulus that researchers associated with the unconditioned\nresponse was the ringing of a bell. During conditioning, every time the animal was given food, the bell was rung. This was\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1645\nrepeated during several trials. After some time, the dog learned to associate the ringing of the bell with food and to respond\nby salivating. After the conditioning period was finished, the dog would respond by salivating when the bell was rung,\neven when the unconditioned stimulus, the food, was absent. Thus, the ringing of the bell became the conditioned stimulus\nand the salivation became the conditioned response. Although it is thought by some scientists that the unconditioned\nand conditioned responses are identical, even Pavlov discovered that the saliva in the conditioned dogs had characteristic\ndifferences when compared to the unconditioned dog.\nFigure 36.41 In the classic Pavlovian response, the dog becomes conditioned to associate the ringing of the bell with\nfood.\nIt had been thought by some scientists that this type of conditioning required multiple exposures to the paired stimulus\nand response, but it is now known that this is not necessary in all cases, and that some conditioning can be learned in a\nsingle pairing experiment. Classical conditioning is a major tenet of behaviorism, a branch of psychological philosophy that\nproposes that all actions, thoughts, and emotions of living things are behaviors that can be treated by behavior modification\nand changes in the environment.\nOperant Conditioning\nIn operant conditioning, the conditioned behavior is gradually modified by its consequences as the animal responds to the\nstimulus. A major proponent of such conditioning was psychologist B.F. Skinner, the inventor of the Skinner box. Skinner\nput rats in his boxes that contained a lever that would dispense food to the rat when depressed. While initially the rat would\npush the lever a few times by accident, it eventually associated pushing the lever with getting the food. This type of learning\nis an example of operant conditioning. Operant learning is the basis of most animal training. The conditioned behavior\nis continually modified by positive or negative reinforcement, often a reward such as food or some type of punishment,\nrespectively. In this way, the animal is conditioned to associate a type of behavior with the punishment or reward, and, over\ntime, can be induced to perform behaviors that they would not have done in the wild, such as the \u201ctricks\u201d dolphins perform\nat marine amusement park shows (Figure 36.42).\nFigure 36.42 The training of dolphins by rewarding them with food is an example of positive reinforcement operant\nconditioning. (credit: Roland Tanglao)\nCognitive Learning\nClassical and operant conditioning are inefficient ways for humans and other intelligent animals to learn. Some primates,\nincluding humans, are able to learn by imitating the behavior of others and by taking instructions. The development of\ncomplex language by humans has made cognitive learning, the manipulation of information using the mind, the most\nprominent method of human learning. In fact, that is how students are learning right now by reading this book. As students\n1646\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nread, they can make mental images of objects or organisms and imagine changes to them, or behaviors by them, and\nanticipate the consequences. In addition to visual processing, cognitive learning is also enhanced by remembering past\nexperiences, touching physical objects, hearing sounds, tasting food, and a variety of other sensory-based inputs. Cognitive\nlearning is so powerful that it can be used to understand conditioning in detail. In the reverse scenario, conditioning cannot\nhelp someone learn about cognition.\nClassic work on cognitive learning was done by Wolfgang K\u00f6hler with chimpanzees. He demonstrated that these animals\nwere capable of abstract thought by showing that they could learn how to solve a puzzle. When a banana was hung in their\ncage too high for them to reach, and several boxes were placed randomly on the floor, some of the chimps were able to stack\nthe boxes one on top of the other, climb on top of them, and get the banana. This implies that they could visualize the result\nof stacking the boxes even before they had performed the action. This type of learning is much more powerful and versatile\nthan conditioning.\nCognitive learning is not limited to primates, although they are the most efficient in using it. Maze running experiments\ndone with rats by H.C. Blodgett in the 1920s were the first to show cognitive skills in a simple mammal. The motivation for\nthe animals to work their way through the maze was a piece of food at its end. In these studies, the animals in Group I were\nrun in one trial per day and had food available to them each day on completion of the run (Figure 36.43). Group II rats were\nnot fed in the maze for the first six days and then subsequent runs were done with food for several days after. Group III rats\nhad food available on the third day and every day thereafter. The results were that the control rats, Group I, learned quickly,\nand figured out how to run the maze in seven days. Group III did not learn much during the three days without food, but\nrapidly caught up to the control group when given the food reward. Group II learned very slowly for the six days with no\nreward to motivate them, and they did not begin to catch up to the control group until the day food was given, and then it\ntook two days longer to learn the maze.\nFigure 36.43 Group I (the green solid line) found food at the end of each trial, group II (the blue dashed line) did not\nfind food for the first 6 days, and group III (the red dotted line) did not find food during runs on the first three days.\nNotice that rats given food earlier learned faster and eventually caught up to the control group. The orange dots on the\ngroup II and III lines show the days when food rewards were added to the mazes.\nIt may not be immediately obvious that this type of learning is different than conditioning. Although one might be tempted\nto believe that the rats simply learned how to find their way through a conditioned series of right and left turns, E.C. Tolman\nproved a decade later that the rats were making a representation of the maze in their minds, which he called a \u201ccognitive\nmap.\u201d This was an early demonstration of the power of cognitive learning and how these abilities were not just limited to\nhumans.\nSociobiology\nSociobiology is an interdisciplinary science originally popularized by social insect researcher E.O. Wilson in the 1970s.\nWilson defined the science as \u201cthe extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization.\u201d\n[9]The\n9. Edward O. Wilson. On Human Nature (1978; repr., Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2004), xx.\nChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology\n1647\nmain thrust of sociobiology is that animal and human behavior, including aggressiveness and other social interactions, can\nbe explained almost solely in terms of genetics and natural selection. This science is controversial; noted scientists such\nas the late Stephen Jay Gould criticized the approach for ignoring the environmental effects on behavior. This is another\nexample of the \u201cnature versus nurture\u201d debate of the role of genetics versus the role of environment in determining an\norganism\u2019s characteristics.\nSociobiology also links genes with behaviors and has been associated with \u201cbiological determinism,\u201d the belief that all\nbehaviors are hardwired into our genes. No one disputes that certain behaviors can be inherited and that natural selection\nplays a role retaining them. It is the application of such principles to human behavior that sparks this controversy, which\nremains active today.\nLab Investigation\nAP\u00ae Biology Investigative Labs: Inquiry-Based Approach, Investigation 12: Fruit Fly Behavior. This inquiry-\nbased investigation provides an opportunity for you to design and implement a series of experiments\nusing choice chambers to investigate behaviors that underlie directed movement (taxis) towards or away\nfrom environmental stimuli, including chemical signals, light, and temperature, in a small population of\nDrosophila.\nActivity\nAnimal Behavior Field Study\nAnimal behavior can be studied in nearly every environment. Visit a local park, zoo, athletic field, or even\na location on your school campus and observe the behaviors and interactions among different animals\nand with their environment. Consider the following questions in your study: How do animals exchange\ninformation and alter behavior in response to stimuli? What mechanisms do animals use to communicate\ninformation? What examples of innate and learned behaviors did you observe? What predictions can you\nmake about observed behavior(s) if environmental conditions change?\nThink About It\nDescribe how Pavlov\u2019s dog experiments are an example of classical conditioning. How does operant conditioning that\nyou use to train a pet to do a trick differ from classical conditioning? What type of conditioning describes how you\nlearned that studying likely will improve your grade on an AP\u00ae test?\nSection Summary\nBehaviors are responses to stimuli. They can either be instinctual/innate behaviors, which are not influenced by the\nenvironment, or learned behaviors, which are influenced by environmental changes. Instinctual behaviors include mating\nsystems and methods of communication. Learned behaviors include imprinting and habituation, conditioning, and, most\npowerfully, cognitive learning. Although the connection between behavior, genetics, and evolution is well established, the\nexplanation of human behavior as entirely genetic is controversial.\n1648\nChapter 36 | Population and

        "summary": "Behavioral biology examines the biological and evolutionary bases of behavior, distinguishing between innate behaviors, which are genetically hardwired and unaffected by the environment, and learned behaviors, which arise from environmental influences and experience. Innate behaviors include reflexes, kinesis, taxis, fixed action patterns, migration, foraging strategies, communication methods, mating systems, and social interactions such as altruism, cooperation, and aggression. Learned behaviors range from simple forms like habituation and imprinting to associative learning via classical and operant conditioning, and extend to complex cognitive learning involving problem-solving and mental representation. Communication among animals may be visual, chemical, auditory, or tactile, serving purposes like mating, warning, coordination, and group cohesion. Mating strategies\u2014monogamy, polygyny, and polyandry\u2014evolve through sexual selection, involving either competition within a sex or choice between sexes. Social behaviors, including seemingly altruistic acts, can often be explained through kin selection, reciprocal altruism, and evolutionary game theory, with fitness benefits influencing their persistence. The interdisciplinary field of sociobiology links genetics, natural selection, and social organization, though its application to human behavior remains controversial in the nature versus nurture debate."

This disease had an alarming rate of fatalities, killing more than half of early patients, many\nof whom were Native Americans. These formerly healthy young adults died from complete respiratory failure. The disease\nwas unknown, and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the United States government agency responsible for managing\npotential epidemics, was brought in to investigate. The scientists could have learned about the disease had they known\nto talk with the Navajo healers who lived in the area and who had observed the connection between rainfall and mice\npopulations, thereby predicting the 1993 outbreak.\nThe cause of the disease, determined within a few weeks by the CDC investigators, was the hantavirus known as Sin\nNombre, the virus with \u201cno name.\u201d With insights from traditional Navajo medicine, scientists were able to characterize\nthe disease and rapidly and institute effective health measures to prevent its spread.

Other critical factors influencing community dynamics are the components of its physical and geographic\nenvironment: a habitat\u2019s latitude, amount of rainfall, topography (elevation), and available species. These are all important\nenvironmental variables that determine which organisms can exist within a particular area.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 and Big Idea 4\nof the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework.

(credit a: modification of work by \u201ctakomabibelot\u201d/Flickr; credit b: modification\nof work by Ivan Mlinaric)\nThere are three broad categories of ecosystems based on their general environment: freshwater, ocean water, and terrestrial.\nWithin these broad categories are individual ecosystem types based on the organisms present and the type of environmental\nhabitat.\nOcean ecosystems are the most common, comprising 75 percent of the Earth's surface and consisting of three basic types:\nshallow ocean, deep ocean water, and deep ocean surfaces (the low depth areas of the deep oceans). The shallow ocean\necosystems include extremely biodiverse coral reef ecosystems, and the deep ocean surface is known for its large numbers\nof plankton and krill (small crustaceans) that support it. These two environments are especially important to aerobic\nrespirators worldwide as the phytoplankton perform 40 percent of all photosynthesis on Earth. Although not as diverse as\nthe other two, deep ocean ecosystems contain a wide variety of marine organisms. Such ecosystems exist even at the bottom\nof the ocean where light is unable to penetrate through the water.\nFreshwater ecosystems are the rarest, occurring on only 1.8 percent of the Earth's surface. Lakes, rivers, streams, and\nsprings comprise these systems; they are quite diverse, and they support a variety of fish, amphibians, reptiles, insects,\nphytoplankton, fungi, and bacteria.\nTerrestrial ecosystems, also known for their diversity, are grouped into large categories called biomes, such as tropical\nrain forests, savannas, deserts, coniferous forests, deciduous forests, and tundra. Grouping these ecosystems into just a few\nbiome categories obscures the great diversity of the individual ecosystems within them. For example, there is great variation\nin desert vegetation: the saguaro cacti and other plant life in the Sonoran Desert, in the United States, are relatively abundant\ncompared to the desolate rocky desert of Boa Vista, an island off the coast of Western Africa (Figure 37.3).\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\n1685\nFigure 37.3 Desert ecosystems, like all ecosystems, can vary greatly. The desert in (a) Saguaro National Park,\nArizona, has abundant plant life, while the rocky desert of (b) Boa Vista island, Cape Verde, Africa, is devoid of plant\nlife. (credit a: modification of work by Jay Galvin; credit b: modification of work by Ingo W\u00f6lbern)\nEcosystems are complex with many interacting parts. They are routinely exposed to various disturbances, or changes in\nthe environment that effect their compositions: yearly variations in rainfall and temperature and the slower processes of\nplant growth, which may take several years. Many of these disturbances are a result of natural processes. For example,\nwhen lightning causes a forest fire and destroys part of a forest ecosystem, the ground is eventually populated by grasses,\nthen by bushes and shrubs, and later by mature trees, restoring the forest to its former state. The impact of environmental\ndisturbances caused by human activities is as important as the changes wrought by natural processes. Human agricultural\npractices, air pollution, acid rain, global deforestation, overfishing, eutrophication, oil spills, and illegal dumping on land\nand into the ocean are all issues of concern to conservationists.\nEquilibrium is the steady state of an ecosystem where all organisms are in balance with their environment and with each\nother. In ecology, two parameters are used to measure changes in ecosystems: resistance and resilience. The ability of an\necosystem to remain at equilibrium in spite of disturbances is called resistance. The speed at which an ecosystem recovers\nequilibrium after being disturbed, called its resilience. Ecosystem resistance and resilience are especially important when\nconsidering human impact. The nature of an ecosystem may change to such a degree that it can lose its resilience entirely.\nThis process can lead to the complete destruction or irreversible altering of the ecosystem.\nFood Chains and Food Webs\nThe term \u201cfood chain\u201d is sometimes used metaphorically to describe human social situations. In this sense, food chains are\nthought of as a competition for survival, such as \u201cwho eats whom?\u201d Someone eats and someone is eaten. Therefore, it is not\nsurprising that in our competitive \u201cdog-eat-dog\u201d society, individuals who are considered successful are seen as being at the\ntop of the food chain, consuming all others for their benefit, whereas the less successful are seen as being at the bottom.\nThe scientific understanding of a food chain is more precise than in its everyday usage. In ecology, a food chain is a linear\nsequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass: primary producers, primary consumers, and higher-level\nconsumers are used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics. There is a single path through the chain. Each organism\nin a food chain occupies what is called a trophic level. Depending on their role as producers or consumers, species or\ngroups of species can be assigned to various trophic levels.\nIn many ecosystems, the bottom of the food chain consists of photosynthetic organisms (plants and/or phytoplankton),\nwhich are called primary producers. The organisms that consume the primary producers are herbivores: the primary\nconsumers. Secondary consumers are usually carnivores that eat the primary consumers. Tertiary consumers are\ncarnivores that eat other carnivores. Higher-level consumers feed on the next lower tropic levels, and so on, up to the\norganisms at the top of the food chain: the apex consumers. In the Lake Ontario food chain shown in Figure 37.4, the\nChinook salmon is the apex consumer at the top of this food chain.\n1686\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 37.4 These are the trophic levels of a food chain in Lake Ontario at the United States-Canada border. Energy\nand nutrients flow from photosynthetic green algae at the bottom to the top of the food chain: the Chinook salmon.\nOne major factor that limits the length of food chains is energy. Energy is lost as heat between each trophic level due to the\nsecond law of thermodynamics. Thus, after a limited number of trophic energy transfers, the amount of energy remaining\nin the food chain may not be great enough to support viable populations at yet a higher trophic level.\nThe loss of energy between trophic levels is illustrated by the pioneering studies of Howard T. Odum in the Silver Springs,\nFlorida, ecosystem in the 1940s (Figure 37.5). The primary producers generated 20,819 kcal/m2/yr (kilocalories per square\nmeter per year), the primary consumers generated 3368 kcal/m2/yr, the secondary consumers generated 383 kcal/m2/yr, and\nthe tertiary consumers only generated 21 kcal/m2/yr. Thus, there is little energy remaining for another level of consumers in\nthis ecosystem.\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\n1687\nFigure 37.5 The relative energy in trophic levels in a Silver Springs, Florida, ecosystem is shown. Each trophic level\nhas less energy available and supports fewer organisms at the next level.\nThere is a problem when using food chains to accurately describe most ecosystems. Even when all organisms are grouped\ninto appropriate trophic levels, some of these organisms can feed on species from more than one trophic level; likewise,\nsome of these organisms can be eaten by species from multiple trophic levels. In other words, the linear model of\necosystems, the food chain, is not completely descriptive of ecosystem structure. A holistic model\u2014which accounts for\nall the interactions between different species and their complex interconnected relationships with each other and with the\nenvironment\u2014is a more accurate and descriptive model for ecosystems. A food web is a graphic representation of a holistic,\nnon-linear web of primary producers, primary consumers, and higher-level consumers used to describe ecosystem structure\nand dynamics (Figure 37.6).\nFigure 37.6 This food web shows the interactions between organisms across trophic levels in the Lake Ontario\necosystem. Primary producers are outlined in green, primary consumers in orange, secondary consumers in blue, and\ntertiary (apex) consumers in purple. Arrows point from an organism that is consumed to the organism that consumes\nit. Notice how some lines point to more than one trophic level. For example, the opossum shrimp eats both primary\nproducers and primary consumers. (credit: NOAA, GLERL)\nA comparison of the two types of structural ecosystem models shows strength in both. Food chains are more flexible for\nanalytical modeling, are easier to follow, and are easier to experiment with, whereas food web models more accurately\nrepresent ecosystem structure and dynamics, and data can be directly used as input for simulation modeling.\n1688\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nHead to this online interactive simulator (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/food_web) to investigate food web function.

When you are ready to create a simulation, in the upper-right corner of the Interactive Labs box, click OPEN\nSIMULATOR.\nWhat happens to a food web in the absence of primary producers such as plants? Why?\na.\nA food web will be produced, but position of some organisms will vary in the food web as their diet will\nvary.\nb.\nSome primary consumers will perform the function of primary producers in the food web or chain.\nc.\nA food web is unable to be produced as there is no basal energy source for consumers to obtain energy from.\nd.\nA food web is unable to be produced because very less amount of basal energy source is available for\nconsumers to obtain energy from.\nTwo general types of food webs are often shown interacting within a single ecosystem. A grazing food web (such as the\nLake Ontario food web in Figure 37.6) has plants or other photosynthetic organisms at its base, followed by herbivores\nand various carnivores. A detrital food web consists of a base of organisms that feed on decaying organic matter (dead\norganisms), called decomposers or detritivores. These organisms are usually bacteria or fungi that recycle organic material\nback into the biotic part of the ecosystem as they themselves are consumed by other organisms. As all ecosystems require\na method to recycle material from dead organisms, most grazing food webs have an associated detrital food web. For\nexample, in a meadow ecosystem, plants may support a grazing food web of different organisms, primary and other levels\nof consumers, while at the same time supporting a detrital food web of bacteria, fungi, and detrivorous invertebrates feeding\noff dead plants and animals.\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\n1689\nThree-spined Stickleback\nIt is well established by the theory of natural selection that changes in the environment play a major role in\nthe evolution of species within an ecosystem. However, little is known about how the evolution of species\nwithin an ecosystem can alter the ecosystem environment. In 2009, Dr. Luke Harmon, from the University\nof Idaho in Moscow, published a paper that for the first time showed that the evolution of organisms into\nsubspecies can have direct effects on their ecosystem environment.\n[1]\nThe three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a freshwater fish that evolved from a saltwater fish\nto live in freshwater lakes about 10,000 years ago, which is considered a recent development in evolutionary\ntime (Figure 37.7). Over the last 10,000 years, these freshwater fish then became isolated from each other\nin different lakes. Depending on which lake population was studied, findings showed that these sticklebacks\nthen either remained as one species or evolved into two species. The divergence of species was made\npossible by their use of different areas of the pond for feeding called micro niches.\nDr. Harmon and his team created artificial pond microcosms in 250-gallon tanks and added muck from\nfreshwater ponds as a source of zooplankton and other invertebrates to sustain the fish. In different\nexperimental tanks they introduced one species of stickleback from either a single-species or double-\nspecies lake.\nOver time, the team observed that some of the tanks bloomed with algae while others did not. This puzzled\nthe scientists, and they decided to measure the water's dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which consists of\nmostly large molecules of decaying organic matter that give pond-water its slightly brownish color. It turned\nout that the water from the tanks with two-species fish contained larger particles of DOC (and hence darker\nwater) than water with single-species fish. This increase in DOC blocked the sunlight and prevented algal\nblooming. Conversely, the water from the single-species tank contained smaller DOC particles, allowing\nmore sunlight penetration to fuel the algal blooms.\nThis change in the environment, which is due to the different feeding habits of the stickleback species in\neach lake type, probably has a great impact on the survival of other species in these ecosystems, especially\nother photosynthetic organisms. Thus, the study shows that, at least in these ecosystems, the environment\nand the evolution of populations have reciprocal effects that may now be factored into simulation models.\nFigure 37.7 The three-spined stickleback evolved from a saltwater fish to freshwater fish. (credit: Barrett Paul,\nUSFWS)\nIn the lake microcosms, why were algal blooms possible in the presence of one, but not two stickleback species?\na.\nBecause there were larger molecules of dissolved organic content in the presence of two species versus one\nspecies.\nb.\nBecause two stickleback species consume all of the nutrients required by the algae to bloom.\nc.\nBecause one species had more dissolved organic matter available in their habitat than the other species.\nd.\nBecause more algae is consumed in the presence of two stickleback species versus only one species.\n1690\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nResearch into Ecosystem Dynamics: Ecosystem Experimentation and\nModeling\nThe study of the changes in ecosystem structure caused by changes in the environment (disturbances) or by internal forces\nis called ecosystem dynamics. Ecosystems are characterized using a variety of research methodologies. Some ecologists\nstudy ecosystems using controlled experimental systems, while some study entire ecosystems in their natural state, and\nothers use both approaches.\nA holistic ecosystem model attempts to quantify the composition, interaction, and dynamics of entire ecosystems; it is the\nmost representative of the ecosystem in its natural state. A food web is an example of a holistic ecosystem model. However,\nthis type of study is limited by time and expense, as well as the fact that it is neither feasible nor ethical to do experiments\non large natural ecosystems. To quantify all different species in an ecosystem and the dynamics in their habitat is difficult,\nespecially when studying large habitats such as the Amazon Rainforest, which covers 1.4 billion acres (5.5 million km2) of\nthe Earth\u2019s surface.\nFor these reasons, scientists study ecosystems under more controlled conditions. Experimental systems usually involve\neither partitioning a part of a natural ecosystem that can be used for experiments, termed a mesocosm, or by re-creating an\necosystem entirely in an indoor or outdoor laboratory environment, which is referred to as a microcosm. A major limitation\nto these approaches is that removing individual organisms from their natural ecosystem or altering a natural ecosystem\nthrough partitioning may change the dynamics of the ecosystem. These changes are often due to differences in species\nnumbers and diversity and also to environment alterations caused by partitioning (mesocosm) or re-creating (microcosm)\nthe natural habitat. Thus, these types of experiments are not totally predictive of changes that would occur in the ecosystem\nfrom which they were gathered.\nAs both of these approaches have their limitations, some ecologists suggest that results from these experimental systems\nshould be used only in conjunction with holistic ecosystem studies to obtain the most representative data about ecosystem\nstructure, function, and dynamics.\nScientists use the data generated by these experimental studies to develop ecosystem models that demonstrate the structure\nand dynamics of ecosystems. Three basic types of ecosystem modeling are routinely used in research and ecosystem\nmanagement: a conceptual model, an analytical model, and a simulation model. A conceptual model is an ecosystem model\nthat consists of flow charts to show interactions of different compartments of the living and nonliving components of the\necosystem. A conceptual model describes ecosystem structure and dynamics and shows how environmental disturbances\naffect the ecosystem; however, its ability to predict the effects of these disturbances is limited. Analytical and simulation\nmodels, in contrast, are mathematical methods of describing ecosystems that are indeed capable of predicting the effects\nof potential environmental changes without direct experimentation, although with some limitations as to accuracy. An\nanalytical model is an ecosystem model that is created using simple mathematical formulas to predict the effects of\nenvironmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics. A simulation model is an ecosystem model that is\ncreated using complex computer algorithms to holistically model ecosystems and to predict the effects of environmental\ndisturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics. Ideally, these models are accurate enough to determine which\ncomponents of the ecosystem are particularly sensitive to disturbances, and they can serve as a guide to ecosystem managers\n(such as conservation ecologists or fisheries biologists) in the practical maintenance of ecosystem health.\nConceptual Models\nConceptual models are useful for describing ecosystem structure and dynamics and for demonstrating the relationships\nbetween different organisms in a community and their environment. Conceptual models are usually depicted graphically as\nflow charts. The organisms and their resources are grouped into specific compartments with arrows showing the relationship\nand transfer of energy or nutrients between them. Thus, these diagrams are sometimes called compartment models.\nTo model the cycling of mineral nutrients, organic and inorganic nutrients are subdivided into those that are bioavailable\n(ready to be incorporated into biological macromolecules) and those that are not. For example, in a terrestrial ecosystem\nnear a deposit of coal, carbon will be available to the plants of this ecosystem as carbon dioxide gas in a short-term\nperiod, not from the carbon-rich coal itself. However, over a longer period, microorganisms capable of digesting coal will\nincorporate its carbon or release it as natural gas (methane, CH4), changing this unavailable organic source into an available\none. This conversion is greatly accelerated by the combustion of fossil fuels by humans, which releases large amounts of\ncarbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This is thought to be a major factor in the rise of the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels\nin the industrial age. The carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels is produced faster than photosynthetic organisms\ncan use it. This process is intensified by the reduction of photosynthetic trees because of worldwide deforestation. Most\nscientists agree that high atmospheric carbon dioxide is a major cause of global climate change.\nConceptual models are also used to show the flow of energy through particular ecosystems. Figure 37.8 is based on Howard\n1. Nature (Vol. 458, April 1, 2009)\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\n1691\nT. Odum\u2019s classical study of the Silver Springs, Florida, holistic ecosystem in the mid-twentieth century.\n[2] This study shows\nthe energy content and transfer between various ecosystem compartments.\n2.

Notice that the energy decreases with each increase in trophic level.\nWhy do you think the value for gross productivity of the primary producers is the same as the value for total heat and\nrespiration ( 20, 810 kcal/ m2 / yr )?\na.\nTotal heat and respiration refers to the energy used by all trophic levels and the energy provided by the\nprimary producers is more than the energy provided by primary consumers to these levels.\nb.\nGross productivity of primary producers is the same as the value for total heat and respiration because of the\nhigh efficiency of conversion of solar energy to energy used by all trophic levels by primary producers.\nc.\nThe value for gross productivity of primary producers and total heat and respiration is same as primary\nproducers provide energy to primary consumers and secondary consumers only.\nd.\nTotal heat and respiration refers to energy used by all trophic levels and the only accessible energy to these\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\n1693\nlevels is provided by primary producers.\nAnalytical and Simulation Models\nThe major limitation of conceptual models is their inability to predict the consequences of changes in ecosystem species\nand/or environment. Ecosystems are dynamic entities and subject to a variety of abiotic and biotic disturbances caused by\nnatural forces and/or human activity. Ecosystems altered from their initial equilibrium state can often recover from such\ndisturbances and return to a state of equilibrium. As most ecosystems are subject to periodic disturbances and are often\nin a state of change, they are usually either moving toward or away from their equilibrium state. There are many of these\nequilibrium states among the various components of an ecosystem, which affects the ecosystem overall. Furthermore, as\nhumans have the ability to greatly and rapidly alter the species content and habitat of an ecosystem, the need for predictive\nmodels that enable understanding of how ecosystems respond to these changes becomes more crucial.\nAnalytical models often use simple, linear components of ecosystems, such as food chains, and are known to be complex\nmathematically; therefore, they require a significant amount of mathematical knowledge and expertise. Although analytical\nmodels have great potential, their simplification of complex ecosystems is thought to limit their accuracy. Simulation\nmodels that use computer programs are better able to deal with the complexities of ecosystem structure.\nA recent development in simulation modeling uses supercomputers to create and run individual-based simulations, which\naccounts for the behavior of individual organisms and their effects on the ecosystem as a whole. These simulations are\nconsidered to be the most accurate and predictive of the complex responses of ecosystems to disturbances.\nVisit The Darwin Project (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/Darwin_project) to view a variety of ecosystem models.\nWhy doesn\u2019t an increased number of prey species in marine ecosystems lead to maximal feeding of predators?\na.\nBecause there may not be enough predators that can eat each of the prey species.\nb.\nNon-maximal feeding of predators occurs due to inadequate dispersal of prey species in the marine\necosystems.\nc.\nNon maximal feeding of predators may occur due to the presence of new prey species with effective defenses\nthat are inherited.\nd.\nBecause of natural selection, non-maximal feeding of predators occurs.\n1694\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nActivity\nInvestigate a food web in an aquatic or terrestrial ecosystem of your choice, for example, coral reef.

        "summary": "Ecology for Ecosystems explores the structure, types, and dynamics of ecosystems, which are communities of living organisms interacting with their physical environments. Ecosystems are classified broadly as freshwater, marine, or terrestrial, each containing diverse subtypes. They experience natural and human-induced disturbances, with their stability measured by resistance (ability to remain in equilibrium) and resilience (speed of recovery). Food chains represent linear energy flow through trophic levels, while food webs provide a more accurate, interconnected model that includes grazing and detrital systems. Examples, such as the three-spined stickleback study, show how species evolution can influence environmental conditions. Ecosystem research uses holistic studies, controlled mesocosm or microcosm experiments, and three modeling approaches\u2014conceptual, analytical, and simulation\u2014to understand and predict ecosystem responses to changes, with simulation models offering the most complexity and predictive power. These tools help ecologists and conservationists analyze matter and energy flow, species interactions, and the impacts of disturbances on ecosystem health and sustainability."

Energy is required by most complex metabolic pathways (often\nin the form of adenosine triphosphate, ATP), especially those responsible for building large molecules from smaller\ncompounds, and life itself is an energy-driven process. Living organisms would not be able to assemble macromolecules\n(proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and complex carbohydrates) from their monomeric subunits without a constant energy input.\nIt is important to understand how organisms acquire energy and how that energy is passed from one organism to\nanother through food webs and their constituent food chains. Food webs illustrate how energy flows directionally through\necosystems, including how efficiently organisms acquire it, use it, and how much remains for use by other organisms of the\nfood web.\nHow Organisms Acquire Energy in a Food Web\nEnergy is acquired by living things in three ways: photosynthesis, chemosynthesis, and the consumption and digestion of\nother living or previously living organisms by heterotrophs.\nPhotosynthetic and chemosynthetic organisms are both grouped into a category known as autotrophs: organisms capable\nof synthesizing their own food (more specifically, capable of using inorganic carbon as a carbon source). Photosynthetic\nautotrophs (photoautotrophs) use sunlight as an energy source, whereas chemosynthetic autotrophs (chemoautotrophs) use\ninorganic molecules as an energy source. Autotrophs are critical for all ecosystems. Without these organisms, energy would\nnot be available to other living organisms and life itself would not be possible.\nPhotoautotrophs, such as plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria, serve as the energy source for a majority of the world\u2019s\necosystems. These ecosystems are often described by grazing food webs. Photoautotrophs harness the solar energy of the\nsun by converting it to chemical energy in the form of ATP (and NADP). The energy stored in ATP is used to synthesize\ncomplex organic molecules, such as glucose.\nChemoautotrophs are primarily bacteria that are found in rare ecosystems where sunlight is not available, such as in\nthose associated with dark caves or hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean (Figure 37.9). Many chemoautotrophs\nin hydrothermal vents use hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is released from the vents as a source of chemical energy. This\nallows chemoautotrophs to synthesize complex organic molecules, such as glucose, for their own energy and in turn supplies\nenergy to the rest of the ecosystem.\n1696\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 37.9 Swimming shrimp, a few squat lobsters, and hundreds of vent mussels are seen at a hydrothermal vent\nat the bottom of the ocean. As no sunlight penetrates to this depth, the ecosystem is supported by chemoautotrophic\nbacteria and organic material that sinks from the ocean\u2019s surface. This picture was taken in 2006 at the submerged NW\nEifuku volcano off the coast of Japan by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The summit of\nthis highly active volcano lies 1535 m below the surface.\nProductivity within Trophic Levels\nProductivity within an ecosystem can be defined as the percentage of energy entering the ecosystem incorporated into\nbiomass in a particular trophic level. Biomass is the total mass, in a unit area at the time of measurement, of living or\npreviously living organisms within a trophic level. Ecosystems have characteristic amounts of biomass at each trophic level.\nFor example, in the English Channel ecosystem the primary producers account for a biomass of 4 g/m2 (grams per meter\nsquared), while the primary consumers exhibit a biomass of 21 g/m2.\nThe productivity of the primary producers is especially important in any ecosystem because these organisms bring energy\nto other living organisms by photoautotrophy or chemoautotrophy. The rate at which photosynthetic primary producers\nincorporate energy from the sun is called gross primary productivity. An example of gross primary productivity is shown\nin the compartment diagram of energy flow within the Silver Springs aquatic ecosystem as shown (Figure 37.8). In this\necosystem, the total energy accumulated by the primary producers (gross primary productivity) was shown to be 20,810\nkcal/m2/yr.\nBecause all organisms need to use some of this energy for their own functions (like respiration and resulting metabolic heat\nloss) scientists often refer to the net primary productivity of an ecosystem. Net primary productivity is the energy that\nremains in the primary producers after accounting for the organisms\u2019 respiration and heat loss. The net productivity is then\navailable to the primary consumers at the next trophic level. In our Silver Spring example, 13,187 of the 20,810 kcal/m2/yr\nwere used for respiration or were lost as heat, leaving 7,632 kcal/m2/yr of energy for use by the primary consumers.\nEcological Efficiency: The Transfer of Energy between Trophic Levels\nAs illustrated in Figure 37.8, large amounts of energy are lost from the ecosystem from one trophic level to the next level\nas energy flows from the primary producers through the various trophic levels of consumers and decomposers. The main\nreason for this loss is the second law of thermodynamics, which states that whenever energy is converted from one form to\nanother, there is a tendency toward disorder (entropy) in the system. In biologic systems, this means a great deal of energy\nis lost as metabolic heat when the organisms from one trophic level consume the next level. In the Silver Springs ecosystem\nexample (Figure 37.8), we see that the primary consumers produced 1103 kcal/m2/yr from the 7618 kcal/m2/yr of energy\navailable to them from the primary producers. The measurement of energy transfer efficiency between two successive\ntrophic levels is termed the trophic level transfer efficiency (TLTE) and is defined by the formula:\nTLTE =  production at present trophic level\nproduction at previous trophic level \u00d7 100\nIn Silver Springs, the TLTE between the first two trophic levels was approximately 14.8 percent. The low efficiency of\nenergy transfer between trophic levels is usually the major factor that limits the length of food chains observed in a food\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\n1697\nweb. The fact is, after four to six energy transfers, there is not enough energy left to support another trophic level. In\nthe Lake Ontario example shown in Ecology of Ecosystems, only three energy transfers occurred between the primary\nproducer, (green algae), and the apex consumer (Chinook salmon).\nEcologists have many different methods of measuring energy transfers within ecosystems. Some transfers are easier or more\ndifficult to measure depending on the complexity of the ecosystem and how much access scientists have to observe the\necosystem. In other words, some ecosystems are more difficult to study than others, and sometimes the quantification of\nenergy transfers has to be estimated.\nAnother main parameter that is important in characterizing energy flow within an ecosystem is the net production efficiency.\nNet production efficiency (NPE) allows ecologists to quantify how efficiently organisms of a particular trophic level\nincorporate the energy they receive into biomass; it is calculated using the following formula:\nNPE =  net consumer productivity\nassimilation\n \u00d7 100\nNet consumer productivity is the energy content available to the organisms of the next trophic level. Assimilation is the\nbiomass (energy content generated per unit area) of the present trophic level after accounting for the energy lost due to\nincomplete ingestion of food, energy used for respiration, and energy lost as waste. Incomplete ingestion refers to the fact\nthat some consumers eat only a part of their food. For example, when a lion kills an antelope, it will eat everything except\nthe hide and bones. The lion is missing the energy-rich bone marrow inside the bone, so the lion does not make use of all\nthe calories its prey could provide.\nThus, NPE measures how efficiently each trophic level uses and incorporates the energy from its food into biomass to fuel\nthe next trophic level. In general, cold-blooded animals (ectotherms), such as invertebrates, fish, amphibians, and reptiles,\nuse less of the energy they obtain for respiration and heat than warm-blooded animals (endotherms), such as birds and\nmammals. The extra heat generated in endotherms, although an advantage in terms of the activity of these organisms in\ncolder environments, is a major disadvantage in terms of NPE. Therefore, many endotherms have to eat more often than\nectotherms to get the energy they need for survival. In general, NPE for ectotherms is an order of magnitude (10x) higher\nthan for endotherms. For example, the NPE for a caterpillar eating leaves has been measured at 18 percent, whereas the\nNPE for a squirrel eating acorns may be as low as 1.6 percent.\nThe inefficiency of energy use by warm-blooded animals has broad implications for the world's food supply. It is widely\naccepted that the meat industry uses large amounts of crops to feed livestock, and because the NPE is low, much of the\nenergy from animal feed is lost. For example, it costs about $0.01 to produce 1000 dietary calories (kcal) of corn or\nsoybeans, but approximately $0.19 to produce a similar number of calories growing cattle for beef consumption. The same\nenergy content of milk from cattle is also costly, at approximately $0.16 per 1000 kcal. Much of this difference is due to\nthe low NPE of cattle. Thus, there has been a growing movement worldwide to promote the consumption of non-meat and\nnon-dairy foods so that less energy is wasted feeding animals for the meat industry.\nModeling Ecosystems Energy Flow: Ecological Pyramids\nThe structure of ecosystems can be visualized with ecological pyramids, which were first described by the pioneering\nstudies of Charles Elton in the 1920s. Ecological pyramids show the relative amounts of various parameters (such as\nnumber of organisms, energy, and biomass) across trophic levels.\nPyramids of numbers can be either upright or inverted, depending on the ecosystem. As shown in Figure 37.10, typical\ngrassland during the summer has a base of many plants and the numbers of organisms decrease at each trophic level.\nHowever, during the summer in a temperate forest, the base of the pyramid consists of few trees compared with the number\nof primary consumers, mostly insects. Because trees are large, they have great photosynthetic capability, and dominate\nother plants in this ecosystem to obtain sunlight. Even in smaller numbers, primary producers in forests are still capable of\nsupporting other trophic levels.\nAnother way to visualize ecosystem structure is with pyramids of biomass. This pyramid measures the amount of energy\nconverted into living tissue at the different trophic levels. Using the Silver Springs ecosystem example, this data exhibits an\nupright biomass pyramid (Figure 37.10), whereas the pyramid from the English Channel example is inverted. The plants\n(primary producers) of the Silver Springs ecosystem make up a large percentage of the biomass found there. However, the\nphytoplankton in the English Channel example make up less biomass than the primary consumers, the zooplankton. As\nwith inverted pyramids of numbers, this inverted pyramid is not due to a lack of productivity from the primary producers,\nbut results from the high turnover rate of the phytoplankton. The phytoplankton are consumed rapidly by the primary\nconsumers, thus, minimizing their biomass at any particular point in time. However, phytoplankton reproduce quickly, thus\nthey are able to support the rest of the ecosystem.\nPyramid ecosystem modeling can also be used to show energy flow through the trophic levels. Notice that these numbers\n1698\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nare the same as those used in the energy flow compartment diagram in Figure 37.8. Pyramids of energy are always upright,\nand an ecosystem without sufficient primary productivity cannot be supported. All types of ecological pyramids are useful\nfor characterizing ecosystem structure. However, in the study of energy flow through the ecosystem, pyramids of energy are\nthe most consistent and representative models of ecosystem structure (Figure 37.10).\nFigure 37.10 Ecological pyramids depict the (a) biomass, (b) number of organisms, and (c) energy in each trophic\nlevel.\nPyramids depicting the number of organisms or biomass may be inverted, upright, or even diamond-shaped. Which\ntype of pyramid is always upright and why?\na.\nPyramid of biomass, as biomass will always be found at the base and there is loss and not gain of biomass\nthrough the trophic levels.\nb.\nPyramid of number, as the numbers of producers is always more than the number of consumers in every\necosystem.\nc.\nPyramid of energy, as energy will always be found at the base and there is loss and not gain of energy through\nthe trophic levels.\nd.\nPyramid of predators, as predators are always fewer in an ecosystem than the producers for the ecosystem to\nwork efficiently.\nConsequences of Food Webs: Biological Magnification\nOne of the most important environmental consequences of ecosystem dynamics is biomagnification. Biomagnification is\nthe increasing concentration of persistent, toxic substances in organisms at each trophic level, from the primary producers\nto the apex consumers. Many substances have been shown to bioaccumulate, including classical studies with the pesticide\ndichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), which was published in the 1960s bestseller, Silent Spring, by Rachel Carson.\nDDT was a commonly used pesticide before its dangers became known. In some aquatic ecosystems, organisms from each\ntrophic level consumed many organisms of the lower level, which caused DDT to increase in birds (apex consumers) that\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\n1699\nate fish. Thus, the birds accumulated sufficient amounts of DDT to cause fragility in their eggshells. This effect increased\negg breakage during nesting and was shown to have adverse effects on these bird populations. The use of DDT was banned\nin the United States in the 1970s.\nOther substances that biomagnify are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which were used in coolant liquids in the United\nStates until their use was banned in 1979, and heavy metals, such as mercury, lead, and cadmium. These substances were\nbest studied in aquatic ecosystems, where fish species at different trophic levels accumulate toxic substances brought\nthrough the ecosystem by the primary producers. As illustrated in a study performed by the National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron (Figure 37.11), PCB concentrations increased\nfrom the ecosystem\u2019s primary producers (phytoplankton) through the different trophic levels of fish species. The apex\nconsumer (walleye) has more than four times the amount of PCBs compared to phytoplankton. Also, based on results from\nother studies, birds that eat these fish may have PCB levels at least one order of magnitude higher than those found in the\nlake fish.\nFigure 37.11 This chart shows the PCB concentrations found at the various trophic levels in the Saginaw Bay\necosystem of Lake Huron. Numbers on the x-axis reflect enrichment with heavy isotopes of nitrogen (15N), which is a\nmarker for increasing trophic level. Notice that the fish in the higher trophic levels accumulate more PCBs than those\nin lower trophic levels. (credit: Patricia Van Hoof, NOAA, GLERL)\nOther concerns have been raised by the accumulation of heavy metals, such as mercury and cadmium, in certain types\nof seafood. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends that pregnant women and young\nchildren should not consume any swordfish, shark, king mackerel, or tilefish because of their high mercury content. These\nindividuals are advised to eat fish low in mercury: salmon, tilapia, shrimp, pollock, and catfish. Biomagnification is a good\nexample of how ecosystem dynamics can affect our everyday lives, even influencing the food we eat.\n1700\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nMany people enjoy eating swordfish, but pregnant women and young children should avoid it due to its high\nmercury content resulting from biomagnification.\nFigure 37.12\nWhy does biomagnification render larger, predatory species such as swordfish more toxic to humans than smaller,\nplanktivorous species such as anchovies?\na.\nLarger animals consume many small organisms, which leads to accumulation of oxygen in their body over\ntime.\nb.\nLarger animals consume many small organisms, which leads to accumulation of mercury in their body over\ntime.\nc.\nLarger animals consume many small organisms, which leads to accumulation of hydrogen in their body over\ntime.\nd.\nLarger animals consume many small organisms, which leads to accumulation of polyglucose in their body\nover time.\nLab Investigation\nAP\u00ae Biology Investigation Labs: Inquiry-Based Approach, Investigation 10: Energy Dynamics.

The hydrosphere is the area of the Earth\nwhere water movement and storage occurs: as liquid water on the surface and beneath the surface or frozen (rivers, lakes,\noceans, groundwater, polar ice caps, and glaciers), and as water vapor in the atmosphere. Carbon is found in all organic\nmacromolecules and is an important constituent of fossil fuels. Nitrogen is a major component of our nucleic acids and\nproteins and is critical to human agriculture. Phosphorus, a major component of nucleic acid (along with nitrogen), is one\nof the main ingredients in artificial fertilizers used in agriculture and their associated environmental impacts on our surface\nwater. Sulfur, critical to the 3\u2013D folding of proteins (as in disulfide binding), is released into the atmosphere by the burning\nof fossil fuels, such as coal.\nThe cycling of these elements is interconnected. For example, the movement of water is critical for the leaching of nitrogen\nand phosphate into rivers, lakes, and oceans. Furthermore, the ocean itself is a major reservoir for carbon. Thus, mineral\nnutrients are cycled, either rapidly or slowly, through the entire biosphere, from one living organism to another, and between\nthe biotic and abiotic world.\nHead to this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/biogeochemical) to learn more about biogeochemical cycles.\nWhat is true of geochemical cycles?\na.\nThere is a variable amount of each element on Earth.\nb.\nA reservoir is where elements remain through time.\nc.\nOnly external energy sources drive movement of elements.\nd.\nGeochemical cycles are characterized by the movement of elements.\nThe Water (Hydrologic) Cycle\nWater is the basis of all living processes. The human body is more than 1/2 water and human cells are more than 70 percent\nwater. Thus, most land animals need a supply of fresh water to survive. However, when examining the stores of water on\nEarth, 97.5 percent of it is non-potable salt water (Figure 37.13). Of the remaining water, 99 percent is locked underground\nas water or as ice. Thus, less than 1 percent of fresh water is easily accessible from lakes and rivers. Many living things, such\nas plants, animals, and fungi, are dependent on the small amount of fresh surface water supply, a lack of which can have\nmassive effects on ecosystem dynamics. Humans, of course, have developed technologies to increase water availability,\nsuch as digging wells to harvest groundwater, storing rainwater, and using desalination to obtain drinkable water from the\nocean. Although this pursuit of drinkable water has been ongoing throughout human history, the supply of fresh water is\nstill a major issue in modern times.\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\n1703\nFigure 37.13 Only 2.5 percent of water on Earth is fresh water, and less than 1 percent of fresh water is easily\naccessible to living things.\nWater cycling is extremely important to ecosystem dynamics. Water has a major influence on climate and, thus, on the\nenvironments of ecosystems, some located on distant parts of the Earth. Most of the water on Earth is stored for long periods\nin the oceans, underground, and as ice. Figure 37.14 illustrates the average time that an individual water molecule may\nspend in the Earth\u2019s major water reservoirs. Residence time is a measure of the average time an individual water molecule\nstays in a particular reservoir. A large amount of the Earth\u2019s water is locked in place in these reservoirs as ice, beneath the\nground, and in the ocean, and, thus, is unavailable for short-term cycling (only surface water can evaporate).\nFigure 37.14 This graph shows the average residence time for water molecules in the Earth\u2019s water reservoirs.\nThere are various processes that occur during the cycling of water, shown in Figure 37.15. These processes include the\nfollowing:\n\u2022\nevaporation/sublimation\n\u2022\ncondensation/precipitation\n\u2022\nsubsurface water flow\n\u2022\nsurface runoff/snowmelt\n\u2022\nstreamflow\nThe water cycle is driven by the sun\u2019s energy as it warms the oceans and other surface waters. This leads to the evaporation\n(water to water vapor) of liquid surface water and the sublimation (ice to water vapor) of frozen water, which deposits large\namounts of water vapor into the atmosphere. Over time, this water vapor condenses into clouds as liquid or frozen droplets\nand is eventually followed by precipitation (rain or snow), which returns water to the Earth\u2019s surface. Rain eventually\n1704\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\npermeates into the ground, where it may evaporate again if it is near the surface, flow beneath the surface, or be stored for\nlong periods. More easily observed is surface runoff: the flow of fresh water either from rain or melting ice. Runoff can then\nmake its way through streams and lakes to the oceans or flow directly to the oceans themselves.\nHead to this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/freshwater) to learn more about the world\u2019s fresh water supply.\nWater characterizes the most common and the most rare ecosystems worldwide.

Evans\nand Howard Perlman, USGS)\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\n1705\nThe Carbon Cycle\nCarbon is the second most abundant element in living organisms. Carbon is present in all organic molecules, and its role\nin the structure of macromolecules is of primary importance to living organisms. Carbon compounds contain especially\nhigh energy, particularly those derived from fossilized organisms, mainly plants, which humans use as fuel. Since the\n1800s, the number of countries using massive amounts of fossil fuels has increased. Since the beginning of the Industrial\nRevolution, global demand for the Earth\u2019s limited fossil fuel supplies has risen; therefore, the amount of carbon dioxide\nin our atmosphere has increased. This increase in carbon dioxide has been associated with climate change and other\ndisturbances of the Earth\u2019s ecosystems and is a major environmental concern worldwide. Thus, the \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d is\nbased on how much carbon dioxide is produced and how much fossil fuel countries consume.\nThe carbon cycle is most easily studied as two interconnected sub-cycles: one dealing with rapid carbon exchange among\nliving organisms and the other dealing with the long-term cycling of carbon through geologic processes. The entire carbon\ncycle is shown in Figure 37.16.\nFigure 37.16 Carbon dioxide gas exists in the atmosphere and is dissolved in water. Photosynthesis converts carbon\ndioxide gas to organic carbon, and respiration cycles the organic carbon back into carbon dioxide gas. Long-term\nstorage of organic carbon occurs when matter from living organisms is buried deep underground and becomes\nfossilized. Volcanic activity and, more recently, human emissions, bring this stored carbon back into the carbon cycle.\n(credit: modification of work by John M.

A good example of this connection is the\nexchange of carbon between autotrophs and heterotrophs within and between ecosystems by way of atmospheric carbon\ndioxide. Carbon dioxide is the basic building block that most autotrophs use to build multi-carbon, high energy compounds,\nsuch as glucose. The energy harnessed from the sun is used by these organisms to form the covalent bonds that link\ncarbon atoms together. These chemical bonds thereby store this energy for later use in the process of respiration. Most\nterrestrial autotrophs obtain their carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere, while marine autotrophs acquire it in the\ndissolved form (carbonic acid, H2CO3\u2212). However carbon dioxide is acquired, a by-product of the process is oxygen. The\nphotosynthetic organisms are responsible for depositing approximately 21 percent oxygen content of the atmosphere that\nwe observe today.\nHeterotrophs and autotrophs are partners in biological carbon exchange (especially the primary consumers, largely\nherbivores). Heterotrophs acquire the high-energy carbon compounds from the autotrophs by consuming them, and breaking\nthem down by respiration to obtain cellular energy, such as ATP. The most efficient type of respiration, aerobic respiration,\nrequires oxygen obtained from the atmosphere or dissolved in water. Thus, there is a constant exchange of oxygen and\ncarbon dioxide between the autotrophs (which need the carbon) and the heterotrophs (which need the oxygen). Gas\nexchange through the atmosphere and water is one way that the carbon cycle connects all living organisms on Earth.\nThe Biogeochemical Carbon Cycle\nThe movement of carbon through the land, water, and air is complex, and in many cases, it occurs much more slowly\ngeologically than as seen between living organisms. Carbon is stored for long periods in what are known as carbon\nreservoirs, which include the atmosphere, bodies of liquid water (mostly oceans), ocean sediment, soil, land sediments\n(including fossil fuels), and the Earth\u2019s interior.\nAs stated, the atmosphere is a major reservoir of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide and is essential to the process of\nphotosynthesis. The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is greatly influenced by the reservoir of carbon in the oceans.\nThe exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and water reservoirs influences how much carbon is found in each location,\nand each one affects the other reciprocally. Carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere dissolves in water and combines\nwith water molecules to form carbonic acid, and then it ionizes to carbonate and bicarbonate ions (Figure 37.17)\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\n1707\nFigure 37.17 Carbon dioxide reacts with water to form bicarbonate and carbonate ions.\nThe equilibrium coefficients are such that more than 90 percent of the carbon in the ocean is found as bicarbonate ions.\nSome of these ions combine with seawater calcium to form calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a major component of marine\norganism shells. These organisms eventually form sediments on the ocean floor. Over geologic time, the calcium carbonate\nforms limestone, which comprises the largest carbon reservoir on Earth.\nOn land, carbon is stored in soil as a result of the decomposition of living organisms (by decomposers) or from weathering\nof terrestrial rock and minerals. This carbon can be leached into the water reservoirs by surface runoff. Deeper underground,\non land and at sea, are fossil fuels: the anaerobically decomposed remains of plants that take millions of years to form.\nFossil fuels are considered a non-renewable resource because their use far exceeds their rate of formation. A non-renewable\nresource, such as fossil fuel, is either regenerated very slowly or not at all. Another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere\nis from land (including land beneath the surface of the ocean) by the eruption of volcanoes and other geothermal systems.\nCarbon sediments from the ocean floor are taken deep within the Earth by the process of subduction: the movement of one\ntectonic plate beneath another. Carbon is released as carbon dioxide when a volcano erupts or from volcanic hydrothermal\nvents.\nCarbon dioxide is also added to the atmosphere by the animal husbandry practices of humans. The large numbers of land\nanimals raised to feed the Earth\u2019s growing population results in increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere due to\nfarming practices and the respiration and methane production. This is another example of how human activity indirectly\naffects biogeochemical cycles in a significant way. Although much of the debate about the future effects of increasing\natmospheric carbon on climate change focuses on fossils fuels, scientists take natural processes, such as volcanoes and\nrespiration, into account as they model and predict the future impact of this increase.\nThe Nitrogen Cycle\nGetting nitrogen into the living world is difficult. Plants and phytoplankton are not equipped to incorporate nitrogen from\nthe atmosphere (which exists as tightly bonded, triple covalent N2) even though this molecule comprises approximately\n78 percent of the atmosphere. Nitrogen enters the living world via free-living and symbiotic bacteria, which incorporate\nnitrogen into their macromolecules through nitrogen fixation (conversion of N2). Cyanobacteria live in most aquatic\necosystems where sunlight is present; they play a key role in nitrogen fixation. Cyanobacteria are able to use inorganic\nsources of nitrogen to \u201cfix\u201d nitrogen. Rhizobium bacteria live symbiotically in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas,\nbeans, and peanuts) and provide them with the organic nitrogen they need. Free-living bacteria, such as Azotobacter, are\nalso important nitrogen fixers.\nOrganic nitrogen is especially important to the study of ecosystem dynamics since many ecosystem processes, such as\nprimary production and decomposition, are limited by the available supply of nitrogen. As shown in Figure 37.18, the\nnitrogen that enters living systems by nitrogen fixation is successively converted from organic nitrogen back into nitrogen\ngas by bacteria. This process occurs in three steps in terrestrial systems: ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification.\nFirst, the ammonification process converts nitrogenous waste from living animals or from the remains of dead animals\ninto ammonium (NH4+) by certain bacteria and fungi. Second, the ammonium is converted to nitrites (NO2\u2212) by nitrifying\nbacteria, such as Nitrosomonas, through nitrification. Subsequently, nitrites are converted to nitrates (NO3\u2212) by similar\norganisms. Third, the process of denitrification occurs, whereby bacteria, such as Pseudomonas and Clostridium, convert\nthe nitrates into nitrogen gas, allowing it to re-enter the atmosphere.\n1708\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 37.18 Nitrogen enters the living world from the atmosphere via nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This nitrogen and\nnitrogenous waste from animals is then processed back into gaseous nitrogen by soil bacteria, which also supply\nterrestrial food webs with the organic nitrogen they need. (credit: modification of work by John M. Evans and\nHoward Perlman, USGS)\nWhich of the following statements about the nitrogen cycle is false?\na.\nAmmonification converts organic nitrogenous matter from living organisms into ammonium (NH4+).\nb.\nDenitrification by bacteria converts nitrates (NO3-) to nitrogen gas (N2).\nc.\nNitrification by bacteria converts nitrates (NO3-) to nitrites (NO2-).\nd.\nNitrogen fixing bacteria convert nitrogen gas (N2) into organic compounds.\nHuman activity can release nitrogen into the environment by two primary means: the combustion of fossil fuels, which\nreleases different nitrogen oxides, and by the use of artificial fertilizers in agriculture, which are then washed into lakes,\nstreams, and rivers by surface runoff. Atmospheric nitrogen is associated with several effects on Earth\u2019s ecosystems\nincluding the production of acid rain (as nitric acid, HNO3) and greenhouse gas (as nitrous oxide, N2O) potentially causing\nclimate change. A major effect from fertilizer runoff is saltwater and freshwater eutrophication, a process whereby nutrient\nrunoff causes the excess growth of microorganisms, depleting dissolved oxygen levels and killing ecosystem fauna.\nA similar process occurs in the marine nitrogen cycle, where the ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification processes\nare performed by marine bacteria. Some of this nitrogen falls to the ocean floor as sediment, which can then be moved to\nland in geologic time by uplift of the Earth\u2019s surface and thereby incorporated into terrestrial rock. Although the movement\nof nitrogen from rock directly into living systems has been traditionally seen as insignificant compared with nitrogen fixed\nfrom the atmosphere, a recent study showed that this process may indeed be significant and should be included in any study\nof the global nitrogen cycle.\n[3]\n3.

Phosphorus is often the limiting nutrient (necessary\nfor growth) in aquatic ecosystems (Figure 37.19).\nPhosphorus occurs in nature as the phosphate ion (PO43\u2212). In addition to phosphate runoff as a result of human activity,\nnatural surface runoff occurs when it is leached from phosphate-containing rock by weathering, thus sending phosphates\ninto rivers, lakes, and the ocean. This rock has its origins in the ocean. Phosphate-containing ocean sediments form primarily\nfrom the bodies of ocean organisms and from their excretions. However, in remote regions, volcanic ash, aerosols, and\nmineral dust may also be significant phosphate sources. This sediment then is moved to land over geologic time by the\nuplifting of areas of the Earth\u2019s surface.\nPhosphorus is also reciprocally exchanged between phosphate dissolved in the ocean and marine ecosystems. The\nmovement of phosphate from the ocean to the land and through the soil is extremely slow, with the average phosphate ion\nhaving an oceanic residence time between 20,000 and 100,000 years.\nFigure 37.19 In nature, phosphorus exists as the phosphate ion (PO43\u2212). Weathering of rocks and volcanic activity\nreleases phosphate into the soil, water, and air, where it becomes available to terrestrial food webs. Phosphate enters\nthe oceans via surface runoff, groundwater flow, and river flow. Phosphate dissolved in ocean water cycles into marine\nfood webs. Some phosphate from the marine food webs falls to the ocean floor, where it forms sediment. (credit:\nmodification of work by John M. Evans and Howard Perlman, USGS)\nExcess phosphorus and nitrogen that enters these ecosystems from fertilizer runoff and from sewage causes excessive\ngrowth of microorganisms and depletes the dissolved oxygen, which leads to the death of many ecosystem fauna, such as\nshellfish and finfish. This process is responsible for dead zones in lakes and at the mouths of many major rivers (Figure\n37.19).\n1710\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 37.20 Dead zones occur when phosphorus and nitrogen from fertilizers cause excessive growth of\nmicroorganisms, which depletes oxygen and kills fauna. Worldwide, large dead zones are found in coastal areas of\nhigh population density. (credit: NASA Earth Observatory)\nA dead zone is an area within a freshwater or marine ecosystem where large areas are depleted of their normal flora and\nfauna; these zones can be caused by eutrophication, oil spills, dumping of toxic chemicals, and other human activities. The\nnumber of dead zones has been increasing for several years, and more than 400 of these zones were present as of 2008.\nOne of the worst dead zones is off the coast of the United States in the Gulf of Mexico, where fertilizer runoff from the\nMississippi River basin has created a dead zone of over 8463 square miles. Phosphate and nitrate runoff from fertilizers also\nnegatively affect several lake and bay ecosystems including the Chesapeake Bay in the eastern United States.\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\n1711\nChesapeake Bay\nFigure 37.21 This (a) satellite image shows the Chesapeake Bay, an ecosystem affected by phosphate and nitrate\nrunoff. A (b) member of the Army Corps of Engineers holds a clump of oysters being used as a part of the oyster\nrestoration effort in the bay. (credit a: modification of work by NASA/MODIS; credit b: modification of work by U.S.\nArmy)\nThe Chesapeake Bay has long been valued as one of the most scenic areas on Earth; it is now in distress\nand is recognized as a declining ecosystem. In the 1970s, the Chesapeake Bay was one of the first\necosystems to have identified dead zones, which continue to kill many fish and bottom-dwelling species,\nsuch as clams, oysters, and worms. Several species have declined in the Chesapeake Bay due to surface\nwater runoff containing excess nutrients from artificial fertilizer used on land. The source of the fertilizers\n(with high nitrogen and phosphate content) is not limited to agricultural practices. There are many nearby\nurban areas and more than 150 rivers and streams empty into the bay that are carrying fertilizer runoff\nfrom lawns and gardens. Thus, the decline of the Chesapeake Bay is a complex issue and requires the\ncooperation of industry, agriculture, and everyday homeowners.\nOf particular interest to conservationists is the oyster population; it is estimated that more than 200,000\nacres of oyster reefs existed in the bay in the 1700s, but that number has now declined to only 36,000\nacres. Oyster harvesting was once a major industry for Chesapeake Bay, but it declined 88 percent between\n1982 and 2007. This decline was due not only to fertilizer runoff and dead zones but also to overharvesting.\nOysters require a certain minimum population density because they must be in close proximity to reproduce.\nHuman activity has altered the oyster population and locations, greatly disrupting the ecosystem.\nThe restoration of the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay has been ongoing for several years with\nmixed success. Not only do many people find oysters good to eat, but they also clean up the bay. Oysters\nare filter feeders, and as they eat, they clean the water around them. In the 1700s, it was estimated that\nit took only a few days for the oyster population to filter the entire volume of the bay. Today, with changed\nwater conditions, it is estimated that the present population would take nearly a year to do the same job.\nRestoration efforts have been ongoing for several years by non-profit organizations, such as the\nChesapeake Bay Foundation. The restoration goal is to find a way to increase population density so the\noysters can reproduce more efficiently. Many disease-resistant varieties (developed at the Virginia Institute\nof Marine Science for the College of William and Mary) are now available and have been used in the\nconstruction of experimental oyster reefs. Efforts to clean and restore the bay by Virginia and Delaware have\nbeen hampered because much of the pollution entering the bay comes from other states, which stresses\nthe need for inter-state cooperation to gain successful restoration.\nThe new, hearty oyster strains have also spawned a new and economically viable industry\u2014oyster\n1712\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\naquaculture\u2014which not only supplies oysters for food and profit, but also has the added benefit of cleaning\nthe bay.\nHow did fertilizer runoff produce a dead zone in the Chesapeake Bay?\na.\nExcess nitrogen from fertilizer decreases microbial growth, depleting dissolved oxygen in water, thereby\nkilling the fauna of the ecosystem.\nb.\nFertilizer runoff decreases the carbon dioxide concentration in water, thereby killing fauna of the ecosystem.\nc.\nFertilizer runoff produces a dead zone in the Chesapeake Bay by increasing oxygen concentration in the\necosystem.\nd.\nExcess nitrogen from fertilizer increases microbial growth, depleting dissolved oxygen in water, thereby\nkilling the fauna of the ecosystem.\nThe Sulfur Cycle\nSulfur is an essential element for the macromolecules of living things. As a part of the amino acid cysteine, it is involved\nin the formation of disulfide bonds within proteins, which help to determine their 3-D folding patterns, and hence their\nfunctions. As shown in Figure 37.21, sulfur cycles between the oceans, land, and atmosphere. Atmospheric sulfur is found\nin the form of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and enters the atmosphere in three ways: from the decomposition of organic molecules,\nfrom volcanic activity and geothermal vents, and from the burning of fossil fuels by humans.\nFigure 37.22 Sulfur dioxide from the atmosphere becomes available to terrestrial and marine ecosystems when it is\ndissolved in precipitation as weak sulfuric acid or when it falls directly to the Earth as fallout. Weathering of rocks also\nmakes sulfates available to terrestrial ecosystems. Decomposition of living organisms returns sulfates to the ocean,\nsoil and atmosphere. (credit: modification of work by John M. Evans and Howard Perlman, USGS)\nOn land, sulfur is deposited in four major ways: precipitation, direct fallout from the atmosphere, rock weathering, and\ngeothermal vents (Figure 37.22). Atmospheric sulfur is found in the form of sulfur dioxide (SO2), and as rain falls through\nthe atmosphere, sulfur is dissolved in the form of weak sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Sulfur can also fall directly from the\natmosphere in a process called fallout. Also, the weathering of sulfur-containing rocks releases sulfur into the soil. These\nrocks originate from ocean sediments that are moved to land by the geologic uplifting of ocean sediments. Terrestrial\necosystems can then make use of these soil sulfates ( SO4\u2212), and upon the death and decomposition of these organisms,\nrelease the sulfur back into the atmosphere as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas.\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\n1713\nFigure 37.23 At this sulfur vent in Lassen Volcanic National Park in northeastern California, the yellowish sulfur\ndeposits are visible near the mouth of the vent.\nSulfur enters the ocean via runoff from land, from atmospheric fallout, and from underwater geothermal vents. Some\necosystems (Figure 37.9) rely on chemoautotrophs using sulfur as a biological energy source. This sulfur then supports\nmarine ecosystems in the form of sulfates.\nHuman activities have played a major role in altering the balance of the global sulfur cycle. The burning of large quantities\nof fossil fuels, especially from coal, releases larger amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas into the atmosphere. As rain falls\nthrough this gas, it creates the phenomenon known as acid rain. Acid rain is corrosive rain caused by rainwater falling to\nthe ground through sulfur dioxide gas, turning it into weak sulfuric acid, which causes damage to aquatic ecosystems. Acid\nrain damages the natural environment by lowering the pH of lakes, which kills many of the resident fauna; it also affects\nthe man-made environment through the chemical degradation of buildings. For example, many marble monuments, such as\nthe Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, have suffered significant damage from acid rain over the years. These examples\nshow the wide-ranging effects of human activities on our environment and the challenges that remain for our future.\nClick this link (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/climate_change) to learn more about global climate change.\nThe greenhouse effect is considered natural and essential to human survival. Why, then, is society concerned about the\nimpact of human activities on the greenhouse gas effect?\na.\nThe greenhouse effect is reduced due to human activities.\nb.\nHuman activities strengthen the greenhouse effect by trapping more heat in the atmosphere.\nc.\nHuman activities decrease the release of carbon dioxide gas, thereby strengthening the greenhouse effect.\nd.\nHuman activities cause less heat to be trapped in the atmosphere and decrease the temperature.\n1714\nChapter 37 | Ecosystems\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nacid rain\nanalytical model\napex consumer\nassimilation\nbiogeochemical cycle\nbiomagnification\nbiomass\nchemoautotroph\nconceptual model\ndead zone\ndetrital food web\necological pyramid\necosystem\necosystem dynamics\nequilibrium\neutrophication\nfallout\nfood chain\nfood web\ngrazing food web\ngross primary productivity\nholistic ecosystem model\nKEY TERMS\ncorrosive rain caused by rainwater falling to the ground through sulfur dioxide gas, turning it into weak sulfuric\nacid;

        "summary": "Biogeochemical cycles describe the movement and recycling of essential elements\u2014such as water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur\u2014through the biotic and abiotic components of Earth. These elements move between the atmosphere, bodies of water, soils, rocks, living organisms, and Earth\u2019s interior through biological, geological, and chemical processes, often interacting with each other. The water cycle, driven by solar energy, regulates climate and transports nutrients, though accessible freshwater is scarce. The carbon cycle involves rapid exchange between autotrophs and heterotrophs and long-term storage in reservoirs like fossil fuels, oceans, and limestone; human fossil fuel use has increased atmospheric CO\u2082, contributing to climate change. The nitrogen cycle depends on bacteria for nitrogen fixation and transformation between chemical forms, and is heavily impacted by fertilizer use and fossil fuel combustion, which can cause eutrophication and acid rain. The phosphorus cycle, lacking an atmospheric component, moves slowly from rocks to organisms, but human-caused nutrient runoff has led to aquatic dead zones, exemplified by the Chesapeake Bay. The sulfur cycle moves sulfur through geological activity, decomposition, and the atmosphere, with human fossil fuel burning intensifying acid rain and ecosystem damage. Human activities significantly alter all these cycles, often causing environmental harm."

Located in the Great Rift Valley, Lake Victoria is a large lake about 68,900 km2 in area (larger than\nLake Huron, the second largest of North America\u2019s Great Lakes). Biologists were studying species of a family of fish\ncalled cichlids. They found that as they sampled for fish in different locations of the lake, they never stopped finding\nnew species, and they identified nearly 500 evolved types of cichlids. But while studying these variations, they quickly\ndiscovered that the invasive Nile Perch was destroying the lake\u2019s cichlid population, bringing hundreds of cichlid species\nto extinction with devastating rapidity. You can read more about the new species of cichlids at the Science Daily website\n(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32dreampond) .\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\n1727\n38.1 | The Biodiversity Crisis\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are the different types of biodiversity?\n\u2022\nWhy can biodiversity be described as the equilibrium of naturally fluctuating rates of extinction and speciation?\n\u2022\nWhat are examples of historical causes of high extinction rates in Earth\u2019s history?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nWe have come to the last chapter in the text, and the journey has taken us from the origin of life on Earth to the exploration\nof the myriad and diverse organisms that currently inhabit our planet. Although some information in this chapter is not in\nscope for AP\u00ae, we must recognize how the activities of our own species, Home sapiens, impact ecosystems and the species\ninhabiting them. By appreciating and protecting other species, we preserve our own. The inverse is also true.\nThe exact number and kinds of species on Earth is unknown, but scientists estimate that there are about 8.7 million\neukaryotic species, with only 1.5 million identified, named, and studied. The number of prokaryotes far exceeds these\nnumbers. Biodiversity describes the number and variety of organisms in the biosphere.\nWe have learned that evolution and speciation continue to occur, but Earth has experienced five mass extinctions\u2014the\nelimination of major groups of species. For AP\u00ae you do not need to know the names, dates and causes of these extinctions;\nhowever understanding them will help you understand how biodiversity has changed over time.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 1 and Big Idea 4\nof the AP\u00ae Biology Curriculum Framework.

These estimation\nindexes, which came from information theory, are most useful as a first step in quantifying biodiversity between and within\necosystems; they are less useful when the main concern among conservation biologists is simply the loss of biodiversity.\nHowever, biologists recognize that measures of biodiversity, in terms of species diversity, may help focus efforts to preserve\nthe biologically or technologically important elements of biodiversity.\nThe Lake Victoria cichlids provide an example through which we can begin to understand biodiversity. The biologists\nstudying cichlids in the 1980s discovered hundreds of cichlid species representing a variety of specializations to particular\nhabitat types and specific feeding strategies: eating plankton floating in the water, scraping and then eating algae from\nrocks, eating insect larvae from the bottom, and eating the eggs of other species of cichlid. The cichlids of Lake Victoria\nare the product of an adaptive radiation. An adaptive radiation is a rapid (less than three million years in the case of the\nLake Victoria cichlids) branching through speciation of a phylogenetic tree into many closely related species; typically, the\nspecies \u201cradiate\u201d into different habitats and niches. The Gal\u00e1pagos finches are an example of a modest adaptive radiation\nwith 15 species. The cichlids of Lake Victoria are an example of a spectacular adaptive radiation that includes about 500\nspecies.\nAt the time biologists were making this discovery, some species began to quickly disappear. A culprit in these declines was\na species of large fish that was introduced to Lake Victoria by fisheries to feed the people living around the lake. The Nile\nperch was introduced in 1963, but lay low until the 1980s when its populations began to surge. The Nile perch population\ngrew by consuming cichlids, driving species after species to the point of extinction (the disappearance of a species). In\nfact, there were several factors that played a role in the extinction of perhaps 200 cichlid species in Lake Victoria: the Nile\nperch, declining lake water quality due to agriculture and land clearing on the shores of Lake Victoria, and increased fishing\npressure. Scientists had not even catalogued all of the species present\u2014so many were lost that were never named. The\ndiversity is now a shadow of what it once was.\nThe cichlids of Lake Victoria are a thumbnail sketch of contemporary rapid species loss that occurs all over Earth and is\ncaused by human activity. Extinction is a natural process of macroevolution that occurs at the rate of about one out of 1\nmillion species becoming extinct per year. The fossil record reveals that there have been five periods of mass extinction\nin history with much higher rates of species loss, and the rate of species loss today is comparable to those periods of\nmass extinction. However, there is a major difference between the previous mass extinctions and the current extinction\nwe are experiencing: human activity. Specifically, three human activities have a major impact: destruction of habitat,\nintroduction of exotic species, and over-harvesting. Predictions of species loss within the next century, a tiny amount of\ntime on geological timescales, range from 10 percent to 50 percent. Extinctions on this scale have only happened five other\ntimes in the history of the planet, and they have been caused by cataclysmic events that changed the course of the history of\nlife in each instance. Earth is now in one of those times.\nTypes of Biodiversity\nScientists generally accept that the term biodiversity describes the number and kinds of species in a location or on the planet.\nSpecies can be difficult to define, but most biologists still feel comfortable with the concept and are able to identify and\ncount eukaryotic species in most contexts. Biologists have also identified alternate measures of biodiversity, some of which\nare important for planning how to preserve biodiversity.\nGenetic diversity is one of those alternate concepts. Genetic diversity or variation is the raw material for adaptation in a\nspecies. A species\u2019 future potential for adaptation depends on the genetic diversity held in the genomes of the individuals in\npopulations that make up the species. The same is true for higher taxonomic categories. A genus with very different types\nof species will have more genetic diversity than a genus with species that look alike and have similar ecologies. If there\nwere a choice between one of these genera of species being preserved, the one with the greatest potential for subsequent\nevolution is the most genetically diverse one. It would be ideal not to have to make such choices, but increasingly this may\nbe the norm.\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\n1729\nMany genes code for proteins, which in turn carry out the metabolic processes that keep organisms alive and reproducing.\nGenetic diversity can be measured as chemical diversity in that different species produce a variety of chemicals in their\ncells, both the proteins as well as the products and byproducts of metabolism. This chemical diversity has potential benefit\nfor humans as a source of pharmaceuticals, so it provides one way to measure diversity that is important to human health\nand welfare.\nHumans have generated diversity in domestic animals, plants, and fungi. This diversity is also suffering losses because of\nmigration, market forces, and increasing globalism in agriculture, especially in heavily populated regions such as China,\nIndia, and Japan. The human population directly depends on this diversity as a stable food source, and its decline is troubling\nbiologists and agricultural scientists.\nIt is also useful to define ecosystem diversity, meaning the number of different ecosystems on the planet or in a given\ngeographic area (Figure 38.2). Whole ecosystems can disappear even if some of the species might survive by adapting to\nother ecosystems. The loss of an ecosystem means the loss of interactions between species, the loss of unique features of\ncoadaptation, and the loss of biological productivity that an ecosystem is able to create. An example of a largely extinct\necosystem in North America is the prairie ecosystem. Prairies once spanned central North America from the boreal forest in\nnorthern Canada down into Mexico. They are now all but gone, replaced by crop fields, pasture lands, and suburban sprawl.\nMany of the species survive, but the hugely productive ecosystem that was responsible for creating the most productive\nagricultural soils is now gone. As a consequence, soils are disappearing or must be maintained at greater expense.\nFigure 38.2 The variety of ecosystems on Earth\u2014from (a) coral reef to (b) prairie\u2014enables a great diversity of species\nto exist.

A recent estimate suggests that\nthe eukaryote species for which science has names, about 1.5 million species, account for less than 20 percent of the\ntotal number of eukaryote species present on the planet (8.7 million species, by one estimate). Estimates of numbers of\n1730\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nprokaryotic species are largely guesses, but biologists agree that science has only begun to catalog their diversity. Even with\nwhat is known, there is no central repository of names or samples of the described species; therefore, there is no way to be\nsure that the 1.5 million descriptions is an accurate number. It is a best guess based on the opinions of experts in different\ntaxonomic groups. Given that Earth is losing species at an accelerating pace, science is very much in the place it was with\nthe Lake Victoria cichlids: knowing little about what is being lost. Table 38.1 presents recent estimates of biodiversity in\ndifferent groups.\nEstimates of the Numbers of Described and Predicted Species by Taxonomic\nGroup\nMora et al. 2011\n[1]\nChapman 2009\n[2]\nGroombridge & Jenkins\n2002\n[3]\nDescribed\nPredicted\nDescribed\nPredicted\nDescribed\nPredicted\nAnimalia\n1,124,516\n9,920,000\n1,424,153\n6,836,330\n1,225,500\n10,820,000\nChromista\n17,892\n34,900\n25,044\n200,500\n\u2014\n\u2014\nFungi\n44,368\n616,320\n98,998\n1,500,000\n72,000\n1,500,000\nPlantae\n224,244\n314,600\n310,129\n390,800\n270,000\n320,000\nProtozoa\n16,236\n72,800\n28,871\n1,000,000\n80,000\n600,000\nProkaryotes\n\u2014\n\u2014\n10,307\n1,000,000\n10,175\n\u2014\nTotal\n1,438,769\n10,960,000\n1,897,502\n10,897,630\n1,657,675\n13,240,000\nTable 38.1\nThere are various initiatives to catalog described species in accessible ways, and the internet is facilitating that effort.\nNevertheless, it has been pointed out that at the current rate of species description, which according to the State of Observed\nSpecies Report is 17,000 to 20,000 new species per year, it will take close to 500 years to finish describing life on this\nplanet.\n[4] Over time, the task becomes both increasingly impossible and increasingly easier as extinction removes species\nfrom the planet.\nNaming and counting species may seem an unimportant pursuit given the other needs of humanity, but it is not simply an\naccounting. Describing species is a complex process by which biologists determine an organism\u2019s unique characteristics and\nwhether or not that organism belongs to any other described species. It allows biologists to find and recognize the species\nafter the initial discovery, and allows them to follow up on questions about its biology. In addition, the unique characteristics\nof each species make it potentially valuable to humans or other species on which humans depend. Understanding these\ncharacteristics is the value of finding and naming species.\nPatterns of Biodiversity\nBiodiversity is not evenly distributed on Earth. Lake Victoria contained almost 500 species of cichlids alone, ignoring the\nother fish families present in the lake. All of these species were found only in Lake Victoria; therefore, the 500 species\nof cichlids were endemic. Endemic species are found in only one location. Endemics with highly restricted distributions\nare particularly vulnerable to extinction. Higher taxonomic levels, such as genera and families, can also be endemic. Lake\nHuron contains about 79 species of fish, all of which are found in many other lakes in North America. What accounts for the\ndifference in fish diversity in these two lakes? Lake Victoria is a tropical lake, while Lake Huron is a temperate lake. Lake\nHuron in its present form is only about 7,000 years old, while Lake Victoria in its present form is about 15,000 years old.\nBiogeographers have suggested these two factors, latitude and age, are two of several hypotheses to explain biodiversity\npatterns on the planet.\n1.

The\nwork of biogeographers is critical to understanding our physical environment, how the environment affects\nspecies, and how environmental changes impact the distribution of a species; it has also been critical to\ndeveloping evolutionary theory. Biogeographers need to understand both biology and ecology. They also\nneed to be well-versed in evolutionary studies, soil science, and climatology.\nThere are three main fields of study under the heading of biogeography: ecological biogeography, historical\nbiogeography (called paleobiogeography), and conservation biogeography. Ecological biogeography\nstudies the current factors affecting the distribution of plants and animals. Historical biogeography, as the\nname implies, studies the past distribution of species. Conservation biogeography, on the other hand, is\nfocused on the protection and restoration of species based upon known historical and current ecological\ninformation. Each of these fields considers both zoogeography and phytogeography\u2014the past and present\ndistribution of animals and plants.\nOne of the oldest observed patterns in ecology is that species biodiversity in almost every taxonomic group increases as\nlatitude declines. In other words, biodiversity increases closer to the equator (Figure 38.3).\nFigure 38.3 This map illustrates the number of amphibian species across the globe and shows the trend toward higher\nbiodiversity at lower latitudes. A similar pattern is observed for most taxonomic groups.\nIt is not yet clear why biodiversity increases closer to the equator, but hypotheses include the greater age of the ecosystems\nin the tropics versus temperate regions that were largely devoid of life or drastically impoverished during the last glaciation.\nThe idea is that greater age provides more time for speciation. Another possible explanation is the increased energy the\ntropics receive from the sun versus the decreased energy that temperate and polar regions receive. It is not entirely clear\nhow greater energy input could translate into more species. The complexity of tropical ecosystems may promote speciation\nby increasing the heterogeneity, or number of ecological niches, in the tropics relative to higher latitudes. The greater\nheterogeneity provides more opportunities for coevolution, specialization, and perhaps greater selection pressures leading\nto population differentiation. However, this hypothesis suffers from some circularity\u2014ecosystems with more species\nencourage speciation, but how did they get more species to begin with? The tropics have been perceived as being more\nstable than temperate regions, which have a pronounced climate and day-length seasonality. The tropics have their own\nforms of seasonality, such as rainfall, but they are generally assumed to be more stable environments and this stability might\npromote speciation.\nRegardless of the mechanisms, it is certainly true that all levels of biodiversity are greatest in the tropics. Additionally, the\n1732\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nrate of endemism is highest, and there are more biodiversity hotspots. However, this richness of diversity also means that\nknowledge of species is lowest, and there is a high potential for biodiversity loss.\nConservation of Biodiversity\nIn 1988, British environmentalist Norman Myers developed a conservation concept to identify areas rich in species and\nat significant risk for species loss: biodiversity hotspots. Biodiversity hotspots are geographical areas that contain high\nnumbers of endemic species. The purpose of the concept was to identify important locations on the planet for conservation\nefforts, a kind of conservation triage. By protecting hotspots, governments are able to protect a larger number of species.\nThe original criteria for a hotspot included the presence of 1500 or more endemic plant species and 70 percent of the area\ndisturbed by human activity. There are now 34 biodiversity hotspots (Figure 38.4) containing large numbers of endemic\nspecies, which include half of Earth\u2019s endemic plants.\nFigure 38.4 Conservation International has identified 34 biodiversity hotspots, which cover only 2.3 percent of the\nEarth\u2019s surface but have endemic to them 42 percent of the terrestrial vertebrate species and 50 percent of the world\u2019s\nplants.\nBiodiversity Change through Geological Time\nThe number of species on the planet, or in any geographical area, is the result of an equilibrium of two evolutionary\nprocesses that are ongoing: speciation and extinction. Both are natural \u201cbirth\u201d and \u201cdeath\u201d processes of macroevolution.\nWhen speciation rates begin to outstrip extinction rates, the number of species will increase; likewise, the number of species\nwill decrease when extinction rates begin to overtake speciation rates. Throughout Earth\u2019s history, these two processes\nhave fluctuated\u2014sometimes leading to dramatic changes in the number of species on Earth as reflected in the fossil record\n(Figure 38.5).\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\n1733\nFigure 38.5 Percent extinction occurrences as reflected in the fossil record have fluctuated throughout Earth\u2019s history.\nSudden and dramatic losses of biodiversity, called mass extinctions, have occurred five times.\nPaleontologists have identified five strata in the fossil record that appear to show sudden and dramatic (greater than half\nof all extant species disappearing from the fossil record) losses in biodiversity. These are called mass extinctions. There\nare many lesser, yet still dramatic, extinction events, but the five mass extinctions have attracted the most research. An\nargument can be made that the five mass extinctions are only the five most extreme events in a continuous series of large\nextinction events throughout the Phanerozoic (since 542 million years ago). In most cases, the hypothesized causes are still\ncontroversial; however, the most recent event seems clear.\nThe Five Mass Extinctions\nThe fossil record of the mass extinctions was the basis for defining periods of geological history, so they typically occur\nat the transition point between geological periods. The transition in fossils from one period to another reflects the dramatic\nloss of species and the gradual origin of new species. These transitions can be seen in the rock strata. Table 38.2 provides\ndata on the five mass extinctions.\nMass Extinctions\nGeological Period\nMass Extinction Name\nTime (millions of years ago)\nOrdovician\u2013Silurian\nend-Ordovician O\u2013S\n450\u2013440\nLate Devonian\nend-Devonian\n375\u2013360\nPermian\u2013Triassic\nend-Permian\n251\nTriassic\u2013Jurassic\nend-Triassic\n205\nCretaceous\u2013Paleogene end-Cretaceous K\u2013Pg (K\u2013T) 65.5\nTable 38.2 This table shows the names and dates for the five mass extinctions in\nEarth\u2019s history.\nThe Ordovician-Silurian extinction event is the first recorded mass extinction and the second largest. During this period,\nabout 85 percent of marine species (few species lived outside the oceans) became extinct. The main hypothesis for its cause\nis a period of glaciation and then warming. The extinction event actually consists of two extinction events separated by\nabout 1 million years. The first event was caused by cooling, and the second event was due to the subsequent warming. The\nclimate changes affected temperatures and sea levels. Some researchers have suggested that a gamma-ray burst, caused by a\nnearby supernova, is a possible cause of the Ordovician-Silurian extinction. The gamma-ray burst would have stripped away\n1734\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nthe Earth\u2019s ozone layer causing intense ultraviolet radiation from the sun and may account for climate changes observed\nat the time. The hypothesis is speculative, but extraterrestrial influences on Earth\u2019s history are an active line of research.\nRecovery of biodiversity after the mass extinction took from 5 to 20 million years, depending on the location.\nThe late Devonian extinction may have occurred over a relatively long period of time. It appears to have affected marine\nspecies and not the plants or animals inhabiting terrestrial habitats. The causes of this extinction are poorly understood.\nThe end-Permian extinction was the largest in the history of life. Indeed, an argument could be made that Earth nearly\nbecame devoid of life during this extinction event. The planet looked very different before and after this event. Estimates are\nthat 96 percent of all marine species and 70 percent of all terrestrial species were lost. It was at this time, for example, that\nthe trilobites, a group that survived the Ordovician\u2013Silurian extinction, became extinct. The causes for this mass extinction\nare not clear, but the leading suspect is extended and widespread volcanic activity that led to a runaway global-warming\nevent. The oceans became largely anoxic, suffocating marine life. Terrestrial tetrapod diversity took 30 million years to\nrecover after the end-Permian extinction. The Permian extinction dramatically altered Earth\u2019s biodiversity makeup and the\ncourse of evolution.\nThe causes of the Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event are not clear and hypotheses of climate change, asteroid impact, and\nvolcanic eruptions have been argued. The extinction event occurred just before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea,\nalthough recent scholarship suggests that the extinctions may have occurred more gradually throughout the Triassic.\nThe causes of the end-Cretaceous extinction event are the ones that are best understood. It was during this extinction event\nabout 65 million years ago that the dinosaurs, the dominant vertebrate group for millions of years, disappeared from the\nplanet (with the exception of a theropod clade that gave rise to birds). Indeed, every land animal that weighed more then\n25 kg became extinct. The cause of this extinction is now understood to be the result of a cataclysmic impact of a large\nmeteorite, or asteroid, off the coast of what is now the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. This hypothesis, proposed first in 1980, was\na radical explanation based on a sharp spike in the levels of iridium (which rains down from space in meteors at a fairly\nconstant rate but is otherwise absent on Earth\u2019s surface) at the rock stratum that marks the boundary between the Cretaceous\nand Paleogene periods (Figure 38.6). This boundary marked the disappearance of the dinosaurs in fossils as well as many\nother taxa. The researchers who discovered the iridium spike interpreted it as a rapid influx of iridium from space to the\natmosphere (in the form of a large asteroid) rather than a slowing in the deposition of sediments during that period. It was\na radical explanation, but the report of an appropriately aged and sized impact crater in 1991 made the hypothesis more\nbelievable. Now an abundance of geological evidence supports the theory. Recovery times for biodiversity after the end-\nCretaceous extinction are shorter, in geological time, than for the end-Permian extinction, on the order of 10 million years.\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\n1735\nFigure 38.6 In 1980, Luis and Walter Alvarez, Frank Asaro, and Helen Michels discovered, across the world,\na spike in the concentration of iridium within the sedimentary layer at the K\u2013Pg boundary. These researchers\nhypothesized that this iridium spike was caused by an asteroid impact that resulted in the K\u2013Pg mass extinction.\nIn the photo, the iridium layer is the light band.

It is well known that the North American,\nand to some degree Eurasian, megafauna, or large animals, disappeared toward the end of the last glaciation period. The\nextinction appears to have happened in a relatively restricted time period of 10,000\u201312,000 years ago. In North America, the\nlosses were quite dramatic and included the woolly mammoths (last dated about 4,000 years ago in an isolated population),\nmastodon, giant beavers, giant ground sloths, saber-toothed cats, and the North American camel, just to name a few. The\npossibility that the rapid extinction of these large animals was caused by over-hunting was first suggested in the 1900s.\nResearch into this hypothesis continues today. It seems likely that over-hunting caused many pre-written history extinctions\nin many regions of the world.\nIn general, the timing of the Pleistocene extinctions correlated with the arrival of humans and not with climate-change\nevents, which is the main competing hypothesis for these extinctions. The extinctions began in Australia about 40,000\nto 50,000 years ago, just after the arrival of humans in the area: a marsupial lion, a giant one-ton wombat, and several\ngiant kangaroo species disappeared. In North America, the extinctions of almost all of the large mammals occurred\n10,000\u201312,000 years ago. All that are left are the smaller mammals such as bears, elk, moose, and cougars. Finally, on many\nremote oceanic islands, the extinctions of many species occurred coincident with human arrivals. Not all of the islands had\nlarge animals, but when there were large animals, they were lost. Madagascar was colonized about 2,000 years ago and the\nlarge mammals that lived there became extinct. Eurasia and Africa do not show this pattern, but they also did not experience\na recent arrival of humans. Humans arrived in Eurasia hundreds of thousands of years ago after the origin of the species in\nAfrica. This topic remains an area of active research and hypothesizing. It seems clear that even if climate played a role, in\nmost cases human hunting precipitated the extinctions.\nPresent-Time Extinctions\nThe sixth, or Holocene, mass extinction appears to have begun earlier than previously believed and has mostly to do with the\nactivities of Homo sapiens. Since the beginning of the Holocene period, there are numerous recent extinctions of individual\nspecies that are recorded in human writings. Most of these are coincident with the expansion of the European colonies since\nthe 1500s.\nOne of the earlier and popularly known examples is the dodo bird. The dodo bird lived in the forests of Mauritius, an island\nin the Indian Ocean. The dodo bird became extinct around 1662. It was hunted for its meat by sailors and was easy prey\nbecause the dodo, which did not evolve with humans, would approach people without fear. Introduced pigs, rats, and dogs\nbrought to the island by European ships also killed dodo young and eggs.\nSteller's sea cow became extinct in 1768; it was related to the manatee and probably once lived along the northwest coast of\nNorth America. Steller's sea cow was first discovered by Europeans in 1741 and was hunted for meat and oil. The last sea\ncow was killed in 1768. That amounts to 27 years between the sea cow\u2019s first contact with Europeans and extinction of the\nspecies.\nIn 1914, the last living passenger pigeon died in a zoo in Cincinnati, Ohio. This species had once darkened the skies of\nNorth America during its migrations, but it was hunted and suffered from habitat loss through the clearing of forests for\nfarmland. In 1918, the last living Carolina parakeet died in captivity. This species was once common in the eastern United\nStates, but it suffered from habitat loss. The species was also hunted because it ate orchard fruit when its native foods were\ndestroyed to make way for farmland. The Japanese sea lion, which inhabited a broad area around Japan and the coast of\nKorea, became extinct in the 1950s due to fishermen. The Caribbean monk seal was distributed throughout the Caribbean\nSea but was driven to extinction via hunting by 1952.\nThese are only a few of the recorded extinctions in the past 500 years. The International Union for Conservation of Nature\n(IUCN) keeps a list of extinct and endangered species called the Red List. The list is not complete, but it describes 380\nextinct species of vertebrates after 1500 AD, 86 of which were driven extinct by overhunting or overfishing.\nEstimates of Present-Time Extinction Rates\nEstimates of extinction rates are hampered by the fact that most extinctions are probably happening without observation.\nThe extinction of a bird or mammal is likely to be noticed by humans, especially if it has been hunted or used in some\nother way. But there are many organisms that are of less interest to humans (not necessarily of less value) and many that are\nundescribed.\nThe background extinction rate is estimated to be about one per million species per year (E/MSY). For example, assuming\nthere are about ten million species in existence, the expectation is that ten species would become extinct each year (each\nyear represents ten million species per year).\nOne contemporary extinction rate estimate uses the extinctions in the written record since the year 1500. For birds alone this\nmethod yields an estimate of 26 E/MSY. However, this value may be underestimated for three reasons. First, many species\nwould not have been described until much later in the time period, so their loss would have gone unnoticed. Second, the\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\n1737\nnumber of recently extinct species is increasing because extinct species now are being described from skeletal remains. And\nthird, some species are probably already extinct even though conservationists are reluctant to name them as such. Taking\nthese factors into account raises the estimated extinction rate closer to 100 E/MSY. The predicted rate by the end of the\ncentury is 1500 E/MSY.\nA second approach to estimating present-time extinction rates is to correlate species loss with habitat loss by measuring\nforest-area loss and understanding species-area relationships. The species-area relationship is the rate at which new species\nare seen when the area surveyed is increased. Studies have shown that the number of species present increases as the size of\nthe island increases. This phenomenon has also been shown to hold true in other habitats as well. Turning this relationship\naround, if the habitat area is reduced, the number of species living there will also decline. Estimates of extinction rates based\non habitat loss and species-area relationships have suggested that with about 90 percent habitat loss an expected 50 percent\nof species would become extinct. Species-area estimates have led to species extinction rate calculations of about 1000 E/\nMSY and higher. In general, actual observations do not show this amount of loss and suggestions have been made that there\nis a delay in extinction. Recent work has also called into question the applicability of the species-area relationship when\nestimating the loss of species. This work argues that the species-area relationship leads to an overestimate of extinction\nrates. A better relationship to use may be the endemics-area relationship. Using this method would bring estimates down to\naround 500 E/MSY in the coming century. Note that this value is still 500 times the background rate.\nFigure 38.7 Studies have shown that the number of species present increases with the size of the habitat.

        "summary": "The biodiversity crisis refers to the rapid and accelerating loss of Earth\u2019s species, largely due to human activities such as habitat destruction, introduction of invasive species, and overharvesting. Although extinction is a natural process, current rates rival those of the five historical mass extinctions, but with humans as the driving force. Biodiversity encompasses species diversity, genetic diversity, and ecosystem diversity, all of which are declining worldwide. Many species, such as Lake Victoria\u2019s cichlids, have vanished before even being documented, and biodiversity is unevenly distributed\u2014richest in the tropics and in biodiversity hotspots, which are areas dense with endemic species but under severe threat. The fossil record shows repeated fluctuations in biodiversity through speciation and extinction, including major events like the Ordovician-Silurian, Permian, and Cretaceous extinctions. Past lesser events, like the Pleistocene megafauna loss, often coincided with human arrival and hunting. Since the Holocene, documented examples such as the dodo bird and passenger pigeon illustrate modern human-driven extinctions. Estimates of current extinction rates, calculated from historical records and habitat loss models, suggest rates hundreds to thousands of times above the natural background, with projections of significant future species loss if current trends continue."

However, accelerated extinction rates accompanied by the loss of tens of\nthousands of species and the collapse of ecosystems can affect human welfare. With respect to health, many medicines,\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\n1739\nincluding aspirin, codeine, digoxin, atropine, and vincristine, are derived from plants. In recent years, animal venoms and\ntoxins have excited researchers because of their pharmaceutical potential. Agricultural diversity is a requirement for food\nsecurity, and the loss of wild relatives to crops threatens our ability to create new varieties that can grow in areas with\npreviously impossible climates and soil conditions. Since 1990, global fish production has declined, and for approximately\none billion of us, aquatic resources provide the main source of animal protein. Furthermore, who can put a number or\nmonetary value on the psychological benefits of the natural landscapes we enjoy while vacationing and artists use for\ninspiration?\nInformation presented and examples highlighted in this section are not within the scope for AP\u00ae and do not align to the\nCurriculum Framework.\nAgriculture began after early hunter-gatherer societies first settled in one place and heavily modified their immediate\nenvironment. This cultural transition has made it difficult for humans to recognize their dependence on undomesticated\nliving things on the planet. Biologists recognize the human species is embedded in ecosystems and is dependent on them,\njust as every other species on the planet is dependent. Technology smoothes out the extremes of existence, but ultimately\nthe human species cannot exist without its ecosystem.\nHuman Health\nContemporary societies that live close to the land often have a broad knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants growing in\ntheir area. Most plants produce secondary plant compounds, which are toxins used to protect the plant from insects and\nother animals that eat them, but some of which also work as medication. For centuries in Europe, older knowledge about\nthe medical uses of plants was compiled in herbals\u2014books that identified plants and their uses. Humans are not the only\nspecies to use plants for medicinal reasons: the great apes, orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas have all been\nobserved self-medicating with plants.\nModern pharmaceutical science also recognizes the importance of these plant compounds. Examples of significant\nmedicines derived from plant compounds include aspirin, codeine, digoxin, atropine, and vincristine (Figure 38.8). Many\nmedicines were once derived from plant extracts but are now synthesized. It is estimated that, at one time, 25 percent of\nmodern drugs contained at least one plant extract. That number has probably decreased to about 10 percent as natural plant\ningredients are replaced by synthetic versions. Antibiotics, which are responsible for extraordinary improvements in health\nand lifespans in developed countries, are compounds largely derived from fungi and bacteria.\nFigure 38.8 Catharanthus roseus, the Madagascar periwinkle, has various medicinal properties. Among other uses, it\nis a source of vincristine, a drug used in the treatment of lymphomas. (credit: Forest and Kim Starr)\nIn recent years, animal venoms and poisons have excited intense research for their medicinal potential. By 2007, the\nFDA had approved five drugs based on animal toxins to treat diseases such as hypertension, chronic pain, and diabetes.\nAnother five drugs are undergoing clinical trials, and at least six drugs are being used in other countries. Other toxins under\ninvestigation come from mammals, snakes, lizards, various amphibians, fish, snails, octopuses, and scorpions.\nAside from representing billions of dollars in profits, these medicines improve people\u2019s lives. Pharmaceutical companies are\nactively looking for new compounds synthesized by living organisms that can function as medicine. It is estimated that 1/3\nof pharmaceutical research and development is spent on natural compounds and that about 35 percent of new drugs brought\nto market between 1981 and 2002 were from natural compounds. The opportunities for new medications will be reduced in\ndirect proportion to the disappearance of species.\n1740\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nAgricultural Diversity\nSince the beginning of human agriculture more than 10,000 years ago, human groups have been breeding and selecting\ncrop varieties. This crop diversity matched the cultural diversity of highly subdivided populations of humans. For example,\npotatoes were domesticated beginning around 7,000 years ago in the central Andes of Peru and Bolivia. The potatoes grown\nin that region belong to seven species and the number of varieties likely is in the thousands. Each variety has been bred\nto thrive at particular elevations and soil and climate conditions. The diversity is driven by the diverse demands of the\ntopography, the limited movement of people, and the demands created by crop rotation for different varieties that will do\nwell in different fields.\nPotatoes are only one example of human-generated diversity. Every plant, animal, and fungus that has been cultivated by\nhumans has been bred from original wild ancestor species into diverse varieties arising from the demands for food value,\nadaptation to growing conditions, and resistance to pests. The potato demonstrates a well-known example of the risks of low\ncrop diversity: the tragic Irish potato famine when the single variety grown in Ireland became susceptible to a potato blight,\nwiping out the crop. The loss of the crop led to famine, death, and mass emigration. Resistance to disease is a chief benefit\nto maintaining crop biodiversity, and lack of diversity in contemporary crop species carries similar risks. Seed companies,\nwhich are the source of most crop varieties in developed countries, must continually breed new varieties to keep up with\nevolving pest organisms. These same seed companies, however, have participated in the decline of the number of varieties\navailable as they focus on selling fewer varieties in more areas of the world.\nThe ability to create new crop varieties relies on the diversity of varieties available and the accessibility of wild forms related\nto the crop plant. These wild forms are often the source of new gene variants that can be bred with existing varieties to create\nvarieties with new attributes. Loss of wild species related to a crop will mean the loss of potential in crop improvement.\nMaintaining the genetic diversity of wild species related to domesticated species ensures our continued food supply.\nSince the 1920s, government agriculture departments have maintained seed banks of crop varieties as a way to maintain crop\ndiversity. This system has flaws because, over time, seed banks are lost through accidents, and there is no way to replace\nthem. In 2008, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault (Figure 38.9) began storing seeds from around the world as a backup system\nto the regional seed banks. If a regional seed bank stores varieties in Svalbard, losses can be replaced from Svalbard. The\nseed vault is located deep into the rock of an arctic island. Conditions within the vault are maintained at ideal temperature\nand humidity for seed survival, but the deep underground location of the vault in the arctic means that failure of the vault\u2019s\nsystems will not compromise the climatic conditions inside the vault.\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\n1741\nFigure 38.9 The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a storage facility for seeds of Earth\u2019s diverse crops. (credit: Mari\nTefre, Svalbard Global Seed Vault)\nThe Svalbard Global Seed Vault is located on Spitsbergen island in Norway, which has an arctic climate. Why might\nan arctic climate be good for seed storage?\na.\nSuch severe climatic conditions don\u2019t let seeds dry out; they retain water and remain viable.\nb.\nThe ground is permanently frozen, so the seeds will be kept at 10\u00b0C even if the electricity fails.\nc.\nBecause such a climate extends the dormancy periods of seeds to more than what is normal.\nd.\nBecause the ground is permanently frozen, the seeds will be kept below 0\u00b0C even if electricity fails.\nCrop success is largely dependent on the quality of the soil. Although some agricultural soils are rendered sterile using\ncontroversial cultivation and chemical treatments, most contain a huge diversity of organisms that maintain nutrient\ncycles\u2014breaking down organic matter into nutrient compounds that crops need for growth. These organisms also maintain\nsoil texture that affects water and oxygen dynamics in the soil that are necessary for plant growth. If farmers had to maintain\narable soil using alternate means, the cost of food would be much higher than it is now. These kinds of processes are called\necosystem services. They occur within ecosystems, such as soil ecosystems, as a result of the diverse metabolic activities of\nthe organisms living there, but they provide benefits to human food production, drinking water availability, and breathable\nair.\nOther key ecosystem services related to food production are plant pollination and crop pest control. Over 150 crops in the\nUnited States require pollination to produce. One estimate of the benefit of honeybee pollination within the United States is\n$1.6 billion per year; other pollinators contribute up to $6.7 billion more.\nMany honeybee populations are managed by apiarists who rent out their hives\u2019 services to farmers. Honeybee populations\nin North America have been suffering large losses caused by a syndrome known as colony collapse disorder, whose cause\nis unclear. Other pollinators include a diverse array of other bee species and various insects and birds. Loss of these species\nwould make growing crops requiring pollination impossible, increasing dependence on other crops.\nFinally, humans compete for their food with crop pests, most of which are insects. Pesticides control these competitors;\nhowever, pesticides are costly and lose their effectiveness over time as pest populations adapt. They also lead to collateral\ndamage by killing non-pest species and risking the health of consumers and agricultural workers. Ecologists believe that\nthe bulk of the work in removing pests is actually done by predators and parasites of those pests, but the impact has not\nbeen well studied. A review found that in 74 percent of studies that looked for an effect of landscape complexity on natural\nenemies of pests, the greater the complexity, the greater the effect of pest-suppressing organisms. An experimental study\nfound that introducing multiple enemies of pea aphids (an important alfalfa pest) increased the yield of alfalfa significantly.\nThis study shows the importance of landscape diversity via the question of whether a diversity of pests is more effective at\ncontrol than one single pest; the results showed this to be the case. Loss of diversity in pest enemies will inevitably make it\nmore difficult and costly to grow food.\n1742\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nWild Food Sources\nIn addition to growing crops and raising animals for food, humans obtain food resources from wild populations, primarily\nfish populations. For approximately 1 billion people, aquatic resources provide the main source of animal protein. But\nsince 1990, global fish production has declined. Despite considerable effort, few fisheries on the planet are managed for\nsustainability.\nFishery extinctions rarely lead to complete extinction of the harvested species, but rather to a radical restructuring of the\nmarine ecosystem in which a dominant species is so over-harvested that it becomes a minor player, ecologically. In addition\nto humans losing the food source, these alterations affect many other species in ways that are difficult or impossible to\npredict. The collapse of fisheries has dramatic and long-lasting effects on local populations that work in the fishery. In\naddition, the loss of an inexpensive protein source to populations that cannot afford to replace it will increase the cost of\nliving and limit societies in other ways. In general, the fish taken from fisheries have shifted to smaller species as larger\nspecies are fished to extinction. The ultimate outcome could clearly be the loss of aquatic systems as food sources.\nView a brief video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/declining_fish) discussing declining fish stocks.\nWhat would be the most effective approach to reversing the damage of overfishing?\na.\nBan all fishing in the oceans of the world for ten years.\nb.\nThe damage is irreparable and no measure will reverse the loss.\nc.\nFish only overabundant invasive species.\nd.\nSet aside 40% of the world's oceans as no-fishing zones with international cooperation for enforcement.\nPsychological and Moral Value\nFinally, it has been argued that humans benefit psychologically from living in a biodiverse world. A chief proponent of this\nidea is entomologist E. O. Wilson. He argues that human evolutionary history has adapted us to live in a natural environment\nand that built environments generate stressors that affect human health and well-being. There is considerable research into\nthe psychological regenerative benefits of natural landscapes that suggests the hypothesis may hold some truth. In addition,\nthere is a moral argument that humans have a responsibility to inflict as little harm as possible on other species.\n38.3 | Threats to Biodiversity\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are significant threats to biodiversity?\n\u2022\nWhat are the impacts of habitat loss, exotic species, and hunting on biodiversity?\n\u2022\nWhat are examples of early and predicted effects of climate change on biodiversity?\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe core threats to biodiversity include human population growth and the unsustainable removable of resources from\nthe environment.

        "summary": "Biodiversity is crucial to human life because it supports health, agriculture, ecosystem stability, and cultural well-being. Many modern medicines, including aspirin, codeine, and antibiotics, are derived from plants, fungi, and animal toxins, and the loss of species reduces opportunities for discovering new treatments. Agricultural diversity ensures food security by providing crops resistant to pests, diseases, and changing conditions, with wild relatives of domesticated species serving as vital genetic resources; institutions like the Svalbard Global Seed Vault help preserve this diversity. Ecosystem services such as soil nutrient cycling, pollination, and natural pest control are critical for sustainable food production. Wild food sources, especially fisheries, provide essential protein for about 1 billion people, but overfishing threatens both food supplies and ecosystems. Beyond practical needs, biodiversity offers psychological benefits, enhances human well-being through interaction with natural landscapes, and supports a moral responsibility to minimize harm to other species."

As mentioned, the three greatest proximate threats to biodiversity are habitat loss, overharvesting, and\n1744\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nintroduction of exotic species. The first two of these are a direct result of human population growth and resource use.\nThe third results from increased mobility and trade. A fourth major cause of extinction, anthropogenic climate change,\nhas not yet had a large impact, but it is predicted to become significant during this century. Global climate change is\nalso a consequence of human population needs for energy and the use of fossil fuels to meet those needs (Figure 38.10).\nEnvironmental issues, such as toxic pollution, have specific targeted effects on species, but they are not generally seen as\nthreats at the magnitude of the others.\nFigure 38.10 Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels fluctuate in a cyclical manner. However, the burning of fossil fuels in\nrecent history has caused a dramatic increase in the levels of carbon dioxide in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, which have\nnow reached levels never before seen in human history. Scientists predict that the addition of this \u201cgreenhouse gas\u201d to\nthe atmosphere is resulting in climate change that will significantly impact biodiversity in the coming century.\nHabitat Loss\nHumans rely on technology to modify their environment and replace certain functions that were once performed by the\nnatural ecosystem. Other species cannot do this. Elimination of their ecosystem\u2014whether it is a forest, a desert, a grassland,\na freshwater estuarine, or a marine environment\u2014will kill the individuals in the species. Remove the entire habitat within\nthe range of a species and, unless they are one of the few species that do well in human-built environments, the species\nwill become extinct. Human destruction of habitats accelerated in the latter half of the twentieth century. Consider the\nexceptional biodiversity of Sumatra: it is home to one species of orangutan, a species of critically endangered elephant, and\nthe Sumatran tiger, but half of Sumatra\u2019s forest is now gone. The neighboring island of Borneo, home to the other species\nof orangutan, has lost a similar area of forest. Forest loss continues in protected areas of Borneo. The orangutan in Borneo\nis listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but it is simply the most visible of\nthousands of species that will not survive the disappearance of the forests of Borneo. The forests are removed for timber\nand to plant palm oil plantations (Figure 38.11). Palm oil is used in many products including food products, cosmetics,\nand biodiesel in Europe. A five-year estimate of global forest cover loss for the years 2000\u20132005 was 3.1 percent. In the\nhumid tropics where forest loss is primarily from timber extraction, 272,000 km2 was lost out of a global total of 11,564,000\nkm2 (or 2.4 percent). In the tropics, these losses certainly also represent the extinction of species because of high levels of\nendemism.\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\n1745\nFigure 38.11 (a) One species of orangutan, Pongo pygmaeus, is found only in the rainforests of Borneo, and\nthe other species of orangutan (Pongo abelii) is found only in the rainforests of Sumatra.

Yet the market for illegally harvested tropical timber is huge, and the\nwood products often find themselves in building supply stores in the United States. One estimate is that 10\npercent of the imported timber stream in the United States, which is the world\u2019s largest consumer of wood\nproducts, is potentially illegally logged. In 2006, this amounted to $3.6 billion in wood products. Most of the\nillegal products are imported from countries that act as intermediaries and are not the originators of the\nwood.\nHow is it possible to determine if a wood product, such as flooring, was harvested sustainably or even\nlegally? The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certifies sustainably harvested forest products, therefore,\nlooking for their certification on flooring and other hardwood products is one way to ensure that the wood\nhas not been taken illegally from a tropical forest. Certification applies to specific products, not to a producer;\nsome producers\u2019 products may not have certification while other products are certified. While there are other\nindustry-backed certifications other than the FSC, these are unreliable due to lack of independence from\nthe industry. Another approach is to buy domestic wood species. While it would be great if there was a\nlist of legal versus illegal wood products, it is not that simple. Logging and forest management laws vary\nfrom country to country; what is illegal in one country may be legal in another. Where and how a product is\nharvested and whether the forest from which it comes is being maintained sustainably all factor into whether\na wood product will be certified by the FSC. It is always a good idea to ask questions about where a wood\nproduct came from and how the supplier knows that it was harvested legally.\nWhich of the following woods was most likely legally harvested?\na.\nunknown wood stacked in a corner of the store\nb.\nbird-eye maple from Vermont with a FSC certificate\nc.\nteak imported from Thailand\nd.\npurpleheart wood from the Amazon forest\nHabitat destruction can affect ecosystems other than forests. Rivers and streams are important ecosystems and are frequently\nmodified through land development and from damming or water removal. Damming of rivers affects the water flow and\naccess to all parts of a river. Differing flow regimes can reduce or eliminate populations that are adapted to these changes\nin flow patterns. For example, an estimated 91percent of river lengths in the United States have been developed: they have\nmodifications like dams, to create energy or store water; levees, to prevent flooding; or dredging or rerouting, to create land\nthat is more suitable for human development. Many fish species in the United States, especially rare species or species with\nrestricted distributions, have seen declines caused by river damming and habitat loss. Research has confirmed that species\nof amphibians that must carry out parts of their life cycles in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats have a greater chance of\nsuffering population declines and extinction because of the increased likelihood that one of their habitats or access between\nthem will be lost.\nOverharvesting\nOverharvesting is a serious threat to many species, but particularly to aquatic species. There are many examples of regulated\ncommercial fisheries monitored by fisheries scientists that have nevertheless collapsed. The western Atlantic cod fishery\nis the most spectacular recent collapse. While it was a hugely productive fishery for 400 years, the introduction of modern\nfactory trawlers in the 1980s and the pressure on the fishery led to it becoming unsustainable. The causes of fishery collapse\nare both economic and political in nature. Most fisheries are managed as a common (shared) resource even when the fishing\nterritory lies within a country\u2019s territorial waters. Common resources are subject to an economic pressure known as the\ntragedy of the commons in which essentially no fisher has a motivation to exercise restraint in harvesting a fishery when\nit is not owned by that fisher. The natural outcome of harvests of resources held in common is their overexploitation. While\nlarge fisheries are regulated to attempt to avoid this pressure, it still exists in the background. This overexploitation is\nexacerbated when access to the fishery is open and unregulated and when technology gives fishers the ability to overfish.\nIn a few fisheries, the biological growth of the resource is less than the potential growth of the profits made from fishing if\nthat time and money were invested elsewhere. In these cases\u2014whales are an example\u2014economic forces will always drive\ntoward fishing the population to extinction.\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\n1747\nExplore a U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service interactive map (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/habitat_map) of critical habitat\nfor endangered and threatened species in the United States. To begin, select \u201cVisit the online mapper.\u201d\nFor the most part, fishery extinction is not equivalent to biological extinction\u2014the last fish of a species is rarely fished out of\nthe ocean. At the same time, fishery extinction is still harmful to fish species and their ecosystems. There are some instances\nin which true extinction is a possibility. Whales have slow-growing populations and are at risk of complete extinction\nthrough hunting. There are some species of sharks with restricted distributions that are at risk of extinction. The groupers\nare another population of generally slow-growing fishes that, in the Caribbean, includes a number of species that are at risk\nof extinction from overfishing.\nCoral reefs are extremely diverse marine ecosystems that face peril from several processes. Reefs are home to 1/3 of the\nworld\u2019s marine fish species\u2014about 4,000 species\u2014despite making up only 1 percent of marine habitat. Most home marine\naquaria are stocked with wild-caught organisms, not cultured organisms. Although no species is known to have been driven\nextinct by the pet trade in marine species, there are studies showing that populations of some species have declined in\nresponse to harvesting, indicating that the harvest is not sustainable at those levels. There are concerns about the effect of\nthe pet trade on some terrestrial species such as turtles, amphibians, birds, plants, and even the orangutan.\nView a brief video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ocean_matters) discussing the role of marine ecosystems in supporting\nhuman welfare and the decline of ocean ecosystems.\nThe ocean is home to many organisms. How are some of the smallest species connected to human breathing?\na.\nPhytoplankton release over 50% of the oxygen produced on Earth through chemosynthesis.\nb.\nPhytoplankton release over 50% of the carbon dioxide produced on Earth through photosynthesis.\nc.\nPhytoplankton release over 20% of the oxygen produced on Earth through photosynthesis.\nd.\nPhytoplankton release over 50% of the oxygen produced on Earth through photosynthesis.\nBush meat is the generic term used for wild animals killed for food. Hunting is practiced throughout the world, but\nhunting practices, particularly in equatorial Africa and parts of Asia, are believed to threaten several species with extinction.\nTraditionally, bush meat in Africa was hunted to feed families directly; however, recent commercialization of the practice\nnow has bush meat available in grocery stores, which has increased harvest rates to the level of unsustainability.\nAdditionally, human population growth has increased the need for protein foods that are not being met from agriculture.\nSpecies threatened by the bush meat trade are mostly mammals including many primates living in the Congo basin.\nExotic Species\nExotic species are species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced by humans into an ecosystem in\nwhich they did not evolve. Such introductions likely occur frequently as natural phenomena. For example, Kudzu (Pueraria\nlobata), which is native to Japan, was introduced in the United States in 1876. It was later planted for soil conservation.\n1748\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nProblematically, it grows too well in the southeastern United States\u2014up to a foot a day. It is now a pest species and covers\nover 7 million acres in the southeastern United States. If an introduced species is able to survive in its new habitat, that\nintroduction is now reflected in the observed range of the species. Human transportation of people and goods, including\nthe intentional transport of organisms for trade, has dramatically increased the introduction of species into new ecosystems,\nsometimes at distances that are well beyond the capacity of the species to ever travel itself and outside the range of the\nspecies\u2019 natural predators.\nMost exotic species introductions probably fail because of the low number of individuals introduced or poor adaptation to\nthe ecosystem they enter. Some species, however, possess preadaptations that can make them especially successful in a new\necosystem. These exotic species often undergo dramatic population increases in their new habitat and reset the ecological\nconditions in the new environment, threatening the species that exist there. For this reason, exotic species are also called\ninvasive species. Exotic species can threaten other species through competition for resources, predation, or disease.\nExplore an interactive global database (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/exotic_invasive) of exotic or invasive species.\nHow do iguanas propagate themselves and other invasive species?\na.\nIguanas interbreed with invasive species and their offspring continue to breed.\nb.\nIguanas consume other exotic animal and seed species.\nc.\nIguanas reproduce in urban settings and defecate the seeds of invasive plants.\nd.\nIguanas reproduce in settings where other invasive species thrive.\nLakes and islands are particularly vulnerable to extinction threats from introduced species. In Lake Victoria, as mentioned\nearlier, the intentional introduction of the Nile perch was largely responsible for the extinction of about 200 species of\ncichlids. The accidental introduction of the brown tree snake via aircraft (Figure 38.12) from the Solomon Islands to Guam\nin 1950 has led to the extinction of three species of birds and three to five species of reptiles endemic to the island. Several\nother species are still threatened. The brown tree snake is adept at exploiting human transportation as a means to migrate;\none was even found on an aircraft arriving in Corpus Christi, Texas. Constant vigilance on the part of airport, military,\nand commercial aircraft personnel is required to prevent the snake from moving from Guam to other islands in the Pacific,\nespecially Hawaii. Islands do not make up a large area of land on the globe, but they do contain a disproportionate number\nof endemic species because of their isolation from mainland ancestors.\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\n1749\nFigure 38.12 The brown tree snake, Boiga irregularis, is an exotic species that has caused numerous extinctions on\nthe island of Guam since its accidental introduction in 1950. (credit: NPS)\nIt now appears that the global decline in amphibian species recognized in the 1990s is, in some part, caused by the fungus\nBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which causes the disease chytridiomycosis (Figure 38.13). There is evidence that the\nfungus is native to Africa and may have been spread throughout the world by transport of a commonly used laboratory\nand pet species: the African clawed toad (Xenopus laevis). It may well be that biologists themselves are responsible for\nspreading this disease worldwide. The North American bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, which has also been widely introduced\nas a food animal but which easily escapes captivity, survives most infections of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and can\nact as a reservoir for the disease.\nFigure 38.13 This Limosa Harlequin Frog (Atelopus limosus), an endangered species from Panama, died from a fungal\ndisease called chytridiomycosis. The red lesions are symptomatic of the disease. (credit: Brian Gratwicke)\nEarly evidence suggests that another fungal pathogen, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, introduced from Europe is\nresponsible for white-nose syndrome, which infects cave-hibernating bats in eastern North America and has spread from\na point of origin in western New York State (Figure 38.14). The disease has decimated bat populations and threatens\nextinction of species already listed as endangered: the Indiana bat, Myotis sodalis, and potentially the Virginia big-eared\nbat, Corynorhinus townsendii virginianus. How the fungus was introduced is unclear, but one logical presumption would be\nthat recreational cavers unintentionally brought the fungus on clothes or equipment from Europe.\n1750\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 38.14 This little brown bat in Greeley Mine, Vermont, March 26, 2009, was found to have white-nose syndrome.\n(credit: Marvin Moriarty, USFWS)\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\n1751\nInvasive plants can also destroy native habitats. The Brazilian pepper tree pictured below was brought in to\nFlorida in the 1800s. Now widespread throughout Florida, it produces a dense canopy, creating too much\nshade for native plant species to thrive.\nFigure 38.15 (credit: Forest Starr & Kim Starr)\nPopulations of bats in many habitats are declining because of an infection referred to as white-nose syndrome.

Introducing a non-native species into an established community can have a\nnumber of possible effects. Using your local environment for inspiration, predict some of these effects.\nWhat factors should be considered before the importation of non-native or invasive species? Design a\ncampaign that highlights the dangers of importing a specific non\u2013native or invasive species into your local\nenvironment.\nClimate Change\nClimate change, and specifically the anthropogenic (meaning, caused by humans) warming trend presently underway, is\nrecognized as a major extinction threat, particularly when combined with other threats such as habitat loss. Scientists\ndisagree about the likely magnitude of the effects, with extinction rate estimates ranging from 15 percent to 40 percent\nof species committed to extinction by 2050. Scientists do agree, however, that climate change will alter regional climates,\nincluding rainfall and snowfall patterns, making habitats less hospitable to the species living in them. The warming trend\nwill shift colder climates toward the north and south poles, forcing species to move with their adapted climate norms\n1752\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nwhile facing habitat gaps along the way. The shifting ranges will impose new competitive regimes on species as they find\nthemselves in contact with other species not present in their historic range. One such unexpected species contact is between\npolar bears and grizzly bears. Previously, these two species had separate ranges. Now, their ranges are overlapping and\nthere are documented cases of these two species mating and producing viable offspring. Changing climates also throw\noff species\u2019 delicate timing adaptations to seasonal food resources and breeding times. Many contemporary mismatches to\nshifts in resource availability and timing have already been documented.\nFigure 38.16 Since 2008, grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) have been spotted farther north than their historic\nrange, a possible consequence of climate change. As a result, grizzly bear habitat now overlaps polar bear\n(Ursus maritimus) habitat. The two kinds of bears, which are capable of mating and producing viable offspring, are\nconsidered separate species as historically they lived in different habitats and never met. However, in 2006 a hunter\nshot a wild grizzly-polar bear hybrid known as a grolar bear, the first wild hybrid ever found.\nRange shifts are already being observed: for example, some European bird species ranges have moved 91 km northward.\nThe same study suggested that the optimal shift based on warming trends was double that distance, suggesting that the\npopulations are not moving quickly enough. Range shifts have also been observed in plants, butterflies, other insects,\nfreshwater fishes, reptiles, and mammals.\nClimate gradients will also move up mountains, eventually crowding species higher in altitude and eliminating the habitat\nfor those species adapted to the highest elevations. Some climates will completely disappear. The rate of warming appears\nto be accelerated in the arctic, which is recognized as a serious threat to polar bear populations that require sea ice to hunt\nseals during the winter months: seals are the only source of protein available to polar bears. A trend to decreasing sea ice\ncoverage has occurred since observations began in the mid-twentieth century. The rate of decline observed in recent years\nis far greater than previously predicted by climate models.\nFinally, global warming will raise ocean levels due to melt water from glaciers and the greater volume of warmer water.\nShorelines will be inundated, reducing island size, which will have an effect on some species, and a number of islands will\ndisappear entirely. Additionally, the gradual melting and subsequent refreezing of the poles, glaciers, and higher elevation\nmountains\u2014a cycle that has provided freshwater to environments for centuries\u2014will also be jeopardized. This could result\nin an overabundance of salt water and a shortage of fresh water.\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\n1753\n38.4 | Preserving Biodiversity\nIn this section, you will explore the following questions:\n\u2022\nWhat are examples of new technologies for measuring biodiversity and legislative framework for conservation?\n\u2022\nWhat are the principles and challenges of conservation preserve design?\n\u2022\nWhat are examples of the effects of habitat restoration and the roles of zoos in biodiversity conservation\nConnection for AP\u00ae Courses\nThe information in this section does not directly apply to concepts and content required for AP\u00ae.

        "summary": "The major threats to biodiversity stem from human population growth and unsustainable resource use, with the most significant being habitat loss, overharvesting, the introduction of exotic species, and the escalating impacts of climate change. Habitat destruction, such as deforestation for timber and palm oil plantations, river damming, and land development, eradicates ecosystems and drives species\u2014especially those with limited ranges\u2014toward extinction. Overharvesting, including overfishing, hunting for bush meat, and unsustainable wildlife trade, depletes species faster than they can replenish, causing ecosystem imbalances. Exotic species, introduced intentionally or accidentally, often become invasive, outcompeting native species, spreading disease, and causing extinctions, as seen with the Nile perch in Lake Victoria, the brown tree snake in Guam, and fungal pathogens devastating amphibians and bats. Climate change exacerbates these threats by shifting habitats, altering temperature and precipitation patterns, disrupting species\u2019 life cycles, and diminishing critical environments like polar ice and mountain ecosystems, potentially committing 15\u201340% of species to extinction by 2050."

The legislation includes international treaties as well\nas national and state laws. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)\ntreaty came into force in 1975. The treaty, and the national legislation that supports it, provides a legal framework for\npreventing approximately 33,000 listed species from being transported across nations\u2019 borders, thus protecting them from\nbeing caught or killed when international trade is involved. The treaty is limited in its reach because it only deals with\ninternational movement of organisms or their parts. It is also limited by various countries\u2019 ability or willingness to enforce\nthe treaty and supporting legislation. The illegal trade in organisms and their parts is probably a market in the hundreds of\nmillions of dollars. Illegal wildlife trade is monitored by another non-profit: Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in\nCommerce (TRAFFIC).\nWithin many countries there are laws that protect endangered species and regulate hunting and fishing. In the United States,\nthe Endangered Species Act (ESA) was enacted in 1973. Species at risk are listed by the Act; the U.S. Fish & Wildlife\nService is required by law to develop management plans that protect the listed species and bring them back to sustainable\nnumbers. The Act, and others like it in other countries, is a useful tool, but it suffers because it is often difficult to get a\nspecies listed, or to get an effective management plan in place once it is listed. Additionally, species may be controversially\ntaken off the list without necessarily having had a change in their situation. More fundamentally, the approach to protecting\nindividual species rather than entire ecosystems is both inefficient and focuses efforts on a few highly visible and often\ncharismatic species, perhaps at the expense of other species that go unprotected. At the same time, the Act has a critical\nhabitat provision outlined in the recovery mechanism that may benefit species other than the one targeted for management.\nThe Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) is an agreement between the United States and Canada that was signed into law\nin 1918 in response to declines in North American bird species caused by hunting. The Act now lists over 800 protected\nspecies. It makes it illegal to disturb or kill the protected species or distribute their parts (much of the hunting of birds in the\npast was for their feathers).\nThe international response to global warming has been mixed. The Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement that came\nout of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that committed countries to reducing greenhouse gas\nemissions by 2012, was ratified by some countries, but spurned by others. Two important countries in terms of their potential\nimpact that did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol were the United States and China. The United States rejected it as a result of\na powerful fossil fuel industry and China because of a concern it would stifle the nation\u2019s growth. Some goals for reduction\nin greenhouse gasses were met and exceeded by individual countries, but worldwide, the effort to limit greenhouse gas\nproduction is not succeeding. The intended replacement for the Kyoto Protocol has not materialized because governments\ncannot agree on timelines and benchmarks. Meanwhile, climate scientists predict the resulting costs to human societies and\nbiodiversity will be high.\nAs already mentioned, the private non-profit sector plays a large role in the conservation effort both in North America and\naround the world. The approaches range from species-specific organizations to the broadly focused IUCN and TRAFFIC.\nThe Nature Conservancy takes a novel approach. It purchases land and protects it in an attempt to set up preserves for\necosystems. Ultimately, human behavior will change when human values change. At present, the growing urbanization of\nthe human population is a force that poses challenges to the valuing of biodiversity.\nConservation in Preserves\nEstablishment of wildlife and ecosystem preserves is one of the key tools in conservation efforts. A preserve is an area of\nland set aside with varying degrees of protection for the organisms that exist within the boundaries of the preserve. Preserves\ncan be effective in the short term for protecting both species and ecosystems, but they face challenges that scientists are still\nexploring to strengthen their viability as long-term solutions.\nHow Much Area to Preserve?\nDue to the way protected lands are allocated (they tend to contain less economically valuable resources rather than being\nset aside specifically for the species or ecosystems at risk) and the way biodiversity is distributed, determining a target\npercentage of land or marine habitat that should be protected to maintain biodiversity levels is challenging. The IUCN World\nParks Congress estimated that 11.5 percent of Earth\u2019s land surface was covered by preserves of various kinds in 2003. This\narea is greater than previous goals; however, it only represents 9 out of 14 recognized major biomes. Research has shown\n1756\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nthat 12 percent of all species live only outside preserves; these percentages are much higher when only threatened species\nand high quality preserves are considered. For example, high quality preserves include only about 50 percent of threatened\namphibian species. The conclusion must be that either the percentage of area protected must increase, or the percentage\nof high quality preserves must increase, or preserves must be targeted with greater attention to biodiversity protection.\nResearchers argue that more attention to the latter solution is required.\nPreserve Design\nThere has been extensive research into optimal preserve designs for maintaining biodiversity. The fundamental principle\nbehind much of the research has been the seminal theoretical work of Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson\npublished in 1967 on island biogeography.\n[5] This work sought to understand the factors affecting biodiversity on islands.\nThe fundamental conclusion was that biodiversity on an island was a function of the origin of species through migration,\nspeciation, and extinction on that island. Islands farther from a mainland are harder to get to, so migration is lower and the\nequilibrium number of species is lower. Within island populations, evidence suggests that the number of species gradually\nincreases to a level similar to the numbers on the mainland from which the species is suspected to have migrated. In\naddition, smaller islands are harder to find, so their immigration rates for new species are lower. Smaller islands are also\nless geographically diverse so there are fewer niches to promote speciation. And finally, smaller islands support smaller\npopulations, so the probability of extinction is higher.\nAs islands get larger, the number of species accelerates, although the effect of island area on species numbers is not a\ndirect correlation. Conservation preserves can be seen as \u201cislands\u201d of habitat within \u201can ocean\u201d of non-habitat. For a species\nto persist in a preserve, the preserve must be large enough. The critical size depends, in part, on the home range that\nis characteristic of the species. A preserve for wolves, which range hundreds of kilometers, must be much larger than a\npreserve for butterflies, which might range within ten kilometers during its lifetime. But larger preserves have more core\narea of optimal habitat for individual species, they have more niches to support more species, and they attract more species\nbecause they can be found and reached more easily.\nPreserves perform better when there are buffer zones around them of suboptimal habitat. The buffer allows organisms to\nexit the boundaries of the preserve without immediate negative consequences from predation or lack of resources. One large\npreserve is better than the same area of several smaller preserves because there is more core habitat unaffected by edges.\nFor this same reason, preserves in the shape of a square or circle will be better than a preserve with many thin \u201carms.\u201d If\npreserves must be smaller, then providing wildlife corridors between them so that individuals and their genes can move\nbetween the preserves, for example along rivers and streams, will make the smaller preserves behave more like a large one.\nAll of these factors are taken into consideration when planning the nature of a preserve before the land is set aside.\nIn addition to the physical, biological, and ecological specifications of a preserve, there are a variety of policy, legislative,\nand enforcement specifications related to uses of the preserve for functions other than protection of species. These can\ninclude anything from timber extraction, mineral extraction, regulated hunting, human habitation, and nondestructive\nhuman recreation. Many of these policy decisions are made based on political pressures rather than conservation\nconsiderations. In some cases, wildlife protection policies have been so strict that subsistence-living indigenous populations\nhave been forced from ancestral lands that fell within a preserve. In other cases, even if a preserve is designed to protect\nwildlife, if the protections are not or cannot be enforced, the preserve status will have little meaning in the face of illegal\npoaching and timber extraction. This is a widespread problem with preserves in areas of the tropics.\nLimitations on Preserves\nSome of the limitations on preserves as conservation tools are evident from the discussion of preserve design. Political and\neconomic pressures typically make preserves smaller, never larger, so setting aside areas that are large enough is difficult.\nIf the area set aside is sufficiently large, there may not be sufficient area to create a buffer around the preserve. In this case,\nan area on the outer edges of the preserve inevitably becomes a riskier suboptimal habitat for the species in the preserve.\nEnforcement of protections is also a significant issue in countries without the resources or political will to prevent poaching\nand illegal resource extraction.\nClimate change will create inevitable problems with the location of preserves. The species within them will migrate to\nhigher latitudes as the habitat of the preserve becomes less favorable. Scientists are planning for the effects of global\nwarming on future preserves and striving to predict the need for new preserves to accommodate anticipated changes to\nhabitats; however, the end effectiveness is tenuous since these efforts are prediction based.\nFinally, an argument can be made that conservation preserves reinforce the cultural perception that humans are separate\nfrom nature, can exist outside of it, and can only operate in ways that do damage to biodiversity. Creating preserves reduces\nthe pressure on human activities outside the preserves to be sustainable and non-damaging to biodiversity. Ultimately, the\npolitical, economic, and human demographic pressures will degrade and reduce the size of conservation preserves if the\nactivities outside them are not altered to be less damaging to biodiversity.\n5.

Of course once\na species has become extinct, its restoration is impossible. However, restoration can improve the biodiversity of degraded\necosystems. Reintroducing wolves, a top predator, to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 led to dramatic changes in the\necosystem that increased biodiversity. The wolves (Figure 38.18) function to suppress elk and coyote populations and\nprovide more abundant resources to the guild of carrion eaters. Reducing elk populations has allowed revegetation of\nriparian areas, which has increased the diversity of species in that habitat. Decreasing the coyote population has increased\nthe populations of species that were previously suppressed by this predator. The number of species of carrion eaters has\nincreased because of the predatory activities of the wolves. In this habitat, the wolf is a keystone species, meaning a species\nthat is instrumental in maintaining diversity in an ecosystem. Removing a keystone species from an ecological community\nmay cause a collapse in diversity. The results from the Yellowstone experiment suggest that restoring a keystone species can\nhave the effect of restoring biodiversity in the community. Ecologists have argued for the identification of keystone species\nwhere possible and for focusing protection efforts on those species; likewise, it also makes sense to attempt to return them\nto their ecosystem if they have been removed.\n1758\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6\nFigure 38.18 (a) The Gibbon wolf pack in Yellowstone National Park, March 1, 2007, represents a keystone species.\nThe reintroduction of wolves into Yellowstone National Park in 1995 led to a change in the grazing behavior of (b)\nelk. To avoid predation, the elk no longer grazed exposed stream and riverbeds, such as (c) the Lamar Riverbed in\nYellowstone. This allowed willow and cottonwood seedlings to grow. The seedlings decreased erosion and provided\nshading to the creek, which improved fish habitat. A new colony of (d) beaver may also have benefited from the habitat\nchange.

In the United States, since the mid-1980s, many\naging dams are being considered for removal rather than replacement because of shifting beliefs about the ecological value\nof free-flowing rivers and because many dams no longer provide the benefit and functions that they did when they were first\nbuilt. The measured benefits of dam removal include restoration of naturally fluctuating water levels (the purpose of dams\nis frequently to reduce variation in river flows), which leads to increased fish diversity and improved water quality. In the\nPacific Northwest, dam removal projects are expected to increase populations of salmon, which is considered a keystone\nspecies because it transports key nutrients to inland ecosystems during its annual spawning migrations. In other regions\nsuch as the Atlantic coast, dam removal has allowed the return of spawning anadromous fish species (species that are born\nin fresh water, live most of their lives in salt water, and return to fresh water to spawn). Some of the largest dam removal\nprojects have yet to occur or have happened too recently for the consequences to be measured. The large-scale ecological\nexperiments that these removal projects constitute will provide valuable data for other dam projects slated either for removal\nor construction.\nThe Role of Captive Breeding\nZoos have sought to play a role in conservation efforts both through captive breeding programs and education. The\ntransformation of the missions of zoos from collection and exhibition facilities to organizations that are dedicated to\nconservation is ongoing. In general, it has been recognized that, except in some specific targeted cases, captive breeding\nprograms for endangered species are inefficient and often prone to failure when the species are reintroduced to the wild.\nZoo facilities are far too limited to contemplate captive breeding programs for the numbers of species that are now at\nrisk. Education is another potential positive impact of zoos on conservation efforts, particularly given the global trend\nto urbanization and the consequent reduction in contacts between people and wildlife. A number of studies have been\nperformed to look at the effectiveness of zoos on people\u2019s attitudes and actions regarding conservation; at present, the results\ntend to be mixed.\nChapter 38 | Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\n1759\nadaptive radiation\nbiodiversity\nbiodiversity hotspot\nbush meat\nchemical diversity\nchytridiomycosis\nDNA barcoding\necosystem diversity\nendemic species\nexotic species\nextinction\nextinction rate\ngenetic diversity\nheterogeneity\nmegafauna\nsecondary plant compound\nspecies-area relationship\ntragedy of the commons\nwhite-nose syndrome\nKEY TERMS\nrapid branching through speciation of a phylogenetic tree into many closely related species\nvariety of a biological system, typically conceived as the number of species, but also applying to genes,\nbiochemistry, and ecosystems\nconcept originated by Norman Myers to describe a geographical region with a large number of\nendemic species and a large percentage of degraded habitat\nwild-caught animal used as food (typically mammals, birds, and reptiles); usually referring to hunting in the\ntropics of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and the Americas\nvariety of metabolic compounds in an ecosystem\ndisease of amphibians caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; thought to be a major\ncause of the global amphibian decline\nmolecular genetic method for identifying a unique genetic sequence to associate with a species\nvariety of ecosystems\nspecies native to one place\n(also, invasive species) species that has been introduced to an ecosystem in which it did not evolve\ndisappearance of a species from Earth; local extinction is the disappearance of a species from a region\nnumber of species becoming extinct over time, sometimes defined as extinctions per million\nspecies\u2013years to make numbers manageable (E/MSY)\nvariety of genes in a species or other taxonomic group or ecosystem, the term can refer to allelic\ndiversity or genome-wide diversity\nnumber of ecological niches\nlarge animals\ncompound produced as byproducts of plant metabolic processes that is usually toxic, but\nis sequestered by the plant to defend against herbivores\nrelationship between area surveyed and number of species encountered; typically measured\nby incrementally increasing the area of a survey and determining the cumulative numbers of species\neconomic principle that resources held in common will inevitably be overexploited\ndisease of cave-hibernating bats in the eastern United States and Canada associated with the\nfungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans",
        "summary": "Preserving biodiversity involves understanding species and ecosystems, changing human behaviors, and implementing diverse conservation strategies. Modern technologies like DNA barcoding enable efficient identification and cataloging of species, while organizations such as the IUCN assess and track threatened species. Legislative measures, including international treaties like CITES and national laws like the Endangered Species Act, seek to protect species, though they face challenges in enforcement and scope. Conservation efforts increasingly focus on preserving entire ecosystems through wildlife preserves, whose effectiveness depends on size, design, buffer zones, and connectivity, but are limited by political, economic, and climatic pressures. Habitat restoration, such as the reintroduction of keystone species and dam removal, can significantly boost biodiversity, while zoos contribute through education and limited captive breeding programs. Ultimately, successful biodiversity preservation requires integrated approaches that combine science, policy, habitat protection, and restoration efforts."
