Recognise (remembering),Name a gland in the body that has both exocrine and endocrine function,The pancreas is a gland that has both exocrine and endocrine functions.,Correctly names the pancreas as a gland with both exocrine and endocrine functions without errors or omissions.,Names the pancreas as the correct gland but may include minor unrelated information or slight wording errors.,"Names a gland, but the answer is incorrect or does not clearly state the pancreas; shows some understanding but lacks accuracy.",Does not name any gland or gives an unrelated or unclear response; shows little or no understanding of the question.,The thyroid gland is a gland in the body that has both exocrine and endocrine functions because it releases hormones into the blood and also helps with digestion.,Developing,"Your answer shows some understanding of the question, as you correctly identified that glands can release hormones into the blood, but the thyroid gland is not the correct example of a gland with both exocrine and endocrine functions. The correct gland is the pancreas, which releases hormones into the blood (endocrine function) and also produces digestive enzymes that are released into the digestive tract (exocrine function). To improve, focus on accurately identifying the pancreas as the gland with both functions and ensure your explanation matches its specific roles."
Identify (remembering),Name a human cell that is haploid,A sperm cell is a human cell that is haploid.,"Correctly names a human haploid cell (e.g., sperm cell or egg cell) with no errors.",Names a human haploid cell but has a minor mistake in spelling or wording that does not affect understanding.,Attempts to name a cell but gives an incorrect or non-haploid human cell.,Does not name any cell or gives an unrelated answer.,"A human gamete, like a sperm cell or an egg cell, is haploid because it contains only one set of chromosomes.",Advanced,"Your answer correctly identifies both sperm cells and egg cells as examples of human haploid cells and clearly explains that they contain only one set of chromosomes, demonstrating a strong understanding of the concept. The explanation adds clarity and shows you grasp why these cells are haploid, which strengthens your response. Overall, your answer is accurate and complete, with no errors."
Recognise (remembering),What is the significance of the internal structure of the mitonchodria,"The internal structure of the mitochondria, especially the folded inner membrane called cristae, increases the surface area for important chemical reactions that produce energy for the cell.",Clearly recognises the internal structure of the mitochondria (such as cristae or folded inner membrane) and accurately states its significance in increasing surface area for energy production.,"Recognises the internal structure of the mitochondria and mentions its role in energy production, but the explanation of how the structure helps may be brief or less detailed.",Mentions the mitochondria or its internal structure but gives an incomplete or unclear statement about its significance.,Does not recognise the internal structure of the mitochondria or does not state its significance.,The internal structure of the mitochondria is important because it has folds called cristae that help increase the surface area inside. This lets more reactions happen that make energy for the cell. The structure also helps separate different parts so that the reactions can be more efficient. Mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the cell because of this.,Advanced,"You clearly identify the cristae as folds in the internal structure of the mitochondria and accurately explain that these folds increase the surface area, allowing more reactions to occur for energy production, which demonstrates a strong understanding of their significance. Additionally, you mention that the structure helps separate different parts to make reactions more efficient, which adds further detail to your explanation. Your answer effectively connects the structure to its function in energy production, showing a thorough grasp of the concept. To further strengthen your response, you could focus more specifically on how the increased surface area directly supports the chemical reactions involved in energy production, rather than general efficiency, but overall your answer is clear and well-developed."
Classify (understanding),Classify joints into different types,"Joints can be classified into three main types: fibrous joints, cartilaginous joints, and synovial joints. Fibrous joints do not move and are held together by tough tissue, like the sutures in the skull. Cartilaginous joints allow some movement and are connected by cartilage, such as the joints between the vertebrae in the spine. Synovial joints are freely movable and have a fluid-filled space, like the knee, elbow, and shoulder joints.","Correctly identifies all three main types of joints (fibrous, cartilaginous, synovial) and accurately describes each type, including movement and examples.","Identifies all three main types of joints and gives a mostly accurate description of each, but may have minor errors or miss one example.","Identifies two main types of joints with basic descriptions, or lists all three types with unclear or incomplete explanations.",Identifies only one type of joint or gives incorrect or very incomplete classifications and explanations.,"Joints are the parts where bones meet and they are mainly two types, movable and immovable. Movable joints are like the knee and elbow, and immovable joints are like the skull. Joints help the body to move in different directions.",Developing,"Your answer shows an understanding that joints can be classified based on their movement, and you correctly mention examples like the knee, elbow, and skull. However, to improve, you should identify all three main types of joints—fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial—and describe each one more specifically. For instance, fibrous joints are immovable and found in the skull, cartilaginous joints allow limited movement and are found between the vertebrae, and synovial joints are freely movable, such as the knee and elbow. Expanding your answer to include these details would make your classification more complete and accurate."
Compare (understanding),Compare genetic and epigenetic mechanisms,"Genetic mechanisms involve changes in the DNA sequence, such as mutations, that are passed from parents to offspring and can affect traits. Epigenetic mechanisms do not change the DNA sequence but involve chemical modifications, like DNA methylation or histone modification, that affect how genes are turned on or off. Both influence how traits are expressed, but genetic changes are permanent, while epigenetic changes can be reversible and influenced by the environment.","Clearly compares both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms by accurately describing each, explaining how they are different, and mentioning how both affect gene expression or traits. Includes details on DNA sequence changes for genetics and chemical modifications for epigenetics.",Compares genetic and epigenetic mechanisms by describing both and noting at least one main difference. May miss some detail about how they affect gene expression or traits.,"Describes one mechanism clearly and attempts to mention the other, but the comparison is unclear or missing important differences. May confuse the two or provide incomplete information.",Gives minimal or inaccurate information about genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Does not compare them or shows misunderstanding of the concepts.,"Genetic mechanisms involve changes to the actual DNA sequence, like mutations, which can be inherited and directly affect the function of genes. Epigenetic mechanisms, on the other hand, don't change the DNA sequence itself but instead involve modifications like DNA methylation or histone modification that influence how genes are turned on or off. While genetic changes are permanent unless reversed by another mutation, epigenetic changes can be reversible and are often influenced by environmental factors. Both mechanisms play important roles in how traits are expressed and can contribute to diseases, but they operate at different levels of gene regulation.",Advanced,"Your answer provides a clear and accurate comparison between genetic and epigenetic mechanisms by describing how genetic mechanisms involve changes to the DNA sequence, such as mutations, and how epigenetic mechanisms involve chemical modifications like DNA methylation or histone modification without altering the DNA sequence itself. You effectively explain the difference in permanence between the two and note that both impact gene expression and traits. Additionally, you mention the influence of environmental factors on epigenetic changes and the potential for both mechanisms to contribute to diseases, which adds depth to your response. To further strengthen your answer, you could clarify that genetic changes are inherited from parents, as this detail helps distinguish the heritability aspect of genetic mechanisms. Overall, your response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic and addresses all key points required for a thorough comparison."
Describe (understanding),Describe the role of tRNA.,"tRNA, or transfer RNA, helps carry amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis. It matches its anticodon with the codon on mRNA to make sure the correct amino acid is added to the growing protein chain.","Clearly describes that tRNA carries amino acids to the ribosome, explains its role in matching anticodons to mRNA codons, and connects this to building a protein chain.","Describes that tRNA carries amino acids and matches with mRNA codons, but may not fully explain how this builds a protein.","Mentions that tRNA carries amino acids or is involved in protein synthesis, but gives little detail about matching codons or the process.","Gives incorrect or very minimal information about tRNA, with no clear description of its role.",tRNA is a molecule in cells that helps make proteins. It brings amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis. tRNA matches up with the mRNA to make sure the right amino acids are added.,Proficient,"Your answer accurately states that tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosome and helps ensure the correct amino acids are added by matching with mRNA, which shows a good understanding of its main functions. However, to strengthen your response, you could explain that tRNA uses its anticodon to pair specifically with codons on the mRNA, and clarify that this process is essential for building the protein chain in the correct order. Overall, your answer is clear and mostly complete, but adding these details would provide a more thorough explanation of tRNA’s role."
Explain (understanding),Explain what causes pulse and state the average pulse rate in humans,"A pulse is caused by the regular beating of the heart, which pushes blood through the arteries. Each time the heart beats, it creates a wave of pressure that can be felt as a pulse in places like the wrist or neck. The average pulse rate in humans is about 60 to 100 beats per minute.","Clearly explains that the pulse is caused by the heart beating and pushing blood through the arteries, mentions that the pulse is a wave of pressure, and accurately states the average pulse rate in humans (60 to 100 beats per minute).","Explains that the pulse is caused by the heart beating and moving blood, and states the average pulse rate in humans, with minor detail missing or slightly imprecise rate.","Gives a basic idea that the pulse relates to the heart or blood movement, but explanation is unclear or incomplete, and gives an approximate or incomplete average pulse rate.","Gives little or incorrect explanation of what causes a pulse and does not state the average pulse rate, or both parts are missing.",The pulse is caused by blood moving in the veins and it happens when the heart beats. The average pulse rate in humans is about 200 beats per minute.,Emerging,"Your answer shows an understanding that the pulse is related to the heart beating and blood movement, but it incorrectly states that the pulse is caused by blood moving in the veins rather than the arteries, and it does not mention the wave of pressure created by the heartbeat. Additionally, the average pulse rate you provided is much higher than the typical range for humans, which is about 60 to 100 beats per minute. To improve, focus on specifying that the pulse is a wave of pressure in the arteries caused by the heart's contractions, and ensure the average pulse rate is accurately stated."
Illustrate (understanding),Illustrate the economic importance of bacteria.,"Bacteria are important for the economy because they help in many ways. They are used to make foods like cheese, yogurt, and vinegar. Bacteria help in breaking down waste and cleaning the environment. They are used in medicine to make antibiotics and vaccines. Bacteria also help plants grow by fixing nitrogen in the soil, which helps farmers produce more crops.","Clearly illustrates multiple ways bacteria are economically important, including food production, medicine, environmental roles, and agriculture, with accurate details for each area.","Illustrates at least two ways bacteria are economically important, such as food production and medicine, with mostly accurate details.","Mentions one way bacteria are economically important, with some basic detail, or lists several ways without clear illustration or explanation.","Provides a vague or incomplete answer, with little or no accurate illustration of the economic importance of bacteria.","Bacteria play a huge role in the economy because they are used in many industries. In agriculture, they help improve soil fertility by fixing nitrogen, which helps crops grow better. In food production, bacteria are essential for making products like yogurt, cheese, and vinegar. They are also important in medicine because they are used to produce antibiotics and vaccines. Additionally, bacteria help break down waste in sewage treatment, making the process more efficient and protecting the environment. Overall, bacteria contribute a lot to food, health, agriculture, and waste management, making them very important economically.",Advanced,"Your answer effectively explains several key ways bacteria are economically important, including their roles in agriculture through nitrogen fixation, in food production for making products like yogurt, cheese, and vinegar, in medicine for producing antibiotics and vaccines, and in environmental management by aiding sewage treatment. You provide accurate and relevant details for each area, clearly showing how bacteria contribute to food, health, agriculture, and waste management. This demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic and covers all major aspects required. To further strengthen your response, you could include a bit more detail on how bacteria specifically benefit each industry, such as mentioning how their use in waste treatment not only protects the environment but also reduces costs for municipalities, or how their role in food production supports large-scale manufacturing. Overall, your answer is thorough and well-explained."
Apply (applying),"Use the data below to analyze the effect of temperature on enzyme activity. Identify the optimum temperature and support your answer with evidence from the data.
Temperature (°C) – Time to complete reaction (s) – Reaction Rate (1/time)
10 °C – 120 s – 0.008
20 °C – 60 s – 0.017
30 °C – 30 s – 0.033
40 °C – 20 s – 0.050
50 °C – 35 s – 0.029
60 °C – 90 s – 0.011","As the temperature increases from 10°C to 40°C, the enzyme activity also increases because the reaction rate gets higher (from 0.008 at 10°C to 0.050 at 40°C). The optimum temperature is 40°C, where the reaction rate is the highest (0.050). After 40°C, the reaction rate decreases (0.029 at 50°C and 0.011 at 60°C), showing that enzyme activity drops at higher temperatures. This means 40°C is the best temperature for enzyme activity, based on the data.","Correctly analyzes the effect of temperature on enzyme activity across all data points, clearly identifies 40°C as the optimum temperature, and supports the answer with accurate evidence from the reaction rates before and after the optimum.","Analyzes the effect of temperature on enzyme activity with minor detail missing, correctly identifies 40°C as the optimum temperature, and supports the answer with some relevant evidence from the data.","Attempts to analyze the effect of temperature but with incomplete or unclear explanation, may identify the optimum temperature but with weak or limited evidence from the data.","Provides little or incorrect analysis of temperature's effect, does not identify the optimum temperature or gives no evidence from the data.","As the temperature goes up, the enzyme activity gets faster because the reaction rate increases. The fastest reaction rate happens at 40°C, which means that is the optimum temperature. After that, the reaction rate starts to go down at 50°C and 60°C. This shows that enzymes work best at 40°C and don’t work as well at higher temperatures.",Proficient,"You clearly identified 40°C as the optimum temperature for enzyme activity and explained that the reaction rate increases as temperature rises up to this point, then decreases at higher temperatures. Your answer accurately describes the overall trend, but it would be stronger if you included specific reaction rate values from the data to support your points, such as mentioning that the rate increases from 0.008 at 10°C to 0.050 at 40°C, and then drops to 0.029 at 50°C and 0.011 at 60°C. Including these details would provide clearer evidence for your analysis and make your explanation more precise."
Measure (applying),"Using the data below, calculate the percentage increase in heart rate from resting to post-exercise for each person.
Person A: Resting HR = 68 bpm, Post-Exercise HR = 110 bpm
Person B: Resting HR = 72 bpm, Post-Exercise HR = 130 bpm
Person C: Resting HR = 75 bpm, Post-Exercise HR = 140 bpm","To calculate the percentage increase in heart rate, use the formula: ((Post-Exercise HR - Resting HR) / Resting HR) x 100.

Person A: ((110 - 68) / 68) x 100 = (42 / 68) x 100 ≈ 61.76%
Person B: ((130 - 72) / 72) x 100 = (58 / 72) x 100 ≈ 80.56%
Person C: ((140 - 75) / 75) x 100 = (65 / 75) x 100 ≈ 86.67%","Accurately applies the percentage increase formula for all three persons, shows all calculation steps, and reports all answers rounded correctly to two decimal places.","Correctly applies the percentage increase formula for all three persons and reports all answers, with minor rounding or calculation errors.","Applies the percentage increase formula to one or two persons correctly, or shows correct steps but makes calculation errors in more than one answer.","Does not apply the correct formula, or provides incomplete, mostly incorrect, or missing answers for most persons.","To find the percentage increase, just subtract the resting heart rate from the post-exercise one and that’s the answer. So for Person A it’s 110 minus 68 which is 42 percent. For Person B it’s 130 minus 72, so 58 percent. For Person C it’s 140 minus 75 which is 65 percent increase.",Emerging,"You correctly identified the need to find the difference between the post-exercise and resting heart rates for each person, but you did not use the full percentage increase formula, which requires dividing that difference by the resting heart rate and then multiplying by 100. As a result, your answers represent the absolute difference rather than the percentage increase, and the calculations do not match the expected format or rounding. To improve, make sure to apply the complete formula and show each calculation step, then round your final answers to two decimal places as required."
Pose (applying),Pose a hypothesis to test how pH affects the rate of enzyme activity in catalase,"If the pH of the solution is changed, then the rate of catalase enzyme activity will increase at an optimal pH and decrease at pH levels that are too high or too low.","Clearly states a testable hypothesis that links changes in pH to the rate of catalase activity, predicts an optimal pH range, and specifies that activity will decrease outside this range.","States a testable hypothesis that connects pH changes to catalase activity rate and predicts a change, but may not mention optimal pH or what happens at extremes.",Mentions pH and catalase activity in a hypothesis but lacks clarity about the relationship or only predicts an effect without direction.,Gives an unclear or incomplete hypothesis that does not connect pH to catalase activity or lacks a testable statement.,"If the pH level changes from the optimal pH for catalase, then the rate of enzyme activity will decrease because catalase works best at a specific pH and becomes less effective if the environment is too acidic or too basic.",Advanced,"Your hypothesis is clearly stated and testable, effectively linking changes in pH to the rate of catalase activity. You correctly predict that catalase works best at a specific, optimal pH and that its activity will decrease if the environment becomes too acidic or too basic, which demonstrates a strong understanding of the relationship between pH and enzyme function. This shows you can identify both the optimal range and the expected decrease in activity outside of it. To further strengthen your response, you could specify what you predict the optimal pH range to be, but overall your answer meets the highest expectations for this task."
Predict (applying),"Using the data below, predict Person A’s heart rate after 5 minutes of intense exercise. Show how you used the trend in the data to make your estimate.
Time Exercising (minutes) – Heart Rate (bpm)
1 minute – 95 bpm
3 minutes – 120 bpm
4 minutes – 130 bpm","Based on the data, Person A’s heart rate increases as the time exercising increases. From 1 to 3 minutes, the heart rate goes up by 25 bpm (from 95 to 120 bpm), and from 3 to 4 minutes, it goes up by 10 bpm (from 120 to 130 bpm). The increase is slowing down. If this trend continues, after 5 minutes, the heart rate might increase by a little less than 10 bpm. So, I predict Person A’s heart rate after 5 minutes will be about 138–140 bpm. I used the pattern of smaller increases each minute to make this estimate.","Accurately predicts the heart rate after 5 minutes (within 2 bpm of 140), clearly explains the trend using all data points, and logically shows how the prediction follows the pattern of slowing increases.","Predicts the heart rate after 5 minutes (within 5 bpm of 140), uses most data points to explain the trend, and gives a reasonable explanation for the estimate.",Gives a prediction that is somewhat close (within 10 bpm of 140) but gives a limited or unclear explanation of the trend or only uses one data point.,"Gives a prediction that is far from the expected value, does not use the data trend, or gives little or no explanation of how the estimate was made.","After 1 minute, the heart rate is 95 bpm, then it goes up to 120 bpm at 3 minutes and 130 bpm at 4 minutes. The heart rate seems to be increasing as time goes on. So, after 5 minutes, the heart rate could be around 135 bpm because it looks like it’s going up by about 10 bpm every minute after 3 minutes. This is just an estimate based on the numbers given.",Proficient,"You correctly identified that the heart rate increases over time and used the data to make an estimate for the 5-minute mark, which is reasonably close to the expected value. You noticed the increase between 3 and 4 minutes and applied that pattern to predict the next value, showing some understanding of the trend. However, your explanation could be improved by more clearly describing how the rate of increase is slowing down, as seen in the larger jump from 1 to 3 minutes compared to the smaller jump from 3 to 4 minutes. Including all the data points and explaining how the increases are getting smaller would make your reasoning clearer and strengthen your estimate."
