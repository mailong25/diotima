Recognise (remembering),Name a gland in the body that has both exocrine and endocrine function,The pancreas is a gland in the body that has both exocrine and endocrine functions.,Accurately names the pancreas as a gland with both exocrine and endocrine functions.,"Identifies a gland that has both functions, but may include minor irrelevant information or a slight inaccuracy in naming.",Attempts to name a gland but provides an incorrect answer or names a gland with only one type of function (either exocrine or endocrine).,Does not provide a relevant answer or demonstrates no recognition of a gland with both functions.,The thyroid gland is a gland in the body that has both exocrine and endocrine functions because it releases hormones into the blood and also helps with digestion.,Partial response,"Your answer correctly identifies that a gland can have both exocrine and endocrine functions, demonstrating an understanding of the question's premise. However, the thyroid gland primarily functions as an endocrine gland, releasing hormones directly into the bloodstream, and it does not have an exocrine role in digestion. To improve, focus on identifying the specific gland that performs both exocrine functions, such as producing digestive enzymes, and endocrine functions, like secreting hormones that regulate blood sugar."
Identify (remembering),Name a human cell that is haploid,"A human cell that is haploid is a gamete, such as a sperm cell or an egg cell.","Accurately identifies a specific human haploid cell (e.g., sperm cell, egg cell) or the general term 'gamete'.","Identifies 'gamete' as the type of haploid cell but does not provide a specific example, or provides a correct but less specific example.",Attempts to identify a haploid cell but provides an incorrect or vague answer that shows limited understanding.,Does not identify any human haploid cell or provides a completely incorrect answer.,"A human gamete, like a sperm cell or an egg cell, is haploid because it contains only one set of chromosomes.",Comprehensive response,"Your answer accurately identifies a human gamete, specifically mentioning both sperm and egg cells, as haploid. This demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept and provides the specific examples required."
Recognise (remembering),What is the significance of the internal structure of the mitonchodria,"The internal structure of the mitochondria is significant because it has many folds, called cristae. These folds increase the surface area inside the mitochondria. A larger surface area allows for more chemical reactions to happen, which helps the mitochondria make more energy (ATP) for the cell.","Recognises that the internal folds (cristae) increase surface area, and clearly identifies that this larger surface area allows for more energy production (ATP).","Recognises that the internal folds (cristae) increase surface area, and identifies that this helps with energy production.","Recognises that the mitochondria have internal folds or that they are important for energy production, but does not clearly connect the two ideas or name the folds.",Does not recognise the significance of the internal structure of the mitochondria or provides irrelevant information.,The internal structure of the mitochondria is important because it has folds called cristae that help increase the surface area inside. This lets more reactions happen that make energy for the cell. The structure also helps separate different parts so that the reactions can be more efficient. Mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the cell because of this.,Comprehensive response,"Your response effectively identifies that the internal folds, known as cristae, increase the surface area within the mitochondria, which is crucial for energy production. To further enhance your answer, consider explicitly stating that this increased surface area directly allows for a greater number of chemical reactions to occur, specifically those involved in ATP synthesis, thereby maximizing the cell's energy output."
Classify (understanding),Classify joints into different types,"Joints can be classified into different types based on how much they can move. 

1.  **Immovable Joints (Fibrous Joints):** These joints do not allow any movement. Bones are held together very tightly by strong fibers. An example is the joints between the bones in your skull.
2.  **Slightly Movable Joints (Cartilaginous Joints):** These joints allow a little bit of movement. The bones are connected by cartilage. An example is the joints between your vertebrae (bones in your spine).
3.  **Freely Movable Joints (Synovial Joints):** These joints allow a lot of movement in different directions. They have a special fluid-filled space (synovial cavity) between the bones. Most of the joints in your body are freely movable, like your knee, elbow, and shoulder joints.","Accurately classifies joints into three main types (immovable, slightly movable, freely movable), clearly describes the movement for each type, and provides a correct example for each classification.",Accurately classifies joints into three main types and generally describes the movement for each type. Provides at least two correct examples for the classifications.,Classifies joints into at least two types but may have minor inaccuracies in describing movement or provides only one correct example for the classifications.,"Attempts to classify joints but provides an incomplete classification (e.g., only one type) or includes significant inaccuracies in descriptions or examples.","Joints are the parts where bones meet and they are mainly two types, movable and immovable. Movable joints are like the knee and elbow, and immovable joints are like the skull. Joints help the body to move in different directions.",Limited response,"Your response correctly identifies two types of joints, movable and immovable, and provides accurate examples for both the knee/elbow and the skull. To enhance your answer, consider expanding your classification to include the third main type of joint, which allows for slight movement. Additionally, for each joint type, clearly describe the specific range of motion it permits, as this will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how joints facilitate movement in the body."
Compare (understanding),Compare genetic and epigenetic mechanisms,"Genetic mechanisms involve changes to the actual DNA sequence, like mutations, which are permanent alterations in the building blocks of our genes. These changes are passed down from parent to child. Epigenetic mechanisms, on the other hand, are changes that affect how genes are expressed (turned on or off) without changing the DNA sequence itself. Think of it like adding sticky notes to a cookbook: the recipes (DNA) are still the same, but the notes (epigenetic tags) tell you which recipes to use more often or less often. These changes can be influenced by lifestyle and environment, and while some can be passed on, they are often reversible.","Clearly compares genetic and epigenetic mechanisms by accurately describing both, highlighting their key differences (DNA sequence change vs. gene expression without sequence change), and explaining their heritability and reversibility.","Compares genetic and epigenetic mechanisms by accurately describing both and identifying at least two key differences, such as whether the DNA sequence changes or how they are passed on.","Describes genetic and epigenetic mechanisms separately but provides a limited or unclear comparison, or accurately describes one mechanism but struggles with the other.","Provides a very basic or inaccurate description of genetic and/or epigenetic mechanisms, with little to no clear comparison between them.","Genetic mechanisms involve changes to the actual DNA sequence, like mutations, which can be inherited and directly affect the function of genes. Epigenetic mechanisms, on the other hand, don't change the DNA sequence itself but instead involve modifications like DNA methylation or histone modification that influence how genes are turned on or off. While genetic changes are permanent unless reversed by another mutation, epigenetic changes can be reversible and are often influenced by environmental factors. Both mechanisms play important roles in how traits are expressed and can contribute to diseases, but they operate at different levels of gene regulation.",Comprehensive response,"Your response effectively compares genetic and epigenetic mechanisms by accurately describing both and highlighting key differences. You correctly identify that genetic mechanisms involve changes to the DNA sequence, while epigenetic mechanisms alter gene expression without changing the sequence itself. Furthermore, you accurately distinguish between their permanence and reversibility, noting that genetic changes are generally permanent while epigenetic changes can be reversible and influenced by environmental factors. To elevate your response to a more comprehensive level, consider elaborating on the heritability of epigenetic changes, as some can be passed on, and further explaining how these mechanisms are passed down from parent to child for a complete comparison."
Describe (understanding),Describe the role of tRNA.,"tRNA, which stands for transfer RNA, plays a crucial role in making proteins. Its main job is to carry specific amino acids to the ribosome. The ribosome is like a protein-making factory. Each tRNA molecule has a special three-nucleotide sequence called an anticodon, which matches up with a complementary three-nucleotide sequence (codon) on the mRNA molecule. This matching ensures that the correct amino acid is added in the right order to build the protein chain.","Clearly describes tRNA's role, including its function of carrying amino acids to the ribosome, the concept of anticodons, and their matching with mRNA codons to ensure correct protein synthesis.","Describes tRNA's role in carrying amino acids to the ribosome for protein synthesis and mentions anticodons, but may not fully explain their matching with mRNA codons.","Describes tRNA's general role in protein synthesis or carrying amino acids, but lacks details about the ribosome or the mechanism of matching with mRNA.","Provides a vague or incorrect description of tRNA's role, or demonstrates minimal understanding of its function in protein synthesis.",tRNA is a molecule in cells that helps make proteins. It brings amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis. tRNA matches up with the mRNA to make sure the right amino acids are added.,Competent response,"Your answer correctly identifies that tRNA helps make proteins by bringing amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis and that it matches up with mRNA. To enhance your explanation, consider elaborating on the specific mechanism of this matching, such as mentioning the role of anticodons on tRNA and how they pair with codons on mRNA to ensure the precise order of amino acids in the growing protein chain."
Explain (understanding),Explain what causes pulse and state the average pulse rate in humans,"Pulse is caused by the rhythmic pumping of blood from the heart into the arteries. Each time the heart beats, it pushes a wave of blood through the arteries, causing them to expand and then snap back. This expansion and contraction of the artery walls is what we feel as a pulse. The average pulse rate in humans is typically between 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm) for resting adults.","Clearly explains that pulse is caused by the heart pumping blood into arteries, leading to their expansion and contraction. Accurately states the average pulse rate (60-100 bpm) in humans.","Explains that pulse is caused by the heart pumping blood, mentioning arteries. States the average pulse rate (60-100 bpm) in humans, but the explanation of the cause might lack some detail about artery expansion/contraction.","Provides a basic idea that pulse is related to the heart or blood, but the explanation of the cause is incomplete or unclear. May state a partially correct or vague average pulse rate.",Demonstrates little to no understanding of what causes pulse or provides an incorrect explanation. Fails to state an average pulse rate or provides a significantly incorrect one.,The pulse is caused by blood moving in the veins and it happens when the heart beats. The average pulse rate in humans is about 200 beats per minute.,Limited response,"Your response correctly identifies that the pulse is related to the heart beating. However, to fully explain what causes the pulse, it's important to specify that this action involves the arteries, not the veins, and to describe how the arteries expand and contract with each heartbeat. Additionally, the average pulse rate for humans is typically much lower than what you stated; it generally falls within a range of 60 to 100 beats per minute for resting adults."
Illustrate (understanding),Illustrate the economic importance of bacteria.,"Bacteria are tiny living things that play a big role in many parts of our economy. They are important in several key areas:

1.  **Food Production**: Bacteria are essential for making many foods we eat. For example, they are used to turn milk into cheese, yogurt, and buttermilk. They also help ferment vegetables like cabbage into sauerkraut and cucumbers into pickles. In baking, some bacteria contribute to the sour taste in sourdough bread.
2.  **Medicine and Health**: Bacteria are used to produce important medicines. For instance, genetically engineered bacteria can make insulin, a life-saving medicine for people with diabetes. They also produce antibiotics, which fight harmful bacterial infections, and some vaccines. Probiotic bacteria are found in supplements and foods like yogurt, helping to keep our digestive system healthy.
3.  **Agriculture**: In farming, bacteria are crucial for healthy soil. Some bacteria fix nitrogen from the air into a form plants can use, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers. They also help break down dead plants and animals, returning nutrients to the soil. This makes soil more fertile and helps crops grow better.
4.  **Environmental Cleanup (Bioremediation)**: Bacteria can be used to clean up pollution. Certain types of bacteria can break down harmful substances like oil spills, pesticides, and industrial waste into less toxic forms. This helps protect our environment and makes polluted areas safe again.
5.  **Industrial Uses**: Bacteria are used in various industries. They can produce enzymes used in detergents to clean clothes. They are also used to make biofuels, which are energy sources from living matter, and to extract metals from ores in mining processes, which is more environmentally friendly than traditional methods.","Clearly illustrates the economic importance of bacteria by describing five or more distinct and accurate examples (e.g., food, medicine, agriculture, environmental cleanup, industry) with specific details for each, demonstrating a thorough understanding.","Illustrates the economic importance of bacteria by describing four distinct and accurate examples (e.g., food, medicine, agriculture, environmental cleanup, industry) with some specific details, showing a good understanding.","Illustrates the economic importance of bacteria by describing two or three distinct examples, but with limited specific details or some minor inaccuracies, indicating a basic understanding.","Attempts to illustrate the economic importance of bacteria but provides only one example, or examples are vague, inaccurate, or irrelevant, showing minimal understanding.","Bacteria play a huge role in the economy because they are used in many industries. In agriculture, they help improve soil fertility by fixing nitrogen, which helps crops grow better. In food production, bacteria are essential for making products like yogurt, cheese, and vinegar. They are also important in medicine because they are used to produce antibiotics and vaccines. Additionally, bacteria help break down waste in sewage treatment, making the process more efficient and protecting the environment. Overall, bacteria contribute a lot to food, health, agriculture, and waste management, making them very important economically.",Competent response,"Your response effectively illustrates the economic importance of bacteria by providing four distinct and accurate examples. You clearly explained their role in agriculture, specifically mentioning nitrogen fixation and improved crop growth, and highlighted their use in food production for items like yogurt, cheese, and vinegar. Additionally, you accurately identified their contribution to medicine through antibiotics and vaccines, and their function in waste management, making sewage treatment more efficient. To further enhance your answer and demonstrate a more comprehensive understanding, consider including a fifth distinct example with specific details, such as their role in environmental cleanup beyond waste treatment, or their various industrial applications like enzyme production or biofuel creation."
Apply (applying),"Use the data below to analyze the effect of temperature on enzyme activity. Identify the optimum temperature and support your answer with evidence from the data.
Temperature (°C) – Time to complete reaction (s) – Reaction Rate (1/time)
10 °C – 120 s – 0.008
20 °C – 60 s – 0.017
30 °C – 30 s – 0.033
40 °C – 20 s – 0.050
50 °C – 35 s – 0.029
60 °C – 90 s – 0.011","The data shows that as the temperature increases from 10°C to 40°C, the reaction rate of the enzyme also increases, meaning the reaction completes faster. At 10°C, the reaction rate is 0.008, and it reaches its highest rate of 0.050 at 40°C. After 40°C, as the temperature continues to increase to 50°C and 60°C, the reaction rate starts to decrease significantly (0.029 at 50°C and 0.011 at 60°C). This indicates that the enzyme activity slows down at higher temperatures beyond 40°C.

The optimum temperature for this enzyme is 40°C. This is supported by the data because at 40°C, the enzyme has the highest reaction rate of 0.050, which means the reaction completed in the shortest time (20 seconds). This is the point where the enzyme is most active.","Applies data to clearly analyze the effect of temperature on enzyme activity, accurately identifies the optimum temperature, and provides strong, specific evidence from the data to support the identification and analysis. The explanation of the trend is complete and accurate.","Applies data to analyze the effect of temperature on enzyme activity with minor inaccuracies or less detail. Accurately identifies the optimum temperature and provides some relevant evidence from the data, but the support may be less thorough or specific.","Attempts to apply data to analyze the effect of temperature but with significant gaps or inaccuracies. May correctly identify the optimum temperature but provides weak or incomplete evidence, or identifies the optimum temperature incorrectly but shows some understanding of the data trend.",Does not effectively apply the data to analyze the effect of temperature on enzyme activity. Fails to identify the optimum temperature or provides no relevant evidence from the data to support any claims. Shows minimal understanding of the relationship between temperature and enzyme activity.,"As the temperature goes up, the enzyme activity gets faster because the reaction rate increases. The fastest reaction rate happens at 40°C, which means that is the optimum temperature. After that, the reaction rate starts to go down at 50°C and 60°C. This shows that enzymes work best at 40°C and don’t work as well at higher temperatures.",Competent response,"Your analysis correctly identifies that enzyme activity increases with temperature and accurately pinpoints 40°C as the optimum temperature, noting that the reaction rate is highest at this point. You also correctly observe that the reaction rate decreases at temperatures beyond 40°C. To strengthen your response, consider incorporating more specific data points from the table to support your claims about the increasing and decreasing reaction rates, which would provide more thorough evidence for your analysis of temperature's effect on enzyme activity."
Measure (applying),"Using the data below, calculate the percentage increase in heart rate from resting to post-exercise for each person.
Person A: Resting HR = 68 bpm, Post-Exercise HR = 110 bpm
Person B: Resting HR = 72 bpm, Post-Exercise HR = 130 bpm
Person C: Resting HR = 75 bpm, Post-Exercise HR = 140 bpm","To calculate the percentage increase in heart rate, use the formula: `((Post-Exercise HR - Resting HR) / Resting HR) * 100%`.

**Person A:**
1. Calculate the increase: 110 bpm - 68 bpm = 42 bpm
2. Divide by resting HR: 42 / 68 ≈ 0.6176
3. Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 0.6176 * 100 = 61.76%
   *The percentage increase for Person A is approximately 61.76%.*

**Person B:**
1. Calculate the increase: 130 bpm - 72 bpm = 58 bpm
2. Divide by resting HR: 58 / 72 ≈ 0.8056
3. Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 0.8056 * 100 = 80.56%
   *The percentage increase for Person B is approximately 80.56%.*

**Person C:**
1. Calculate the increase: 140 bpm - 75 bpm = 65 bpm
2. Divide by resting HR: 65 / 75 ≈ 0.8667
3. Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 0.8667 * 100 = 86.67%
   *The percentage increase for Person C is approximately 86.67%.*",Applies the correct formula to accurately calculate the percentage increase for all three individuals. Clearly shows all steps of the calculation for each person and provides correct final answers with appropriate units.,"Applies the correct formula and calculates the percentage increase for at least two of the three individuals correctly. Shows most steps of the calculation, but may have minor errors in one calculation or slight rounding inaccuracies.",Applies the correct formula for at least one individual or attempts to apply it for multiple individuals but makes significant errors in calculation or formula application. May show incomplete steps or incorrect final answers for most cases.,Does not apply the correct formula or shows minimal understanding of how to calculate percentage increase. Calculations are largely incorrect or missing for all individuals.,"To find the percentage increase, just subtract the resting heart rate from the post-exercise one and that’s the answer. So for Person A it’s 110 minus 68 which is 42 percent. For Person B it’s 130 minus 72, so 58 percent. For Person C it’s 140 minus 75 which is 65 percent increase.",Limited response,"Your response correctly identifies the difference between the post-exercise and resting heart rates for each person. However, to accurately calculate the percentage increase, it is essential to apply the full formula, which involves dividing this difference by the original resting heart rate and then multiplying by 100. Your current approach only calculates the absolute increase in heartbeats per minute and incorrectly labels this as a percentage, indicating a minimal understanding of how to determine percentage increase. To improve, ensure you show all steps of the calculation, including the division and multiplication, to arrive at the correct percentage for each individual."
Pose (applying),Pose a hypothesis to test how pH affects the rate of enzyme activity in catalase,"If the pH level changes from the optimal pH for catalase, then the rate of enzyme activity will decrease, because extreme pH levels can change the shape of the enzyme's active site, making it less effective at breaking down hydrogen peroxide.","Poses a clear, testable hypothesis that includes the independent variable (pH), dependent variable (rate of enzyme activity), and a logical scientific explanation for the predicted relationship, demonstrating a strong understanding of enzyme function.","Poses a clear, testable hypothesis that includes the independent variable (pH) and dependent variable (rate of enzyme activity), with a reasonable attempt at a scientific explanation, though it may lack some detail or precision.","Poses a hypothesis that identifies the independent variable (pH) and dependent variable (rate of enzyme activity) but it may be vague, not fully testable, or lacks a scientific explanation for the predicted outcome.","Attempts to pose a hypothesis but fails to clearly identify both the independent and dependent variables, or the statement is not testable or lacks any scientific reasoning.","If the pH level changes from the optimal pH for catalase, then the rate of enzyme activity will decrease because catalase works best at a specific pH and becomes less effective if the environment is too acidic or too basic.",Comprehensive response,"Your hypothesis clearly identifies both pH as the independent variable and the rate of enzyme activity as the dependent variable, and it accurately predicts that activity will decrease if the pH deviates from the optimum. You also provide a scientific explanation for this predicted relationship by stating that catalase works best at a specific pH and becomes less effective in overly acidic or basic environments. To further strengthen your explanation and align more closely with a comprehensive understanding of enzyme function, consider elaborating on *why* extreme pH levels cause the enzyme to become less effective, specifically mentioning how it affects the enzyme's structure or active site."
Predict (applying),"Using the data below, predict Person A’s heart rate after 5 minutes of intense exercise. Show how you used the trend in the data to make your estimate.
Time Exercising (minutes) – Heart Rate (bpm)
1 minute – 95 bpm
3 minutes – 120 bpm
4 minutes – 130 bpm","To predict Person A’s heart rate after 5 minutes, we look at the trend in the data. As the time exercising increases, the heart rate also increases.

Let's find the increase in heart rate per minute:
*   From 1 minute (95 bpm) to 3 minutes (120 bpm): The time increased by 2 minutes (3-1) and heart rate increased by 25 bpm (120-95). So, the average increase is 12.5 bpm per minute (25 bpm / 2 minutes).
*   From 3 minutes (120 bpm) to 4 minutes (130 bpm): The time increased by 1 minute (4-3) and heart rate increased by 10 bpm (130-120). So, the increase is 10 bpm per minute.

The trend shows a consistent increase, but the rate of increase might be slowing down slightly. A reasonable approach is to continue the trend from the last known data point (4 minutes).

If we use the trend from 3 to 4 minutes (an increase of 10 bpm per minute):
Heart rate at 4 minutes = 130 bpm
Predicted increase for the next minute (from 4 to 5 minutes) = 10 bpm
Predicted heart rate at 5 minutes = 130 bpm + 10 bpm = 140 bpm.

So, Person A’s heart rate after 5 minutes of intense exercise is predicted to be around 140 bpm, following the observed trend of increasing heart rate with exercise time.",Accurately predicts the heart rate by identifying a clear trend from the data and precisely applies a logical method to calculate the estimate. Clearly shows all steps and reasoning for the prediction.,"Predicts the heart rate by identifying a trend in the data and applies a method to estimate, but the calculation might have minor inaccuracies or the explanation of the trend application is less detailed. Shows most steps for the prediction.","Attempts to predict the heart rate but identifies an unclear or inconsistent trend, leading to a less accurate estimate. The method applied is partially correct, or the steps shown are incomplete.","Provides a prediction without clearly identifying a trend or applying a logical method from the given data. The explanation is missing or incorrect, and the steps are not shown.","After 1 minute, the heart rate is 95 bpm, then it goes up to 120 bpm at 3 minutes and 130 bpm at 4 minutes. The heart rate seems to be increasing as time goes on. So, after 5 minutes, the heart rate could be around 135 bpm because it looks like it’s going up by about 10 bpm every minute after 3 minutes. This is just an estimate based on the numbers given.",Competent response,"Your response accurately identifies the general trend that heart rate increases with exercise time and uses this observation to make a reasonable prediction for the heart rate at 5 minutes. You correctly note the approximate increase of 10 bpm per minute after the 3-minute mark, which is a logical step in applying the data trend. To further strengthen your answer, consider explicitly showing the calculation steps you used to arrive at your 135 bpm estimate, as this would provide a more detailed explanation of how you applied the trend from the given data."
