    You are evaluating a candidate response to the following task.

    --- Task Prompt ---
    {task_prompt}

    --- Candidate Response ---
    {task_answer}

    First, provide a reasoning about whether the candidate response adequately addresses the task.

    Then, in the final decision, reply:
    - 'Accept' if the candidate correctly and sufficiently answers the task
    - 'Reject' if the candidate fails or is insufficient

    Return your answer only in the following format:
    Reasoning: <your_reasoning>
    Final decision: <decision>

  input_variables:
    - task_prompt
    - task_answer

rubric_evaluation:
  template: |
    You are an evaluator comparing two rubric descriptions.

    Your task:
    - Assess how closely Rubric Description #2 aligns in meaning and scope with Rubric Description #1, for the given question and rubric level.
    - Consider the intent, criteria, and phrasing of each rubric description.

    Context:
    Question: {question}
    Rubric level: {rubric_level}

    Rubric Description #1:
    {rubric1}

    Rubric Description #2:
    {rubric2}

    Evaluation scale (1–5):
    1 = Not aligned — completely different meaning or scope  
    2 = Weakly aligned — partial overlap, major differences  
    3 = Moderately aligned — similar core idea, but notable differences  
    4 = Strongly aligned — mostly equivalent with minor phrasing or focus differences  
    5 = Perfectly aligned — identical meaning and scope

    Instructions:
    - Explain your reasoning in 2–3 sentences, highlighting key similarities or differences.
    - Then provide your numeric score on the final line.

    Output format (use exactly this format):
    Reasoning: <your_reasoning>
    Final score: <score>

  input_variables:
    - rubric1
    - rubric2
    - question
    - rubric_level
