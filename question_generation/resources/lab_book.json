It is presented here with modifications, including updates to align with the 2019 Course and Exam Description for AP Biology. These resources are available to all verified instructors free of charge at the following hyperlink: https://openstax.org/details/books/biology-ap-courses?Instructor%20resources.  \n\nInquiry-based learning involves challenging yourself to learn through self-discovery. Instead of simply presenting you with facts to memorize, this manual encourages you to ask questions about the material that you will then answer through your own exploration. By creating your own hypotheses and then planning and carrying out your own experiments on a variety of topics in the lab manual, you will hopefully learn biology by satisfying your own curiosity.  \n\nIn this AP lab manual, the inquiry-based structure includes the following components:  \n\n1. Pre-assessment section: This section contains a list of questions that you should answer before starting each activity. These are meant to get you thinking about the main concepts of each lab. The pre-assessment questions are designed to connect the concepts in each lab to your experiences in daily life. Whether you realize it or not, you observe biology constantly in the world around you. Therefore, you are likely familiar with more biology topics than you realize! The pre-assessment questions are meant to tap into the biology knowledge you already have and apply it to what you will learn in each lab.  \n\n2. Structured Inquiry: In this section, you will be introduced to an experimental system by doing a well-laid out experiment with detailed steps. This section is meant to guide you in using the equipment in a \u201csafer\u201d activity before planning and performing an entire experiment. However, you will still be posing questions, predictions, and hypotheses in the structured inquiry. You will also critically think about how to achieve the most accurate and reliable results during the structured inquiry in preparation for creating your own experiments in the guided inquiry.  \n\n3. Guided Inquiry: In the guided inquiry, you will use the familiarity you gained during the structured inquiry to perform your own self-investigation. The experimental setup of the guided inquiries is often identical to that used in the structured inquiry. Therefore, you will be working with equipment and methods that you have already tried in the structured inquiry. This time, you will pick a variable to study, create a hypothesis, and fully design an experiment to test your hypothesis. You will determine which equipment and methods you should use to collect accurate and precise data.  \n\nComponents of Structured and Guided Inquiry Sections  \nTo ensure that an inquiry-based approach is implemented in each activity, both the structured and guided inquiries also contain each of the following steps at least once:  \n\nHypothesize/Predict: This is where you will be creating hypotheses, which are questions or predictions about what will happen during an experiment. Be sure that your hypotheses are clear, specific, and testable.  \n\nGood hypothesis: The volume of water in a container will be higher when a 2-gram mass is added compared to when a 1-gram mass is added.  \n\nPoor hypothesis: The volume of water in this experiment will increase as larger objects are added.  \n\nGood hypothesis: The speed of a vehicle traveling down the 30\u1d52 ramp will be lower than the speed of the vehicle traveling down the 60\u1d52 ramp.  \n\nPoor hypothesis: The vehicle will travel fast down the ramp with the greater amount of slant.  \n\nStudent-led Planning: Each inquiry contains at least one step where you and your lab partners will plan how to properly conduct your experiment. During the Structured Inquiry, you will generally plan proper techniques for getting the best results possible using the available equipment and described methods. As with many things in life, two or more heads are often better than one, and you and your group members should come to a consensus on a plan before proceeding. This will lay the groundwork for the Guided Inquiry; you and your group will need to plan an entire experiment in this step.  \n\nCritical Analysis: This step typically occurs near the end of each inquiry. Here you will critically analyze your results, judge their validity, and explain why your hypotheses were supported or not supported by your results. You will also suggest ways that your experimental methods could have been improved to get more accurate or precise data as well as determine new questions to ask related to your results.  \n\nA Note About Your Notebook  \nAs part of the challenge of taking an AP course, this lab manual does not contain data tables where you record your findings. Therefore, you will be required to design your own tables, answer assessments, and do any other note-taking in a separate notebook. You should use the same notebook for biology lab throughout the year. This will allow you to easily refer back to previous labs when you need to reference earlier content. Do not put non-biology content in your biology notebook, as your teacher may collect and grade your notebook throughout the year.  \n\nComponents of a Lab  \n\nMain introduction:  \nEach lab contains an introductory section under the title. This introduces the \u201cbig picture\u201d concepts of the lab as well as how they connect to everyday life. They will also introduce the pioneering physicists and experiments that led to our current knowledge of each lab topic. Relevant equations that you will use in the labs are also introduced here, including definitions of their variables. Many of the labs involve measuring the value of these variables so that you can later perform your own calculations.  \n\nIn this lab you will learn:  \nThis section presents learning objectives for the lab. These are the \u201ctake away points\u201d that you should be able to explain or perform after doing the activities.  \n\nSafety precautions:  \nThese bullet points list important safety issues that will prevent injury to yourself or your classmates during the lab activities. Each activity has its own safety precautions section.  \n\nFor this activity you will need section:  \nThis section lists all of the materials needed for each activity.  \n\nActivity introduction:  \nThese are short introductions relevant to specific activities. The activity introductions may contain formulas, equations, or other background information needed to successfully carry out and understand the activities.  \n\nCollege Board\u00ae (CB) Standard Alignment:  \nCollege Board\u00ae standards are summarized in a table format at the beginning of each lab. The College Board\u2019s\u00ae AP Biology Course and Exam Description was used to provide this information. In addition, standards tags are found on the assessments, allowing you to quickly identify which standard is addressed by each question."

        "text": "Lab 2: Introduction to Microscopy\n\nA microscope magnifies the image of an object through a series of lenses. The condenser lens focuses the light from the microscope\u2019s lamp onto the specimen. The light then passes through the object and is refracted by the objective lens. The objective lens is the more powerful lens of a microscope and is closest to the object. The light then travels to the ocular lens, which focuses the image onto the user\u2019s eye. Usually, the power of the ocular lens is fixed for a given microscope.\n\nDifferent microscopes can magnify objects hundreds, thousands, or even millions of times. Magnification refers to how much larger the image is compared to the original object. As magnification increases, the image becomes larger. The total magnification is the power of the objective multiplied by the power of the ocular lenses. Resolution refers to the ability of a microscope to distinguish two points on the image. As resolution increases, objects that are closer together appear as separate points. Contrast refers to the ability of a microscope to distinguish an object from its background. The higher the contrast, the greater the difference in intensity between an object and the background.\n\nSafety Precautions  \n- Handle microscopes and lenses with care.  \n- Do not drop or crush slides. Alert your teacher immediately to any broken glass so it can be properly disposed.\n\nStructured Inquiry  \nWhen moving a microscope, grasp the neck firmly with one hand and place your other hand under the microscope\u2019s base. Do not bang the microscope on the desk. Once you have set down your microscope, turn the revolving nosepiece so that the lowest power objective is pointed at the stage.\n\nThroughout this lab, handle slides by their edges and do not touch the specimen area to avoid smudges. Place the slide with the letter e on the stage. Make sure it is oriented so that you can read the letter e correctly with the naked eye while standing at the microscope.\n\nYou will now observe the slide containing the letter e. Center the specimen on the stage and look through the ocular lens. Adjust the coarse and fine focus knobs until the letter comes into focus. Be careful while focusing so that the slide does not touch the lenses.\n\nMicroscope Care and Maintenance: When you are finished using a microscope, make sure the lowest power objective is in place and take the slide off the stage. Use only lens paper to wipe the lenses if they are dirty. Support the microscope by the base when carrying it.\n\nGuided Inquiry  \nFind the light source on the microscope. Turn on the light source and trace the path of light from the source to the ocular lens.\n\nDifferent microscopes may be designed differently, such as an inverted microscope where the objective lens is below the sample instead of above it, to observe cells in deep dishes.\n\nThe total magnification of a microscope is calculated by multiplying the power of the objective lens by the power of the ocular lens.\n\nActivity 2: The Field of View\n\nWhen you first place a specimen on the microscope\u2019s stage, the image you see in the ocular lens will likely appear blurry. This is because light rays from the object are not reaching your eye at the same time. Focusing is used to improve the image. Focusing moves the stage up and down, which changes the point at which the light rays from the object converge. When the stage is at a position so that the light rays exactly converge on the retina of your eye, the image will appear sharp and clear.\n\nThe proper distance between the specimen and the objective lens is called the working distance.\n\nThe field of view refers to the portion of the object that is seen through the ocular lenses.\n\nSafety Precautions  \n- Handle microscopes and lenses with care.  \n- Do not drop or crush slides.\n\nStructured Inquiry  \nTurn the revolving nosepiece of the microscope so that the lowest power objective is pointed at the stage.\n\nPlace the slide with the letter e on the stage. Make sure it is oriented so that you can read the letter e correctly with the naked eye while standing at the microscope.\n\nGuided Inquiry  \nThe size of the field of view changes as the magnification changes. Measurements of the field of view can be made using a stage micrometer or a slide with an attached ruler.\n\nActivity 3: Depth of Field and Wet Mount of Specimens\n\nAs you work with a microscope, you will notice that even when an object is in focus, you can continue to adjust the focus and see new things in the lenses. This is because most specimens are very thick. As you move up and down with the stage, different planes of the object come into focus.\n\nThe depth of field refers to how thick each plane is. It tells you how much of a specimen is in focus at any given time.\n\nAlthough a higher depth of field allows you to see more objects, most scientists try to make the depth of field as narrow as possible. This prevents light from other focal planes from interfering with the observations..\nThe specimens you use on your microscope can either be wet-mounted or dry-mounted. A wet-mount refers to living tissues that are placed on a slide with an aqueous solution to keep them wet. Usually, a coverslip is placed on top of the specimen to flatten the specimen onto the slide. A dry-mount refers to preserved tissue that has been fixed and stained on a slide. This technique allows you to preserve specimens for a long time, and it also allows you to add chemicals to increase the contrast of a specimen from its background.\n\nSafety Precautions  \nHandle glass slides with care.  \nDispose of specimens as necessary.  \nDispose of coverslips in a broken-glass container.\n\nBefore the cell theory was developed, two previous theories were prevalent at different historical theories:  \na. The Miasma Theory, where diseases were thought to be spread by miasma, a poisonous, foul-smelling vapor that can travel through the air.  \nb. The Theory of Spontaneous Generation, where living things could be generated from non-living matter, such as how maggots seem to appear spontaneously on meat left in the open."

The Theory of Spontaneous Generation, where living things could be generated from non-living matter, such as how maggots seem to appear spontaneously on meat left in the open.  \n\nThe three major macromolecules that make up a bulk of our foods are carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins.  \nCarbohydrates and proteins often consist of many smaller structural units, called monomers, linked together into long chains, called polymers.  \n\nA chemical indicator called Benedict\u2019s solution turns from blue to brick red in the presence of certain monosaccharides.  \n\nA chemical mixture containing copper sulfate undergoes a color change when it binds to the nitrogen atoms in certain macromolecules.  \n\nBefore investigating the presence of these macromolecules in food, it is important to first perform what is called a positive control and negative control standards test for each macromolecule. Your positive control samples will contain the macromolecules glucose, starch, egg white protein, and vegetable oil. These samples will provide you with a reference for identifying each of the representative macromolecules in your food samples. Your negative control will be distilled water, which should provide results for the absence of the macromolecule in your food sample.  \n\nTo begin your investigation, you will conduct a sequence of four tests for investigating carbohydrates. In test 1, you will use a procedure called the Benedict\u2019s test to confirm the presence of glucose, which is a monosaccharide found in many types of food. For test 2, you will use a solution of iodine to determine whether the polysaccharide starch is present in a solution. For test 3, you will use the Biuret test to identify if a solution contains protein. Then, in test 4, lipids will be detected using a very simple test called the paper spot test.  \n\nSafety Precautions  \n- Safety goggles must be used throughout the duration of the laboratory activity.  \n- It is highly recommended that you wear rubber gloves and a lab apron when handling any of the chemicals.  \n- Immediately inform your teacher of spills containing the test solutions. The acids and bases in the solutions can harm your skin.  \n- Immediately inform your teacher of any broken glassware, as it could cause injuries.  \n- Clean up any spilled water or other fluids to prevent other people from slipping.  \n- Immediately wash your hands if they directly come in contact with the test solutions. It is important to wash your hands after the laboratory activity to avoid any possible contamination of other surfaces with chemical residues that might be on your hands.  \n\nChemicals  \n- Distilled water  \n- Benedict\u2019s solution  \n- 1 percent copper sulfate solution or Biuret reagent  \n- 10 percent sodium hydroxide  \n- Lugol\u2019s solution or iodine-potassium iodide solution  \n- 5 percent glucose solution  \n- 2 percent starch solution  \n- 1 percent albumin solution or raw liquid egg white  \n- Vegetable oil  \n\nCalibrating the test tubes:  \nBefore beginning this activity, it is important to calibrate your test tubes to ensure accurate and consistent test results. To do this, you will need the test tube rack, seven test tubes, the 10 ml graduated cylinder, and a marker or grease pencil. For this laboratory activity, it is best to calibrate your test tubes in 1 ml increments. The maximum volume you will measure is 5 ml.  \n\nCarbohydrates:  \nTest tube number | Test solution  \n1 | Distilled water  \n2 | Glucose test solution  \n3 | Distilled water  \n4 | Starch test solution  \n\nProteins:  \nTest tube number | Test solution  \n1 | Distilled water  \n2 | Dilute protein solution  \n3 | Concentrated protein solution.\nFigure 3.3: Biuret results.\n\nLipids:  \nAs discussed in the introduction, you will use a strip of brown paper to indicate the presence of lipids in a solution.\n\nTest tube number  \n1  \n2  \n3  \n\nTest solution  \nDistilled water  \nWater mixed with vegetable oil  \nVegetable oil  \n\nTable 3.3\n\nFigure 3.4: Labeled section of brown paper bag for lipid test.\n\nFigure 3.5: Paper spot test for lipids.\n\nFigure 3.6: Benedict\u2019s test results for glucose concentration.\n\nStarch and glycogen are both composed of 1,4 bonded glucose polymers.\n\nGlycoproteins are protein macromolecules that have carbohydrate groups attached to a polypeptide chain."

This name is now considered inaccurate because algae are eukaryotes. Cyanobacteria, like those shown in Figure 4.1, are photoautotrophs\u2014organisms that carry out photosynthesis by using light energy, water, and carbon dioxide from the air and converting to sugars, and providing oxygen to the atmosphere as a waste product. Cyanobacteria contain pigments capable of capturing light energy but do not contain chloroplasts. Cyanobacteria are single-celled organisms, but some can form colonies with differentiated cell types. For example, some species can form specialized cells called heterocysts\u2014structures containing enzymes which can take atmospheric nitrogen (nitrogen fixation) from the air and convert into usable molecules for DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. Nitrogen fixation involves converting nitrogen gas (N2) from the atmosphere to ammonia (NH3). Ammonia is a form of nitrogen that can be used to build other molecules, including DNA, RNA, and proteins. Oxygen, a waste product of photosynthesis, interferes with a key enzyme in nitrogen fixation. Thus, only a few cells in a colony (about 1 in 10) become heterocysts. Resources, such as ammonia and sugars from photosynthesis, are then shared between cells. These cells range from 1\u201340 micrometers in size. Not all bacteria can carry out photosynthesis there are many species of heterotrophic bacteria living virtually everywhere on Earth. These cells are much smaller ranging from 0.5\u20138 micrometers. Eukaryotic cells have many more features and organelles and range in size from 10\u2013500 micrometers.\n\nFigure 4.1: Cyanobacteria Nostoc with larger heterocysts.\n\nStructured Inquiry  \nStep 1: Estimate the size of the field of view at all the magnifications of your microscope by placing a clear millimeter ruler on the stage of the microscope. This will allow you to estimate the sizes of cells. Convert your millimeter estimates to micrometers for this activity.\n\nFigure 4.2: Example of a millimeter ruler taped to a microscope slide.\n\nStep 3: In your notebook, create a detailed drawing, with a sharp pencil, of the structure of the cyanobacterium. An example of a detailed drawing is seen in Figure 4.3. Record the estimated size of the cells at the magnification used. Use color in your drawings if appropriate. Identify the colors used and label any obvious structures. Note the shapes or organization of the cells.\n\nFigure 4.3: Example of a student drawing including labels and magnification.\n\nAssessments  \nCreate a diagram of a general prokaryotic cell and a general eukaryotic cell. Label the cell structures that differ between the two cell types.\n\nActivity 2: Comparing Plant Cells  \nPlant cells are eukaryotic; they have subcellular organelles. Like the bacteria, they have a cell wall to help keep the cell rigid\u2014in plants, the cell wall is composed of a complex carbohydrate called cellulose. Plant cells, like that shown in Figure 4.4, also have a nucleus with DNA, a large central vacuole full of water and other important substances for maintaining life such as carbohydrates, non-nutrients, wastes, and help maintain cell pressure.\n\nFigure 4.4: Structures found in a typical plant cell.\n\nGuided Inquiry  \nStep 1: Hypothesize/Predict: What features do you expect to see in the plant cell Elodea and the onion skin under low and high magnification? Draw and label your prediction in your notebook.\n\nStep 2: Student-led Planning: Prepare wet mounts of Elodea and the onion skin. View with water only, and again in iodine solution (biological stain). Record your observations as drawings. Use color if present, label the magnification, and estimate the size of the cells in your notebook.\n\nFor this activity, you will need the following:  \n\u25cf Elodea anacharis, moss or Spirogyra green algae  \n\u25cf Light compound microscope  \n\u25cf Clean microscope slides and cover slips  \n\u25cf Lens paper  \n\u25cf Water and dropper  \n\u25cf Yellow onion  \n\u25cf Forceps  \n\u25cf Iodine solution (optional)\n\nActivity 3: Observe Animal Cells and Identify their Components  \nAnimal cells are eukaryotic and possess subcellular components in common with the plant cells you observed in Activity 2. Organelles that plant and animal cells share in common include the nucleus, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, ribosomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum. These are all participants in protein synthesis. An illustration of an animal cell is shown in Figure 4.5. There are some exceptions to these general components. For example, mature red blood cells (RBC) which have ejected their nuclei to have more room for hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen around the body. One of the easiest eukaryotic cells to obtain in the lab is the squamous epithelial cell (your cheek cells). These cells are arranged in a flat layer and are easy to remove and observe.\n\nFigure 4.5: Diagram of the parts of an animal cell.\nPrepared slide of red blood cells  \nLight compound microscope  \nClean microscope slide, cover slip  \nClean cotton swab  \n0.5\u20131 percent methylene blue solution  \nDropper or pipette  \nSmall squares of paper towels  \n\nFigure 4.6: How to prepare a cheek swab.  \n\nFigure 4.7: How to stain cheek cells with methylene blue dye.  \n\nFigure 4.8: Cheek cells stained with methylene blue dye.  \n\nFigure 4.9: This figure shows three photos of different cell types.

Chloroplasts (\u201cgreen bodies\u201d) are an example of a mature plastid that contain pigments, water insoluble lipid molecules that can be found in membranes and are capable of absorbing light energy. These start the process of photosynthesis, as shown in Figure 5.2. You will examine a few different types of plastids in this lab. The two plastids that are examined in this activity are the chromoplasts and the amyloplasts, shown in Figure 5.3 and Figure 5.4, respectively. Chromoplasts, or colored bodies, are mature plastids that are used primarily for the synthesis of pigments and their storage. Chromoplast pigments are found in many plant parts such as flowers, roots, and aging leaves. The purpose of these plastid pigments is to attract pollinators to the plant and to advertise to different animals that eat the fruit (such as mammals, birds, insects, and reptiles) and then disperse the seeds, generally with a bit of fertilizer. These pigments are also found in root vegetables such as carrots and yams. Amyloplasts, meaning starch bodies, are a type of leucoplast, or white body, that are colorless; these plastids synthesize glucose into starch, store starch, and help the plant detect gravity using statoliths.  \n\nFigure 5.1: Protoplasts are the stem for several other plastids.  \nFigure 5.2: A micrograph of chloroplasts within plant cells  \nFigure 5.3: A micrograph of chromoplasts within plant cells  \nFigure 5.4: A micrograph of amyloplasts within plant cells  \n\nSafety Precautions  \n- Be careful handling glass slides, the edges may be sharp.  \n- Cut away from your body. Sectioning of potato and carrots involves using a single-edged razor blade, use care to avoid cuts.  \n- Observe proper use of the microscope; avoid handling the electric cord with wet hands.  \n- Do not use the coarse adjustment knob of the microscope at higher magnifications.  \n- Inform your teacher immediately of any broken glassware, as it could cause injuries.  \n- Dispose of biological stains according to teacher instructions and local regulations.  \n- Wash your hands with soap and water after handling biological stains.  \n\nFigure 5.5: Process for making a wet mount cell of potato tissue  \n\nActivity 2: Central Vacuole and Anthocyanins  \nPlant cells are eukaryotic; they have subcellular organelles.

Plant cells also have a nucleus with DNA and a large central vacuole (see Figure 5.6) full of water and other important substances (such as carbohydrates, non-nutrients, wastes) for maintaining life and to help maintain cell pressure.  \n\nFigure 5.6: Structures of a generalized plant cell.  \n\nThe second major type of pigment found in plastids is water soluble. These pigment molecules, called flavonoids, are stored in the central vacuole of plants. The specific pigment found in the central vacuole that is examined in this activity is called anthocyanin (meaning flower blue) the addition of a sugar group to its structure makes it water soluble. If cations (positively charged ions or polyatomic ions) are added or removed from the anthocyanin structure the pigment color will change, showing the anthocyanins are sensitive to pH changes. Anthocyanins are found in most plant tissues as well as algae and some bacteria. Anthocyanins are hypothesized to protect plant tissues from harmful UV radiation and are also used as camouflage from herbivores.  \n\nSafety Precautions  \n- Be careful handling glass slides, the edges may be sharp.  \n- Observe proper use of the microscope; avoid handling the electric cord with wet hands.  \n- Do not use the coarse adjustment knob of the microscope at higher magnifications.  \n- Inform your teacher immediately of any broken glassware, as it could cause injuries.  \n- Wear goggles when handling pH solutions.  \n- If any pH solutions get on your hands, flush with water to remove.  \n- Dispose of pH solutions according to teacher instructions and local regulations.  \n- Wash your hands with soap and water after handling pH solutions.  \n\nFigure 5.7: Process for preparing red onion wet mounts.\nAnimal cells are eukaryotic and possess subcellular components in common with plant cells.

        "text": "Diffusion is the movement of molecules from an area where the molecule is highly concentrated to an area of low concentration. The rate of diffusion is dependent upon the temperature of a system, molecular size, and the medium through which diffusion is occurring (i.e., semi-solid, liquid, air).\n\nOsmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane (i.e., cell membrane). Because of osmosis, water will move where water is less concentrated from an area of low solute (high water content) to an area with high solute concentration (low water content). Dialysis tubing is used to model selectively permeable membranes because it will prohibit large molecules from crossing the membrane but will allow small molecules to cross. For example, water and glucose are small molecules that can easily cross the membrane. However, starch (a polymer of glucose), cannot cross due to its large molecular size.\n\nCell surface area and volume can affect the rate of diffusion across a membrane. The surface area-to-volume ratio describes the relationship between the area outside the cell to the volume inside the cell. Smaller cells have higher surface areas compared to larger cells.\n\nFigure 6.1: In diffusion, molecules move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration.\n\nFigure 6.2: Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semipermeable membrane. Water moves from an area of high water and low solute concentration to an area of low water and high solute concentration.

The differences in solute concentration direct the movement of water across the plasma membrane of the cell. This difference between the two solutions (i.e., the cytoplasm and the extracellular fluid) is known as tonicity. Solutions are said to be isotonic if they both have equal concentrations of solute. The extracellular fluid is hypertonic to the intracellular fluid if it has a higher solute concentration. On the other hand, a lower solute concentration in the extracellular fluid compared to the inside of the cell would mean that the outside of the cell is hypotonic to the inside.  \nWe can observe tonicity in Elodea leaves by placing them into different solutions with various solute concentrations.  \n\nA cell membrane is selectively permeable."

One easy way to measure the concentration of a chemical is by using a colored indicator. As an enzymatic reaction proceeds, the color of the solution changes, and can be monitored visually.\n\nIn this lab, you will measure the enzymatic activity of lactase, an enzyme that breaks down lactose, a disaccharide found in milk and other dairy products, into the monosaccharides galactose and glucose (Figure 7.1). While human infants naturally produce lactase, most adults do not, making them lactose intolerant, or unable to produce enough lactase to digest ingested lactose. Interestingly, in the past 10,000 years, several populations of humans have developed lifelong lactase activity. These human populations are often people who raise livestock and drink animal milk. For most individuals who are lactose intolerant, lactase may be purchased in tablet form from pharmacies.\n\nFigure 7.1: The enzyme lactase degrades the disaccharide lactose into the monosaccharides galactose (1) and glucose (2).\n\nGlucose, one of the products of lactose degradation, can be detected visually using glucose detection strips, which can also be purchased from pharmacies. One type of glucose detection strip contains the dye toluidine blue and the enzyme glucose oxidase (Figure 7.2). Glucose oxidase within the strip converts the glucose to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide then interacts with the toluidine blue within the strip, bringing about a color change from blue to green to yellow to brown.\n\nFigure 7.2: Diastix glucose detection strips turn from blue to green to yellow to brown with increasing concentrations of glucose.\n\nSafety Precautions\n\u25cf Measure fluids carefully using graduated cylinders to avoid breakage and spillage.\n\u25cf Inform your teacher immediately of any broken glassware as it could cause injuries.\n\u25cf Clean up any spilled fluids to prevent other people from slipping.\n\nFor this activity, you will need the following:\n\u25cf Graduated cylinder\n\u25cf Beaker\n\u25cf Water\n\u25cf Milk\n\u25cf Lactase (obtained from laboratory supply company)\n\u25cf Stirring rod\n\u25cf Test tubes\n\u25cf Glucose (powdered)\n\u25cf Balance\n\u25cf Labeling pencil\n\u25cf Glucose test strips\n\u25cf Graph paper\n\u25cf Timer\n\nActivity 2: The Effects of Temperature and pH on Enzymatic Activity\n\nWhat types of environmental factors may affect enzymatic activity? Why? Several factors known to affect enzymatic activity are temperature, pH, and substrate concentration. In a typical chemical reaction, increasing temperature causes the substrates to become more energetic and hence more likely to bump into each other in solution. However, changes in temperature can cause an enzyme to denature, which changes the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme molecule. In addition, cellular enzymes each work within a certain pH range because the side chains within their active sites are optimized for efficient catalysis and are thus quite sensitive to changes in pH. Different enzymes may have different pH ranges and pH optima, conditions under which they work maximally; while many enzymes work best around a neutral pH, some are adapted to an acidic pH, while others are adapted to a basic pH.\n\nSafety Precautions\n\u25cf Measure fluids carefully using graduated cylinders to avoid breakage and spillage.\n\u25cf Be careful not to touch solutions of concentrated acids and bases directly.\n\u25cf Take precautions when using a hot plate and touching hot glassware.\n\u25cf Inform your teacher immediately of any broken glassware as it could cause injuries.\n\u25cf Clean up any spilled fluids to prevent other people from slipping.\n\nFor this activity, you will need the following:\n\u25cf Graduated cylinder\n\u25cf Beaker\n\u25cf Water\n\u25cf Buffer solutions of pH 3.0, pH 4.0, pH 5.0, pH 6.0, pH 7.0, pH 8.0, and pH 9.0\n\u25cf Milk\n\u25cf Lactase (obtained from laboratory supply company)\n\u25cf Test tubes\n\u25cf Stirring rod\n\u25cf Labeling pencil\n\u25cf Hot plate\n\u25cf Ice bath\n\nStructured Inquiry: Temperature\n\nStep 1: Prepare a large beaker of boiling tap water on a hot plate. Prepare five identical test tubes, each containing 2 mL of milk. Label five test tubes accordingly with each of the following temperatures: 0\u00b0C (ice bath), 4\u00b0C (refrigerator), room temperature, 37\u00b0C, and 100\u00b0C (boiling temperature). Place one tube of milk at each of the five temperatures. Create a data table to enter your results for each of these test tubes over time. Measure the room temperature using a thermometer..\nActivity 3: Substrate Specificity of the Enzyme Lactase  \nAn enzyme\u2019s active site contains side chains of the amino acids that can only bind to certain molecules. For example, if the active site is largely positively charged, then negatively charged substrates will be attracted. Additionally, the three-dimensional shape of the active site within the enzyme is key in determining which substrates will fit into the active site (Figure 7.3). What does this suggest about how specific enzymes are to their substrates?  \nFigure 7.3: The three-dimensional shape of the active site is also important in determining which substrates will bind to the active site.\n\nSafety Precautions  \nMeasure fluids carefully using graduated cylinders to avoid breakage and spillage.  \nInform your teacher immediately of any broken glassware as it could cause injuries.  \nClean up any spilled fluids to prevent other people from slipping.\n\nFor this activity, you will need the following:  \nGraduated cylinder  \nBeaker  \nWater  \n20 mg/mL lactose solution  \n20 mg/mL sucrose solution  \nVarious foods for testing for presence of lactose, including both dairy products and those marketed as lactose-free  \nLactase (obtained from laboratory supply company)  \nTest tubes  \nStirring rod  \nTimer  \nLabeling pencil  \nGlucose test strips  \nGraph paper\n\nStructured Inquiry: pH  \nStep 1: Prepare three test tubes, each containing 2 mL of milk and label the three tubes as follows: 4.0 (acidic), 7.0 (neutral), and 9.0 (basic).

Janus Green B is a stain that appears blue-green when oxidized (that is, when it loses electrons) and is colorless or light pink when reduced (when it gains electrons).\n\nSafety Precautions  \n\u25cf Use single edge razor blade with caution. Do not leave blades exposed on the bench. When you are finished using the razor blade, dispose of it as instructed by your teacher.  \n\u25cf Dispose of coverslips in a broken glass container.  \n\u25cf Be careful handling glass slides, the edges may be sharp.  \n\u25cf If using cheek cells, dispose of flat toothpicks and slides in a jar containing 10 percent bleach.  \n\u25cf Handle dyes with care and be careful not to ingest.  \n\u25cf Inform your teacher immediately of any broken glassware as it could cause injuries.  \n\u25cf Clean up any spilled fluids to prevent other people from slipping.  \n\u25cf Wash your hands with soap and water after completion of the activity.\n\nFor this activity, you will need the following:  \n\u25cf Onion; alternatively slices of celery branch or cheek epithelial cells may be used  \n\u25cf Toothpicks and 10 percent bleach container if using epithelial cells  \n\u25cf Forceps  \n\u25cf Water and dropper  \n\u25cf 0.001 percent solution of Janus Green B  \n\u25cf Absorbent paper such as a paper towel or filter paper  \n\u25cf Microscope  \n\u25cf Slides and coverslips  \n\u25cf Mounting fluid to be chosen by students (7 percent sucrose, 0.9 percent salt, vinegar, ammonia)\n\nStructured Inquiry  \nStep 1: Preparation and observation of wet mount:  \nSlice a layer from an onion with the single edge razor blade and grab the edge of the layer with the forceps peeling back a thin transparent layer of epidermal tissue. The thickness of the layer is one or a few cells which will allow you to visualize clearly the inside of the cells.  \nAdd a drop of water and place a cover slip over the onion slice; do not remove air bubbles if they form.\n\nJanus Green B is an indicator of the redox state. Knowing that it appears blue/green in its oxidized state, and loses its color when it is reduced, allows you to predict which organelle will show a progressive change in color because it is the active site of oxidation-reduction.\n\nStain with Janus Green B by using the wicking method. Place a piece of filter paper or tissue on one side of the cover slip. Add one or two drops of Janus Green on the opposite side of the coverslip close to the edge. The stain solution will flow in by capillary action.\n\nMonitor the changes in stain appearance for five to 10 minutes, taking turns observing the slide.\n\nDraw and label all the structures that you can identify. Add a title and the final magnification to all the drawings. Draw only what you observe.\n\nCompare the effect of different mounting solutions to distilled water. Observe if there is a change in the color of mitochondria and if it changes over time.\n\nGuided Inquiry  \nJanus Green B is a vital stain and an indicator of redox state. It appears blue/green in its oxidized state and loses its color when it is reduced. This allows prediction of which organelle will show a progressive change in color because it is the active site of oxidation-reduction and which organelle will appear colorless.\n\nActivity 2: Measurement of Respiration and Effect of Temperature on Respiration Rate  \nIn respiration, oxygen is consumed and CO2 is released. In this experiment, the disappearance of oxygen will be measured. A respirometer consists of an enclosed chamber in which the studied organism is placed and a graduated pipette with which changes in the gas volumes are measured. The CO2 gas which forms will be removed by adding Ca(OH)2 that reacts with carbon dioxide to form the insoluble salt CaCO3 (calcium carbonate).\n\nThe ideal gas law equation is stated as:  \nP represents the atmospheric pressure in mmHg, V is the volume of the gas in liters, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin. In the respirometer, pressure remains constant as the gas produced displaces water in the tube. The respirometers are set up in a water bath to minimize fluctuations in temperature..\nIn a seed, like the yellow peas shown in Figure 8.2, a tough coat protects the plant embryo. Nutrients in the form of starch and lipids surround the embryo and support its germination, or growth from seed, until the appearance of photosynthetic structures. Seeds are normally dormant, that is metabolically inactive, until the environmental conditions helpful for growth are available. In order to bring the seeds to an active state, (out of dormancy), the seeds you will use were soaked in water via a process called imbibition, for 6 to 8 days.\n\nFigure 8.2: Dried yellow peas are the seeds of a variety of the plant Pisum sativum and are considered a staple food. They contain yellow cotyledons and a large reserve of starch.\n\nCellular respiration involves three major sequential stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Oxygen serves as a terminal electron acceptor. Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm whereas mitochondria are the site of the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain.\n\nAll the steps of respiration are mediated by enzymes, biological catalysts\u2014mainly proteins\u2014that lower the activation energy, the energy required to be available in a system before a chemical reaction can take place. Enzymes are not used up by the reactions they catalyzed. The process of respiration responds to the same environmental factors that affect the activity of enzymes.\n\nSafety Precautions  \n- Handle test tubes or glass containers with care; insert the plug by holding the container in a paper towel.  \n- Use plastic pipettes rather than glass pipettes.  \n- Wear goggles or safety glasses.  \n- Wear gloves when working with KOH or lime [Ca(OH)2] that are corrosive chemical compounds.  \n- Use care while handling hot water. Wear mitts and do not leave boiling water or a hot plate unattended.  \n- Protect your clothes with an apron.  \n- Inform your teacher immediately of any broken glassware as it could cause injuries.  \n- Clean up any spilled fluids to prevent other people from slipping.  \n- Wash your hands with soap and water after completion of the activity.\n\nFigure 8.3: Assembled respirometer.  \na. In a wide test tube (or bottle), drop a pad of absorbent cotton. Pack down the cotton with a stirring rod. Add lime water Ca(OH)2, being careful not to oversaturate the pad or drip the lime water on the side of the tube.  \nb. Insert a thin layer of non absorbent cotton, pushing down with the glass rod. The cotton protects the seeds from lime water; however, if it is too thick, it will interfere with the diffusion of CO2.  \nc. Plug the test tube with a bored rubber stopper. Add a drop of colored water in a 1-ml graduated pipette and insert the pipette in the hole of the stopper. Adjust the position of the drop by inserting a syringe in the stopper until you can easily read the position of the dye. (The syringe is not shown in Figure 8.3.) Rub some petroleum jelly where the pipette comes into contact with the rubber stopper. The respirometer must be water tight to yield reliable results. It is also possible to wrap the openings with stretchable plastic film.  \nd. You may want to test for leaks by immersing the respirometer with the plug and pipette before filling it with reagents and cotton.\n\nFigure 8.4: Respirometers in water bath.\n\nBecause the gas law shows that volume depends on temperature as well as pressure, you must correct for any changes in volume that are a consequence of temperature variations rather than respiration. To do this, subtract changes in volumes measured in the respirometer containing glass beads from the changes in volume measured in the tubes containing germinating seeds held at the same temperature.\n\nThe ideal gas law shows that volume depends on temperature as well as pressure."

        "text": "Lab 9: Fermentation in Yeast\n\nYeast carry out fermentation as a means to access the chemical energy from their food, which, in this case, will be sugars such as glucose. Yeast can exist in a state of dormancy, where they are alive, but their physical activity has temporarily stopped to minimize energy use. This adaptation allows these organisms to survive extended periods of drought and other harsh environmental conditions. As you add water to the dry yeast, you will be activating the cells out of dormancy, and they will resume physical activity and begin eating. Once the yeast absorbs the food molecule, it will first break the molecule down in a process called glycolysis. The word glycolysis literally translates into the breaking apart of glucose and this is the first step of the metabolism of sugars (Figure 9.1).\n\nShortly after mixing the activated yeast with the sugar molecules, fermentation will begin, and you will be able to observe gas bubbles being produced. This gas is carbon dioxide, one of the products of fermentation.\n\nFigure 9.1: Glycolysis is the first step of both aerobic respiration and fermentation. Aerobic respiration only produces carbon dioxide as a toxic byproduct, but fermentation also produces alcohol or lactate.\n\nActivity 2: Dependence of Fermentation on Temperature\n\nAll cellular processes, like fermentation, consist of an interconnected series of chemical reactions. However, temperature can influence the rate of chemical reactions by affecting how quickly the reactants move, and therefore, how often they collide with each other. If the temperature gets too high, enzymes or other cellular proteins involved with cellular respiration can break apart, or denature, rendering them inactive. Therefore, it is very important for cells and organisms to regulate their internal temperature to ensure that cellular respiration and other chemical reactions can continue at the proper rate.\n\nThe ideal gas law shows that volume depends on temperature as well as pressure..\nPrepare the first beaker with 100 ml of water at room temperature, approximately 21 \u00b0C. Add cold or hot water to get the water as close to 21 \u00b0C as possible. Once the temperature is stable, place the graduated cylinder containing the yeast and sugar substitute directly into the water beaker. Record the actual temperature of the room temperature solution.\n\nFor the cold water treatment, fill the beaker with cold water and then add ice. Wait until the temperature stabilizes before beginning the timer. For the hot water beaker, bring the water to a boil using a hot plate. Then, turn down the hot plate to maintain the water at a low boil. Record the stabilized temperatures for both treatments before immersing the graduated cylinders containing the yeast into the beakers.\n\nHypothesize/Predict: More extreme temperatures, such as (~ 0\u20134 \u00b0C) and (55\u201360 \u00b0C), affect the rate of fermentation. \n\nPick two additional temperatures to test within the range (~ 0\u20134 \u00b0C) and (55\u201360 \u00b0C). Use the water, ice, hot plate, and thermometer to make these baths before adding the graduated cylinders containing the yeast and sugar substitute solutions. Perform trials measuring the volume of gas in the balloon.\n\nAnalyze how temperature affects the rate of fermentation for this species of yeast.

The chloroplast is surrounded by a double membrane. Within the inner membrane is a fluid compartment called the stroma. The thylakoids form a complex network of membranes that appear as stacked disks called grana (singular, granum). The photosystems, and photosynthetic pigments they contain, are embedded in the thylakoid membrane. Carbon fixation takes place in the stroma.  \n\nSafety Precautions  \nWash your hands after completion of this activity.  \n\nMaterials needed:  \nPlant material: intact leaves of spinach and Coleus (one leaf of each per pair of students), filter or chromatography paper, ruler, coins, pencils, colored pencils, forceps, scissors.  \n\nFigure 10.1: A section through a chloroplast shows the arrangement of the thylakoid membranes in stacks and single membranes. The thylakoids are pockets enclosed by membranes.  \n\nStructured Inquiry  \nStep 3:  \n1. Measure the height and the diameter (D) of the container to determine the size of the piece of chromatography paper needed. Subtract 1 cm from the height of the container. The width of the chromatography paper should be about 1 cm shorter than the circumference of the container.  \n2. With a pencil, draw a line across the entire width of filter/chromatography paper about 1.5 cm from the bottom. This line is called the origin or start of the separation. It is the place where the sample is applied.  \n3. Select 1 large spinach leaf and carefully blot it dry with paper towels.  \n4. Position the leaf on top of the pencil line leaving a space on each end. The leaf should reach the edge of the paper.  \n5. Align a plastic ruler over the leaf with the edges of the pencil line that was left uncovered by the leaf.  \n6. Roll a coin pressing down firmly along the ruler edge without crushing the rest of the leaf and smearing pigment on the surface of the filter paper. Lay the filter paper on top of paper towels taking care not to cover the line where the pigments are deposited.  \n7. Let the pigment line dry for 3 to 5 minutes. Move to a different section of the leaf and roll the coin again over the same line. Keep the band of pigments as narrow as possible. The pigments will diffuse during separation and the bands will smear if they are laid down too thick.  \n\nFigure 10.2: Extract pigments by rolling a coin along a ruler. Make sure that the leaf does not cover the entire paper and align the ruler with the starting line to avoid edge effects.  \n\nGuided Inquiry  \nStep 3: Observe the pigment lines on the paper. Record the color or colors detected. Note the differences, if any, between the spinach and Coleus samples.  \n\nFigure 10.3: This graph shows the light penetration in the open ocean as a spectrum of color from violet to red. The depth of the ocean is measured in meters, and the peak light penetration occurs in blue light, which progresses past 200 m..\nPhotosynthetic pigments are hydrophobic molecules located in thylakoid membranes.\n\nPaper chromatography is an analytical method that separates compounds based on their solubility in a solvent. The solvent is used to separate a mixture of molecules that have been applied to filter paper. The paper, made of cellulose, represents the stationary or immobile phase. The separation mixture moves up the paper by capillary action. It is called the mobile phase. The results of chromatography are recorded in a chromatogram.\n\nCompounds which are soluble in the solvent mixture are more concentrated in the mobile phase and move faster up the paper. Polar compounds will bind to the cellulose in the paper and trail behind the solvent front. As a result, the different compounds will separate according to their solubility in the mixture of organic solvents used for chromatography.\n\nSafety Precautions:\n- Work under a hood or in a well-ventilated space and avoid breathing solvents.\n- Do not have any open flames when working with flammable solvents.\n- Wear aprons and eye protection.\n- Do not pour any organic solvent down the drain.\n- Dispose of solvents per local regulations.\n- Use forceps to handle chromatography paper that has been immersed in solvent and wash your hands after completing this activity.\n\nFor this activity, the freshly prepared solvent mixture is petroleum ether: acetone: water in a 3:1:1 proportion. If no hood or well-ventilated place is available, the mixture can be substituted with 95 percent isopropyl alcohol. Note that, if isopropyl alcohol is used, the pigment bands will smear. You may not be able to separate and identify the chlorophylls or carotene from xanthophyll.\n\nTo prepare the chromatogram, cut a piece of filter paper. Transfer pigments from spinach leaves. A heavy application line will yield stronger colors when the pigments separate, making it easier to read results. Allow the pigments to dry between applications. Wet extracts diffuse on the paper and yield blurry lines.\n\nForm a cylinder with the filter paper without overlapping the edges (to avoid edge effects). The sample should face the outside of the cylinder. Secure the top and bottom of the cylinder with staples.\n\nPour enough separation mixture to provide a mobile phase while staying below the origin line on the chromatogram. The origin is the start line where the solvent is applied.\n\nLower the paper into the container with the band from the extraction in the lower section. The paper must touch the solvent, but not reach the band of pigment applied.\n\nCover the container tightly with a piece of aluminum foil.\n\nWhen the solvent front is within 1 cm of the upper edge of the paper, remove the cylinder from the beaker using forceps. Trace the solvent front with a pencil before it evaporates and disappears. The colors will fade upon drying.\n\nLet the paper dry in a well-ventilated area before making measurements because the wet paper is fragile and may break when handled. This is also a precaution to avoid breathing fumes from the chromatogram.\n\nDiscard solvent mixture per local regulations. Do not pour down the drain.\n\nThe retention factor (Rf) is the ratio of the distance traveled by a colored band to the distance traveled by the solvent front. Calculate Rf values for each pigment using the following equation:\n\nRf = (Distance traveled by colored band) / (Distance traveled by solvent front)\n\nCarotenoids and chlorophylls are hydrophobic molecules that dissolve in organic solvents.\n\nAll chlorophyll molecules contain a complexed magnesium ion.\n\nSeeds that grow under dim light are said to be etiolated, which describes their pale and spindly appearance. They soon waste away after exhausting their food reserves."

The reaction is reversible. When CO2 molecules are consumed by photosynthesis, the reaction shifts to the left. Hydrogen ions and bicarbonate ions combine to replace CO2 with the net effect of increasing the pH of the solution.\n\nA pH indicator is a chemical compound that changes color based on pH level. Phenol red appears yellow at pH below 7, orange at neutral pH, and bright red or pink at basic pH values.\n\nIf the starting phenol solution is a light shade of pink, blowing bubbles into the solution until it turns bright yellow indicates a change in pH.\n\nIf the color is close to red or pink, it means that the tap water is basic. Freshly distilled water has a pH of 7.0. As CO2 from the atmosphere dissolves in the distilled water, the pH drops below 7.0.\n\nWhen measuring the effect of light intensity, use the equation I = 1/D\u00b2 where I is light intensity and D is distance.\n\nThe temperature can be kept constant by placing the tube in a water bath.\n\nLED lamps radiate less heat making it possible to bypass the use of a heat sink.\n\nSafety Precautions:  \n- Be careful when blowing into the straw inside the reaction vessels.

A small drop of dishwashing soap in the solution breaks the surface tension of the leaf disks and allows the bicarbonate to penetrate inside the leaf. The bicarbonate in the solution provides a source of CO2 for photosynthesis.\n\nThe inner leaf spaces in a leaf are normally filled with air. When a bicarbonate solution is forced into those air spaces, the leaf disks become heavier and sink to the bottom of the solution.\n\nAs photosynthesis proceeds, the oxygen produced by PSII pushes liquid out of the air spaces and eventually bubbles out of the disks, which float to the surface.\n\nBy monitoring the time it takes the disks to float, the rate of photosynthesis can be estimated under various conditions.\n\nTo compare results of experiments, the estimated time for 50 percent of the disks to float to the surface, labeled as ET50, is used. This is a median value that allows discounting outliers, such as a floating disk that never sank in the first place or a disk stuck to the bottom of the cup.\n\nET50 values decrease when photosynthetic rates go up, so 1/ET50 may be plotted as a function of the independent variable.\n\nSafety Precautions:\n- Wear goggles and an apron.\n- Use caution while working with the lamp as light bulbs become very hot.\n- Use caution while handling glass.\n\nFor this activity, the following materials are needed:\n- Plant material: intact leaves of spinach and Coleus, and light-colored leaves such as iceberg lettuce, celery leaves or cabbage. Avoid fuzzy leaves that trap air on their surface and do not sink easily.\n- 0.2 M sodium bicarbonate solution (0.4 M, 0.6 M, and 0.8 M should be available).\n- Two to three plastic 10 mL syringes.\n- Clear plastic cups.\n- Dilute dishwashing soap solution.\n- Single-hole punch.\n- Lamps.\n- Acetate colored filters (at a minimum, use blue, red and green filters).\n- Aluminum foil.\n\nRecall that I = 1/D\u00b2, where I is the intensity of light and D is the distance between the light source and the target.\n\nIn an experiment, water is labeled with the radioactive O18 isotope. The labelled water is then supplied to the leaf disks. In a second experiment, CO2 labeled with the isotope O18 is supplied to the disks.\n\nDCMU (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea) is an herbicide that specifically inhibits transfer of electrons from PSII.\n\nThe effect of varying CO2 concentration is achieved by using different concentrations of a sodium bicarbonate buffer which releases CO2.\n\nPlant material differences, such as comparing the deep green leaves of spinach to the pale leaves of cabbage or celery, affect photosynthesis.\n\nLight intensity differences can be studied by changing the distance between the light source and the cup.\n\nThe inner leaf spaces in a leaf are normally filled with air.\n\nWhen a bicarbonate solution is forced into those air spaces, the leaf disks become heavier and sink to the bottom of the solution.\n\nAs photosynthesis proceeds, the oxygen produced by PSII pushes liquid out of the air spaces and eventually bubbles out of the disks, which float to the surface.\n\nThe estimated time for 50 percent of the disks to float to the surface, labeled as ET50, is used to estimate the rate of photosynthesis.\n\nET50 values decrease when photosynthetic rates go up, so 1/ET50 may be plotted as a function of the independent variable.\n\nThe intensity of light (I) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance (D) from the light source, expressed as I = 1/D\u00b2.\n\nPhotosynthesis involves light-dependent reactions where oxygen is produced by Photosystem II (PSII).\n\nDCMU inhibits electron transfer from PSII, thereby affecting oxygen production.\n\nThe presence of DCMU in an aquatic environment would reduce oxygen production by photosynthetic organisms but does not directly affect animals such as water snails.\n\nGas bubbles produced by photosynthesis in aquatic plants like Elodea are oxygen.\n\nTemperature affects the rate of photosynthesis and the evolution of oxygen.\n\nDifferent wavelengths of light affect the rate of photosynthesis, with chlorophyll absorbing mainly blue and red light, and carotenoids absorbing blue-green light.\n\n"

        "text": "Lab 12: Photosynthesis: The Dark Reactions\n\nIn this lab, you will learn\n\u25cf how to test for the presence of starch in plant leaves\n\u25cf how to determine the effect of light on starch accumulation.\n\nActivity 1: Testing for the Presence of Starch in Plant Leaves  \nWe could use a colorimetric indicator for starch that changes color to detect any color change when starch is present. However, this may be problematic since plant leaves, like those of spinach, are quite green due to the presence of chlorophyll, and this may mask any color formation if we use a colorimetric indicator for starch.  \nIn this lab, to circumvent the problem mentioned above, you will first boil leaves in a solution of 70 percent ethanol to remove chlorophyll. Following this, you will then stain the now chlorophyll-free leaves with iodine, a dark red indicator that complexes with starch, turning bluish-black. This bluish-black color can be seen in Figure 12.1, where a starchy seed has been stained with a drop of iodine.\n\nFigure 12.1: Iodine complexes with starch to form a bluish-black color, as seen here after a drop of iodine was added to this cross section of a starchy seed.\n\nSafety Precautions  \n\u25cf Ethanol is highly flammable and should not be exposed to open flames.  \n\u25cf Wear eye protection when working with solutions of 70 percent ethanol and iodine.  \n\u25cf Use caution when using iodine solution as it may stain skin and/or clothing.  \n\u25cf Use caution when handling hot liquids.  \n\u25cf Inform your teacher immediately of any broken glassware, as it could cause injuries.  \n\u25cf Clean up any spilled fluids to prevent people from slipping.\n\nActivity 2: Determining the Effect of Light on Starch Accumulation  \nWhile the name of the dark reactions suggests that they can happen in the dark, can they? No, a better name for the dark reactions of the Calvin cycle is the light-independent reactions. By light-independent we mean that the Calvin cycle does not involve the free energy of the sun directly. However, for the Calvin cycle to occur, the light reactions\u2014or more precisely, the light-dependent reactions\u2014carried out by photosynthetic pigments within thylakoid membranes, must occur to convert the free energy from the sun into chemical free energy in the form of NADPH and ATP. The dark reactions must be continually supplied with NADPH and ATP from the light reactions in order to continue, even if the dark reactions do not directly involve the sun.\n\nOne problem that some plants living in hot climates encounter is balancing their need for CO2 to carry out the dark reactions with their need to retain water. While opening stomata on leaf surfaces to get CO2 for carbon fixation, plants living in these conditions risk a major loss of water, and become dehydrated. However, if they close their stomata to retain water, the O2 produced as a by-product of the light reactions can accumulate inside plant cells and serve as an alternative substrate to RuBisCO when CO2 levels are low. This process, called photorespiration, is harmful to the plants in that it significantly reduces carbohydrate production by the dark reactions, using up NADPH and ATP without fixing CO2 (Figure 12.2), while also using O2 that otherwise would be used as a terminal electron acceptor during respiration to make ATP. Photorespiration is problematic for C3 plants, those lacking any mechanism to avoid this, which are named as such because the first fixed carbon product contains 3 carbons.\n\nFigure 12.2: Photorespiration occurs when cellular O2 levels are high and CO2 levels are low. When this occurs, RuBisCO may bind to O2 instead of its typical substrate CO2. This results in the use of NADPH and ATP without the production of carbohydrates.\n\nSome plants have evolved mechanisms to overcome photorespiration (Figure 12.3). In some plants, called the C4 plants, CO2 is first added to a 3-carbon molecule to produce a 4-carbon molecule in a mesophyll cell on the plant leaf\u2019s exterior. This mesophyll cell then serves as a CO2 supply for a more internal cell, called a bundle sheath cell. The mesophyll cell releases CO2 from the 4-carbon molecule directly in the bundle sheath cell\u2019s vicinity. Interestingly, due to their distinct adaptive advantage, C4 plants evolved independently multiple times in different plant lineages. One commercially significant C4 plant is corn.\n\nOther plants, called CAM plants, evolved a pathway known as crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). CAM plants open their stomata at night, allowing them to retain their water but also allowing the flow of CO2 into the plants. This CO2 is then added to a 3-carbon molecule to produce a 4-carbon molecule, which serves as a CO2 source during the day, when the plant\u2019s stomata are closed. While these mechanisms are similar, C4 plants spatially separate the incorporation of CO2 into the 4-carbon molecule in a cell different from the one carrying out the Calvin cycle, while these two activities occur in the same cell, but at different times, in CAM plants. Cacti and succulents are examples of CAM plants.\n\nFigure 12.3: To avoid photorespiration, plants have evolved strategies to either spatially (C4 plants) or temporally (CAM plants) separate the incorporation of CO2 into a 4-carbon molecule, which subsequently serves as a CO2 source, from the Calvin cycle..\nStructured Inquiry\n\nFigure 12.4: Cover several leaves of a potted plant with black strips, securing with paper clips.\n\nAssessments\n\n1. How does sun exposure affect the dark reactions\u2019 conversion of the chemical free energy from NADPH and ATP to that of carbohydrates? Explain.\n\n2. Consider a C3 plant grown in hot, dry conditions compared to humid conditions. How do you predict the acquisition of chemical free energy in the form of carbohydrates will compare between these two conditions? Explain. Make a graphical model of your prediction. How would plant growth be affected?\n\n3. Compare how the acquisition of chemical free energy in the form of carbohydrates is affected by humidity in C3 plants compared to C4 plants?"

        "text": "Mitosis and Meiosis\n\nAll organisms have the need to stay alive and reproduce. Mitosis addresses the need for cell growth, maintenance, and repair. During interphase, the cell\u2019s DNA is replicated so that there are two copies of each chromosome, called the sister chromatids. In eukaryotes, all chromosomes must be duplicated prior to mitosis and cytokinesis to ensure each new daughter cell has the full complement of genetic information. Other structures, such as organelles, are replicated during the G1 portion of the cell cycle.\n\nMitosis is divided into specific phases. During prophase, the chromosomes coil up, and sister chromatids become visible under a microscope. The nuclear membrane surrounding the chromosomes also disappears. In metaphase, the sister chromatids align in the center of the cell, attached to spindle fibers. During anaphase, the sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles of the cell. In telophase, the chromosomes arrive at the poles and begin to decondense while the nucleus reforms. The phases transition without stopping. Important structures include spindle fibers and kinetochores on the centromeres of each chromosome. Each pair of sister chromatids has a protein structure, called a kinetochore, which becomes attached to spindle fibers. The spindle fibers pull the sister chromatids apart, toward opposite ends of the cell.\n\nCancer is the uncontrolled growth and mitotic division of cells. Some chemotherapy drugs, including taxanes such as Taxol from the yew tree and alkaloids from the vinca plant, interfere with mitosis by binding to microtubules and preventing spindle fibers from separating sister chromatids, thus leading to cell death.\n\nMitosis is divided into five stages: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.\n\nIn plant cells, mitosis is used for growth, maintenance, and repair. The plant\u2019s cell wall, as well as the nuclear material, makes observing mitosis easier. During cytokinesis, an animal cell pinches apart into two daughter cells, while a plant cell develops a new cell wall, called a cell plate, between the new daughter cells.\n\nMeiosis is the process in sexually reproducing eukaryotes that forms sex cells or gametes, which include sperm and eggs (ova). To avoid doubling the number of chromosomes in each generation, reduction division (halving the number of chromosomes) in gamete production is necessary. Meiosis uses very similar mechanisms to mitosis. There are, however, several significant differences. The source cells for meiosis are found in the reproductive organs of animals (gonads: ovaries and testes) and plants (flowers: ovaries and anthers). Major differences between mitosis and meiosis include the association of homologous chromosomes (sister chromatids of the same chromosomes) attached as a tetrad group of four, as well as crossover of chromosome regions during prophase I of meiosis I. Crossover provides one source of genetic variation in offspring..\nHumans have 23 different chromosomes. Note that we have a diploid (2N) set of chromosomes: a full set of 23 chromosomes received from the sperm and another set of 23 from the ovum (egg) during fertilization. During metaphase I of meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are separated. The chromosome number is reduced from diploid (2N) to haploid (1N) by the end of meiosis I, with each cell retaining duplicate sister chromatids. Meiosis II results in four haploid (1N) cells in sperm, each with only one set of each of the 23 chromosomes. In female humans, meiosis results in uneven division of the cytoplasm and the formation of two polar bodies (nuclei only) that are not involved in fertilization. One note about human fertilization: meiosis II is completed only after the sperm has entered the ovum.\n\nThere are several malfunctions that can occur during meiosis. Nondisjunction occurs when the sister chromatids in tetrads separate unevenly. Nondisjunction results in one cell getting an extra chromosome while another cell is missing a chromosome. Nondisjunction is associated with certain human genetic disorders. For example, Down syndrome is usually caused by nondisjunction that results in three copies of chromosome 21. Translocations can occur when chromosomes exchange genetic information with nonhomologous chromosomes.\n\nKaryotypes (chromosome spreads) are made by stopping cells in mitosis with a chemical and then dyeing with Giemsa stain. A picture is taken through a microscope and then digitally enlarged to see the chromosomal banding, or G-bands. Dark and light banding patterns help identify chromosomes and alterations to normal chromosomes. Human females have two X chromosomes, and males have one X and one Y."

        "text": "Robertsonian translocation involves a fusion of the long arms of two non-homologous chromosomes during meiosis. A patient possessing a Robertsonian translocation among chromosome 14 onto chromosome 13 has no genetic material missing from either chromosome.\n\nBased on the principles set forth by Mendel, we can predict what genotypes and phenotypes offspring will have based on the genotypes and phenotypes of their parents. One efficient way to do this involves using a Punnett square. A Punnett square is a grid where all the alleles of one parent are provided as the column headers while all of the alleles from the second parent are provided as the row headers. When the alleles from the two parents are combined in the grid, the internal squares predict the genotypes of their offspring. Multiple Punnett squares can predict offspring genotypes across several generations. The first filial generation (F1) is the offspring that results from crossing the original, parental generation. The second filial generation (F2) is the offspring that results from crossing F1 individuals.\n\nFigure 14.1: A Punnett square is used as a visual representation of crossed traits and the results of the crosses. Capital R represents the dominant trait, and lowercase r represents the recessive trait. The first square is a cross between the two dominant traits R and R. RR is the result.\n\nThe chi-square test is an independence test for the likelihood that an observed distribution is due to chance. Chi-square is calculated using the following equation:\n\nX\u00b2 = \u03a3 [(O - E)\u00b2 / E]\n\nwhere X is the chi-square test statistic, c is the significant level of the test (commonly 0.05), O is the observed value for variable i, and E is the expected value for variable i.\n\nTo interpret the data, use a standard chi-square table. On the left side of the table is the degree of freedom (df), which is calculated by subtracting 1 from the number of categories in the data. Across the top is the probability (p-value), or the probability that the observed value matches the expected value. It is used to determine whether the null hypothesis should be accepted or rejected. The null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference between the groups being measured.\n\nThe null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference between the groups being measured.\n\nThe degree of freedom in a chi-square test is calculated by subtracting 1 from the number of categories in the data.\n\nThe expected data in a chi-square test would be the number of individuals that should possess the different phenotypes based on the ratios predicted by Mendelian inheritance for each cross."

In gel electrophoresis, DNA fragments are inserted into a gel medium called agarose. The DNA will be loaded onto a gel using loading dye, which helps visualize the movement of the charged molecules through the agarose gel. The loading dye also contains a viscous sugar solution to ensure that the DNA sample sinks into the small depressions in the gel, called wells. The loading dyes do not actually stain the DNA during electrophoresis.  \n\nTo judge the size of a DNA fragment, molecular size markers, or just markers, are inserted into the gel next to the DNA fragments. The marker contains DNA fragments of several known sizes. They are used to estimate the length of an unknown DNA fragment. Visualizing DNA in the gel is problematic since it is transparent to the eye. Therefore, after the DNA has run through the gel, you will use a DNA stain to help visualize the DNA.  \n\nSafety Precautions  \n\u25cf Wash your hands before and after these activities.  \n\u25cf Never eat or drink in the lab. This lab involves the use of poisonous buffers, DNA stains, and other chemicals.  \n\u25cf Wearing aprons, gloves, and goggles are highly recommended. The DNA stain can stain hands and clothing, and can harm the skin.  \n\u25cf Use caution with hot agarose.  \n\u25cf If any solutions get into your eyes, flush with water.  \n\u25cf Use caution with electrical connections:  \n  o Set gel in box and load samples with the electrodes disconnected.  \n  o Turn off power supply before connecting or disconnecting gel box.  \n  o Turn off power supply and unplug all leads before handling the gel box and removing the gel.  \n\u25cf Dispose of used materials as indicated by your instructor.  \n\nFor this activity, you will need the following:  \n\u25cf Pre-digested DNA samples and control sample  \n\u25cf Two 20 \u00b5L micropipettes with \u00b5L pipette tips  \n\u25cf Waste container for used pipette tips  \n\u25cf Practice gels with practice loading dye (50 percent glycerol with methylene blue)  \n\u25cf 1 percent agarose in TAE buffer gel or premade agarose gel  \n\u25cf Masking tape (1-inch wide) (Not needed if gel trays have adjustable walls)  \n\u25cf Loading dye  \n\u25cf 1X TAE buffer  \n\u25cf Micro-centrifuge (optional)  \n\u25cf Electrophoresis gel box and power supply  \n\u25cf Staining trays  \n\u25cf DNA stain  \n\u25cf Lambda DNA  \n\u25cf Various restriction enzymes (availability determined by instructor)  \n\nCreating the Agarose Gel  \nStep 1: Determine the volume required by twisting the thumbwheel dial to the required volume. Numbers are read from top to bottom. There may be a red line indicating a decimal point in the display. For example, 015 with a red line between the 1 and 5 would read 1.5 \u00b5L.  \nStep 2: Attach (seat) a clean pipette tip by gently pushing the micropipette into the top of the tip. Be gentle removing the tip to avoid spilling the whole box.  \nStep 3: Press the push button (plunger) on top to the first (soft) stop. Insert the disposable pipette tip (only the tip) into the liquid to be transferred. Slowly release the push button to suck up the liquid. Note\u2014If you have pressed the push button too hard and gone to the harder blow-out setting you will pull up more than the desired volume.  \nStep 4: Insert the pipette tip into the microfuge tube or other area where you need to move the material.  \nStep 5: Press the push button past the first stop to the second (hard) stop to transfer (blow out) the liquid. Do not release the push button until you have removed the tip from the tube.  \nStep 6: Eject the disposable tip into the appropriate waste container. Do not reuse tips, unless instructed, to avoid cross contamination.  \n\nStep 2: Prepare your gel tray. Some trays have casting gates that can be locked before pouring the molten agarose. Other trays have open sides that must be taped with masking tape. Make sure the masking tape is tightly applied to the open edges of the gel tray. Place the comb across the tray.  \n\nStep 3: Pour the warm 1 percent agarose into your tray. If there are bubbles, use a clean micropipette tip to move the bubbles away from the comb. Wait until the gel has become opaque to ensure the agarose has solidified and is ready for use. This usually takes about 20 minutes at a room temperature of 21 \u00b0C. Once the gel is fully set, remove the comb slowly by pulling straight up on both ends of the comb.  \n\nLoading, Running and Staining the Agarose Gel:  \nStep 1: Fill the dish with tap water.  \nStep 2: Obtain a microfuge tube of practice loading dye. Draw up 5\u201310 \u00b5L of dye. Hover the tip over the well, just touching the surface of the liquid. The tip should make a slight dimple in the water surface. Slowly depress the plunger of the micropipette, releasing the loading dye into the well. The dye should fill the well. Pull the tip out of the liquid before releasing the push button.  \nStep 3: Obtain the pre-digested DNA samples and controls in microfuge tubes. Add 2 \u00b5L of loading dye to your samples. Use a new pipette tip for each. Cap each tube and pulse spin in the micro-centrifuge (alternately spin and then stop). To avoid damage and injury, let the rotor come to a complete stop. Do not stop the rotor with your fingers. When you remove your sample from the centrifuge, tap it on the table 3 times to help the heavier constituents settle to the bottom. Alternately you can tap the microfuge tube with your finger to coax the DNA and loading dye together into the bottom of the microfuge tube.  \n\nStep 4: Place your gel in the gel box. The wells should be oriented at the black terminal end (negative side). DNA is negatively charged.  \n\nStep 5: Add enough 1X TAE buffer to top your gel by 2 mm. Depending on the size of your gel box, this may be approximately 275 mL.  \n\nStep 6: Load your gel with the pre-digested DNA samples and control DNA, in the order indicated by your instructor. The samples contain the loading dye. Generally, the standard, which you will use to determine the size of your DNA samples, is placed into the left-most well. The other samples are loaded to the right of the standard.  \n\nStep 7: Place the top on the gel box with the red terminal aligned with the red side and the black terminal aligned with the black side. Plug the cords into the power supply. Red with red, black with black. If the terminals are misaligned, your gel will run backwards and off the gel, yielding no results.  \n\nStep 8: Turn on the power supply and run your loaded gel for the time described by your teacher. Generally, gels run for 20 minutes at 200 V using 0.25X TAE or 30 minutes at 100V using 1X TAE buffer.  \n\nStep 9: After the proper amount of time, the bands of loading dye on your gels should be approximately 2\u20133 cm from the opposite edge of the gel. Remove the top of the gel box. Then remove the gel tray, draining extra liquid back into the box. Carefully slide the gel off the tray into a staining tray. Your teacher will stain your gel, which allows you to visualize the bands of DNA fragments, and instruct you on when you can observe the results. Clean up your lab table.  \n\nStep 10: Once your gel is ready, your teacher will place it on a light table for better viewing. Place a millimeter ruler next to the gel and take a picture of the gel using your phone camera. Be sure to take a picture from directly above the gel, as you will use your photo to take measurements..\nFigure 15.5: Diagram of a gel that has been run.\n\nFigure 15.6: Example of a DNA Gel with Ruler.

You will insert a plasmid into a strain of bacteria that is receptive to taking up and expressing the plasmid. Just like in the Boyer and Cohen experiment, this plasmid contains a gene for antibiotic resistance. However, it is linked to a green fluorescent protein gene and a regulatory gene that is activated by the expression of antibiotic resistance. Bacteria that are not transformed typically die from being exposed to ampicillin. Your procedure involves two stages (Figure 16.1). Stage 1 represents the transformation stage, where you will induce the cells to take up the green-fluorescent and antibiotic-resistance genes. Stage 2 represents the analysis stage, where you will grow the bacteria to ensure you achieved transformation.\n\nFigure 16.1: The transformation process, in Stage 1.\n\nThe transformation being performed in this activity requires that cells be in a competent state. Competence is a condition in which the bacterial cells can pass DNA easily through their cell walls and cell membranes. This is achieved by placing the cells in a calcium chloride solution (CaCl2) and exposing them to a heat shock. Heat shock is the process of subjecting a cell to a higher temperature than ideal environmental temperature for a short period. The role of calcium chloride in the competence process is to counteract the electrostatic repulsion between the plasmid DNA and the bacterial cellular membrane. This allows the plasmid to come in contact with the cell membrane. The heat shock produces pores in bacterial cell membranes and permits the plasmid DNA to pass into the cell as shown in Figure 16.2. In this stage of transformation, you will make competent cells and then store them in the refrigerator until you complete the transformation process.\n\nFigure 16.2: Heat shock transformation of E. coli.\n\nSafety Precautions\n\u25cf Use caution when handling biological specimens.\n\u25cf Wear safety goggles throughout the duration of the laboratory activity.\n\u25cf It is highly recommended that you wear rubber gloves and a lab apron when handling any chemicals. In addition, use aseptic techniques in handling bacterial cultures to avoid infection.\n\u25cf Immediately inform your teacher of spills.\n\u25cf Inform your teacher immediately of any broken glassware, as it could cause injuries.\n\u25cf Clean up any spilled water or other fluids to prevent people from slipping.\n\u25cf Immediately wash your hands if they directly contact any chemicals or cultures. It is important to wash your hands after the laboratory activity to avoid any possible contamination of other surfaces with chemical residues or biological materials that might be on your hands.\n\nMaterials:\n\u25cf Surgical gloves\n\u25cf Safety goggles\n\u25cf Waterproof marker\n\u25cf Micro tube rack\n\u25cf Eight disposable 1 mL calibrated plastic needle-point pipettes (or adjustable micropipettes, if available)\n\u25cf Eight disposable plastic inoculating loops\n\u25cf 1 polystyrene warm-beverage cup filled with crushed ice\n\u25cf 20 \u00b5l micropipette (one per class)\n\u25cf Micropipette tips for class (for 20 \u00b5l micropipette)\n\u25cf 42 \u00b0C water bath (one per class)\n\u25cf Floating test tube holder (one per class)\n\u25cf 37 \u00b0C incubator\n\u25cf Parafilm\n\u25cf Blue LED light box (one per class)\n\u25cf Refrigerator\n\u25cf Biological hazardous waste container\n\nChemicals and Media:\n\u25cf One Luria broth media Petri plate\n\u25cf One Luria broth + Amp media Petri plate\n\u25cf One bottle of sterile Luria broth (one per class)\n\u25cf Squirt bottle with 10 percent bleach solution\n\u25cf Squirt bottle with 70% ethanol solution\n\u25cf Crushed ice\n\u25cf Micro tube filled with 50 mM CaCl2\n\u25cf Micro tube filled with Luria broth (two per group)\n\nLiving materials:\n\u25cf One streak plate of E. coli per group (Strain MM294 or competent E. coli cells)\n\u25cf One pGREEN or pGLO plasmid solution (0.005 \u00b5g/\u00b5l; one per class)\n\nStage 1: Inducing Competency and Transforming E. coli:\n\nThe transformation process involves growing bacteria on media containing ampicillin. Competent cells are prepared by transferring E. coli colonies into CaCl2 solution, which counteracts electrostatic repulsion between plasmid DNA and bacterial membranes. The cells are then exposed to heat shock at 42 \u00b0C for 90 seconds, which produces pores in the bacterial membranes allowing plasmid DNA to enter. Competent bacteria can be stored in the refrigerator for no more than two days.\n\nStage 2: Culturing the Bacteria\n\nAfter transformation, bacteria are incubated with Luria broth solution at room temperature for 10 minutes. The bacteria are then inoculated onto Luria broth + Amp media Petri plates to grow and assess transformation success..\nStep 4: After the 10-minute incubation period, use a pipette to transfer 100 \u00b5L of your \u2013 micro tube solution to the media in the lower half of the \u2013 plasmid Luria broth+Amp plate. Use a plastic sterile loop to spread the liquid evenly across the surface of the media. Dispose of both the needle-point pipette and the plastic sterile loop in the biohazardous waste container.  \n\nStep 5: Use a new disposable needle-point pipette to transfer 100 \u00b5L of your + micro tube solution to the media in the lower half of the + plasmid Luria broth + Amp plate. Use a plastic sterile loop to spread the liquid evenly across the surface of the media. Dispose of both the needle-point pipette and the plastic sterile loop in the biohazardous waste container.\n\nStep 6: Let the plates sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before moving.\n\nStep 7: Carefully carry your four plates for placement in a 37 oC incubator. Leave the plates in the incubator for 24 hours. If an incubator is not available, store the plates at room temperature for at least 72 hours. \n\nStep 8: Clean up:\nReturn all remaining materials to the teacher.\nPlace your micro tubes containing the bacteria into the biohazardous materials container or in an area designated by your teacher. \nObtain a squirt bottle with 70% ethanol solution and squeeze some ethanol onto your workspace. Wipe down the table with paper towels and place the used towels in the trash. Then wipe down the tables again with paper towels wetted with tap water. Dry the table with a fresh set of paper towels.\n\nStep 9: The E. coli you placed on the Luria broth media plates have now had time to multiply. As they multiplied, the E. coli with the pGREEN plasmid replicated the plasmid as well as their own DNA. The green fluorescent protein reporter gene is telling you that the ampicillin resistance gene is also being expressed. \n\nStep 10: Collect your four incubated Luria broth media plates and carefully carry them to your workspace. You should have the plates labeled as followed from Activity 1:\nLuria broth (LB) media petri plate \u2013 plasmid\nLuria broth with ampicillin (LB + Amp) media petri plate \u2013 plasmid\nLuria broth (LB) media petri plate + plasmid\nLuria broth with ampicillin (LB + Amp) media petri plate + plasmid\n\nStep 11: Carefully remove the Parafilm from each plate and dispose of the Parafilm in the biohazard container. (The Parafilm may have some bacterial contamination.) \n\nStep 12: Record your findings in your notebook. Draw the growth patterns of each plate. You may also want to take a photograph of each plate.\n\nStep 13: One at a time, remove the lid from each plate and illuminate the bacterial plates with the blue LED light boxes. Record your findings in your notebook. \n\nStep 14: Clean up:\nDispose of the four Petri plates in the biohazardous materials container or place in an area designated by your teacher.\nReturn the LED light boxes to the teacher.\nObtain the squirt bottle with 70% ethanol solution and squeeze some ethanol onto your workspace. Wipe down the table with paper towels and place the used towels in the trash. Then wipe down the tables again with paper towels wetted with tap water. Dry the table with a fresh set of paper towels.\n\nGuided Inquiry\nStep 1: In your initial experiment, you tested for transformation by growing your transformed and untreated bacteria on media containing the antibiotic ampicillin.  \n\nStep 2: Write out the steps to test your hypothesis about culturing non-transformed E. coli and transformed E. coli having the pGREEN vector on plain LB plates.\n\nStep 3: Carry out the procedure you devised in Step 2.\n\nStep 4: Compared to the growth on the LB + Amp plates, what additional information did you discover by growing the non-transformed and transformed bacteria on the plain LB plates? What is the value of using the GFP reporter gene in assessing the success of cell transformation?\n\nAssessments\nExplain why ampicillin must be placed in the Luria broth medium used to grow the transformed cells.\n\nExplain why the heat shock step is essential for transformation to occur. \n\nIn this activity, you induced competence in E. coli cells. However, certain environmental conditions that stress bacteria can induce a natural competence. What is the value of competence to survival under stressful conditions? \n\nDescribe how your results would most likely change if the ampicillin-resistance gene underwent a severe mutation within the bacteria.\n\nDraw the gene sequence that shows why expression of the ampicillin-resistance gene also causes the expression of the green fluorescent protein.\n\nHeat shock transformation does not guarantee that all bacteria will take up plasmids or that all bacteria will have the same number of plasmids. \n\nExtension Activities 3: \nCarry out a study to determine whether exposure of the pGREEN plasmid to ultraviolet light affects the expression of the plasmid. \n\nPerform a DNA extraction on E .coli cells to determine whether you can isolate the pGREEN plasmid from the transformed cells on the LB plate + plasmid and the LB+Amp plate + plasmid. Then use the polymerase chain reaction and electrophoresis to confirm the results."

Are there more individuals with the dominant phenotype? With the recessive phenotype? How does this compare to your group\u2019s data? Is either population (group or class) in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium? Discuss your answer with your group members and write your responses in your notebook.  \n\nA population of bears has individuals with black fur (dominant) or brown fur (recessive). Black bears have the genotype BB or Bb. Brown bears have the genotype bb. The frequency of the BB genotype is 0.59.  \n\nLab 18: Natural Selection Simulation  \n\nIn this lab, you will learn  \n- how one organism is naturally selected over another  \n- how natural selection occurs over multiple generations  \n- how environmental factors affect natural selection  \n\nActivity 1: Survival of the Fittest  \nIn natural selection, any inherited trait that makes survival likely for an individual is an adaptation. Those individuals that are best adapted to a given environment are more likely to survive and reproduce.  \n\nNatural selection depends on the environment, as environmental factors drive natural selection. For example, a pond suddenly becomes a river as a result of flooding within a region. The flooding results in the loss of many animals, and only a few of the strongest survive. Natural disasters, climate change, chemicals that trigger mutation, and pH levels are all examples of environmental changes that might affect diversity or variation within a population.  \n\nFigure 18.1: Green caterpillars can easily blend in with their environment, increasing their chances of survival.  \n\nStructured Inquiry  \nStep 1: Collect an assortment of 30\u201350 pipe cleaners, roughly half of each color. Place five of each color on a plate that will represent the habitat. Set the others aside. These will be offspring.  \n\nStep 2: Hypothesize/Predict: Hypothesize about which caterpillars might survive better. Make a prediction that describes what will happen if a predator takes caterpillars at random, regardless of color, and then the remaining caterpillars only mate with caterpillars of the same color. Predict how the population will change over multiple generations if neither color confers an advantage.  \n\nStep 3: Student-Led Planning: You will record the number of individuals displaying each phenotype for 10 generations (i.e., the number of brown and green caterpillars). Create a table that will allow you to monitor each generation. Then, for each generation, first, determine the initial percentage of each color and record this information in your notebook. Remove three caterpillars of random colors from the habitat plate. To make this random, close your eyes and randomly remove three caterpillars. (These are the ones that died.) Set them aside in a dead caterpillar pile. Close your eyes again and randomly select three caterpillars to mate. Temporarily remove them from the habitat plate to make recording data easier. Then pair them with their same-colored mates from the habitat plate. The offspring will be the same color as the parents and will be chosen from the extra caterpillar plate (not the dead caterpillar pile). For example, if you randomly selected two green caterpillars and one brown caterpillar, and those were able to pair and mate, select two greens and one brown from the extra caterpillar pile as offspring for the pairs. Record your results in your data table. Put the parents and offspring on the habitat plate. Repeat for nine more generations, or until you run out of caterpillars.  \n\nGuided Inquiry 1  \nStep 1: Using 30\u201350 green and brown pipe cleaner caterpillars, repeat the steps in the Structured Inquiry. This time, you will choose a selective advantage. Discuss with your group what the selective advantages might be and record your responses in your notebook.  \n\nStep 2: Hypothesize/Predict: In green grass, which color would have a selective advantage? Why? Hypothesize about which caterpillar might survive better, then make a prediction that describes the future population of the caterpillars. How do you think the population will change over 10 generations?  \n\nStep 3: Student-Led Planning: With your group, decide on one trait that will confer a selective advantage to one color or the other. For example, if you decided that brown caterpillars are more visible to predators, choose two brown caterpillars to die. Then, choose the caterpillars that will mate. Color will not affect the ability to mate, so close your eyes to choose two caterpillars that will mate. Pair them with mates. Then add two additional caterpillars, of the same color that mated, to represent the offspring of the mating. This signifies the end of this generation. Repeat for nine more generations and record the number of green versus brown caterpillars at the start and end of each generation.  \n\nGuided Inquiry 2  \nStep 1: Student-Led Planning: Pick another phenotype that could apply a selective advantage (e.g., reproductive success or protection against predators). Describe your phenotype to your teacher, including what advantage it gives to individuals that possess that phenotype and how that advantage will be simulated with the pipe cleaners. After your teacher approves, describe your phenotype in your notebook.  \n\nStep 2: Hypothesize/Predict: Predict how natural selection would occur with the new phenotype and hypothesize how it will affect the phenotypic frequencies of the population after 10 generations. Use the same simulation procedure from Guided Inquiry 1. How would the frequency of brown and green change after a natural disaster? Write your hypothesis in your notebook.  \n\nStep 3: Think about how you will simulate change in selection that occurs after a natural disaster. For example, you might decide that damage from a fire is brief, so for one or two generations, only green caterpillars die. Then things go back to normal. Or maybe the damage is severe and lasts for five generations. Change your selection based on your decision and continue. Write your plan in your notebook.  \n\nStep 4: Critical Analysis: Make a graph that depicts changes over the 10 generations. How does the percentage of each phenotype change over time? Discuss your answer with your group, and write it in your notebook."

This device creates water potential, which will allow you to measure transpiration.\n\nWhen transpiration takes place, water evaporates from open stomata. As the water potential difference increases between the bottom of the stem and the leaves, the stem draws in water from the tube, and the water level drops in the pipette.\n\nPlants will open or close stomata based on many factors. Stomata help regulate the water needs of the plant and exchange gases with the environment. If there is too much water inside the cells, stomata will open to release the pressure. If water pressure is low, stomata will remain closed to retain moisture. However, to keep water moving up from the roots and into the leaves, some stomata do need to open to build the negative pressure that allows roots to draw up water. Special cells, called guard cells, act like doors to open or close stomata.\n\nTranspiration takes place through open stomata, generally scattered across the underside of leaves. A single stoma consists of two small guard cells above the large open air space within the leaf tissue. The guard cells contain darkened areas..\n"
