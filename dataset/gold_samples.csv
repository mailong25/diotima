Recognise (remembering),"The pancreas, illustrated in Figure 28.19, is an elongated organ that is located between the stomach and the proximal portion of the small intestine. It contains both exocrine cells that excrete digestive enzymes and endocrine cells that release hormones. It is sometimes referred to as a heterocrine gland because it has both endocrine and exocrine functions.",Name a gland in the body that has both exocrine and endocrine function,The Pancreas or liver or kidney or testes or ovaries,The answer includes pancreas or liver or kidney or testes or ovaries with correct spelling,The answer includes pancreas or liver or kidney or testes or ovaries but spelling is incorrect,incorrect or irrelevant gland named,incorrect or irrelevant gland named,The thyroid gland is a gland in the body that has both exocrine and endocrine functions because it releases hormones into the blood and also helps with digestion.,Partial response,You have named a gland however it is not one of the glands in the body that is both endocrine and exocrine.  The function is also incorrect.  Please refer to the relevant section of your textbook to review
Identify (remembering),"In eukaryotes, the genome consists of several double-stranded linear DNA molecules (Figure 10.3). Each species of eukaryotes has a characteristic number of chromosomes in the nuclei of its cells. Human body cells have 46 chromosomes, while human gametes (sperm or eggs) have 23 chromosomes each. A typical body cell, or somatic cell, contains two matched sets of chromosomes, a configuration known as diploid. The letter n is used to represent a single set of chromosomes; therefore, a diploid organism is designated 2n. Human cells that contain one set of chromosomes are called gametes, or sex cells; these are eggs and sperm, and are designated 1n, or haploid.",Name a human cell that is haploid,Sperm cell or male gamete or egg cell or female gamete,The answer includes sperm cell or male gamete or egg cell or female gamete with correct spelling,The answer includes sperm cell or male gamete or egg cell or female gamete but spelling is incorrect,incorrect or irrelevant human cell named,incorrect or irrelevant human cell named,"A human gamete, like a sperm cell or an egg cell, is haploid because it contains only one set of chromosomes.",Comprehensive response,You have named both a sperm cell and an egg cell.  Both are the correct answer.  You have also clarified why they are haploid

Or the answer may reference the stability of the DNA code during cell replication and how epigenetic tags are also replicated when the DNA of a cell is replicated but when gametes are produced that some of the tags may be removed.,The answer does not compare genetic and epigenetic mechanisms and demonstrates a poor understanding of their relevance to each other.  ,"Genetic mechanisms involve changes to the actual DNA sequence, like mutations, which can be inherited and directly affect the function of genes. Epigenetic mechanisms, on the other hand, don't change the DNA sequence itself but instead involve modifications like DNA methylation or histone modification that influence how genes are turned on or off. While genetic changes are permanent unless reversed by another mutation, epigenetic changes can be reversible and are often influenced by environmental factors. Both mechanisms play important roles in how traits are expressed and can contribute to diseases, but they operate at different levels of gene regulation.",Competent response,This is a good answer however to move up to the next level it would be important to demonstrate understanding of what happens to cellular DNA and epigenetic tags during cellular DNA replication as well as what happens to epigenetic tags during gamete production

Between hearbeats the pressure is less as the heart muscle relaxes.  The force of the high pressure blood caused by each heartbeat results in the expansion of arteries.  This is known as the pulse and can be felt at points in the body where an artery is close to the surface.  The average resting pulse rate in a healthy adult is 70-80 beats per minute.,"The answer accurately explains how the pressure increases in the arteries as each heartbeat pushes out the blood and then the pressure reduces as the the heart muscle relaxes between contractions.  The answer also explains how the high pressure forces the blood through the arteries causing them to expand, which can be felt at points in the body where arteries are close to the surface.  The answer also provides the average resting pulse rate of a healthy adult as 70-80 beats per minute.",The answer explains that heartbeats causes an increase in pressure in the arteries but may not relate that to what is happening to the muscles of the heart.  The answer may or may not state that this causes high pressure in the arteries and explain what happens to the arteries and how we can detect this.  The answer states that the average resting pulse rate of a healthy adult as 70-80 beats per minute.,The answer may mention that the heart causes an increase in pressure in the arteries but does not explain why.  The answer may mention that it is possible to measure the heartbeat at certain points in the body but does not explain why.  The answer may give a good approximation of the average resting pulse rate of a healthy adult as 70-80 beats per minute.,The answer demonstrates a poor understanding of the pulse and the mechanics of the heart and its affect on arteries.  The student may or may not know the average resting pulse rate of a healthy adult as 70-80 beats per minute.,The pulse is caused by blood moving in the veins and it happens when the heart beats. The average pulse rate in humans is about 200 beats per minute.,Limited response,The answer demonstrates a poor understanding of the mechanisms of the heart and the difference between the veins and the arteries.  The answer also provides a pulse rate that is not within normal ranges.  Please refer to the relevant section of the textbook to review.
